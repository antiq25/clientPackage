The drive-thru intercom, encrusted with grime, emits an eerie hum, as if it's whispering tales of abandonment.\n\nStepping inside, the atmosphere is oppressive with a nauseating odor that combines the stench of rancid cooking oil, moldy carpets, and the faint scent of decay. The tiles on the floor, cracked and stained, crunch beneath your feet as if protesting the indignity they've suffered. Dim, flickering fluorescent lights cast eerie shadows across cracked plastic booths and wobbly, sticky tables. The once-vibrant red and yellow decor has faded into a murky palette of despair.\n\nBehind the counter, the staff's apathy is palpable. They move in slow motion, their uniforms tattered and stained. The kitchen is a horror show of neglect, with greasy surfaces and grimy fryers that haven't seen a cleaning in ages. Forgotten food remnants fester in the corners, and a colony of flies buzzes lazily around discarded wrappers.\n\nAs for the food, the offerings are a grim reminder of the restaurant's decline. Soggy, overcooked burgers and limp, wilted lettuce are served on stale buns, drowning in a sea of congealed cheese and tepid condiments. The fries are a sad heap of cold, withered potato sticks that crumble upon touch.\n\nThis decrepit, neglected Burger King should be shut down not only for its wretched appearance and unsanitary conditions but also for the risk it poses to public health. It's a disheartening testament to the importance of maintaining cleanliness and quality in the foodservice industry, and its continued operation is a disservice to both its employees and customers.",

The iced Coffee had no oreo taste but at least it tasted like coffee right? Fries were fresh and crispy but under seasoned. Asked for more packs of ketchup but I guess he underestimated my ketchup usage for those bland tasting fries. I still have a good 55% of fries left after my packets of ketchup was done.",

Anyway, while the crispy chicken and onion rings were really good we were extremely disappointed to see the boring and plain looking double roasted garlic king. No onions. No roasted garlic. Just two beef stacked and cheese at the very top. It made us feel nauseous after finishing it. It was not at all what the pictures on their website/menu showed.

If I eat raw onions I get hives.  When I took it back to the counter, the woman who served me basically said it was my fault because I was talking to my friend when I was ordering.  Im not an idiot, I always ask for no onions.\nI told her that I was not talking to my friend and I specifically said no onions. She then backed off and made me a new burger. Afterwards I saw her whispering to her co-worker.  This is not the first time this has happened and I did the survey before and never got a response.  I will never go back to burger king again and I make sure to tell everyone of the bad service from the restaurant and the head office.\nObviously neither care about customer service, Mcdonalds  is located directly across the street and I will just go there.",
