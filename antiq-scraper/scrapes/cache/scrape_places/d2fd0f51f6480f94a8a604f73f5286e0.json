While it is somewhat small inside the food here was incredible. The sandwiches were very large with a lot of meat on them and the flavors and textures they added made these sandwiched unique in their own way. The fries here were also really good as they were very crisp on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. I would definitely recommend anyone that is passing by to come and eat here.",

The burger buns were homemade as they meticulously explained. The beef patty was VERY DELICIOUS,  and juicy.  the steak was so smooth, and the sauce served along made it a memorable foodie experience. On the other hand, service was 10/10. They listened attentively to our feedback and was constantly making sure that all customers were satisfied with their experience. We thought the food to be a bit expensive when we first glanced at the menu, but we left thinking it was worth every penny. Will definitely go back!",

Very clean inside, ambiance is very comforting and the staff was friendly. The person at the till was super helpful with recommendations and I went with all his recommendations.\n\nWhat I ordered:\n* Veggie style Cheese Burger, Single patty (Recommend) $11.50\n* Combo: Fries and a Orange Milkshake (Recommend) $11\n\nThis veggie burger hit all the spots for flavour, their in house sauce laying under fresh tasty veggies and the veggie patty was satisfying, slightly crispy but not greasy in a brioche bun. Highly recommend, the burger was super filling so warning the fries were very tasty as well but it was quite a lot! They fresh cut their fries thin like McDonald's but tastes so much better, crispy, thin and not as greasy. To top off my order I wanted to try their milkshakes. Staff had reco the orange milkshake and what a pleasant surprised that turned out to be! Reminds me of a cream soda orange pop but in a creamy milkshake version! Overall everything was super tasty, I'd recommend taking your order to go if you're making it a combo but the burger itself was good enough. I'd come back to try their vegan burger with the vegan bun. A little pricey here but tastes like fresh ingredients and quality ingredients, so worth the $27 bill with tip.",

This trendy and cozy restaurant specializes in crafting gourmet burgers with a unique twist, and it certainly lived up to its reputation.\n\nFirst and foremost, the ambiance of Bin 4 Burger Lounge was inviting and contemporary. The interior was tastefully decorated with a combination of rustic and modern elements, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The seating arrangements were comfortable, and the staff was attentive and friendly, providing prompt service throughout my visit.\n\nNow let's talk about the star of the show--the burgers. Bin 4 Burger Lounge offers an extensive selection of burgers, each with its own distinct flavor profile. From classic beef burgers to inventive vegetarian options, there is something to satisfy every palate. I opted for their signature \"Bin 4 Burger,\" and it did not disappoint. The patty was juicy, perfectly cooked, and seasoned to perfection. The toppings were fresh, and the brioche bun was soft and complemented the burger beautifully. The portion sizes were generous, ensuring that I left feeling completely satisfied.\n\nIn addition to their impressive burger menu, Bin 4 Burger Lounge also offers a variety of tasty sides and appetizers. Their truffle Parmesan fries were a standout, with a delightful combination of flavors that elevated the dining experience. The restaurant also boasts a selection of craft beers and cocktails to complement the meal, adding another layer of enjoyment.\n\nWhile the overall dining experience at Bin 4 Burger Lounge was excellent, there were a few minor areas where improvements could be made. Firstly, the wait times during peak hours can be a bit long, so it's advisable to make a reservation or plan your visit accordingly. Secondly, the pricing is slightly on the higher side, especially when considering the add-ons and sides. However, the quality of the ingredients and the exceptional flavors justify the price to a large extent.\n\nIn conclusion, Bin 4 Burger Lounge is a must-visit spot for burger enthusiasts in Vancouver. With its inviting atmosphere, flavorful burgers, and attentive service, it delivers a memorable dining experience. While it may be a bit pricey, the quality and taste of the food make it worth the investment. I will definitely be returning to Bin 4 Burger Lounge for another mouthwatering burger adventure in the future.\n\nOur server was Jessi, and he is very friendly and his service was superb.",

They offer a variety of burgers made from chicken, vegan, beef, fish, and bison, with numerous flavors to choose from, and the overall quality of the food was excellent. The seating was comfortable, making it a great place to hang out. They offer a fantastic late-night special after 9 pm, where you can order any burger with fries or salad for only $11, along with a non-alcoholic drink. Excellent servive by the servers.",

They were friendly and both checked in during our meal to ask how things were.\n+ Portion sizes were reasonable.\n\n- Pricey: We ordered the G-Money burger, Cajun burger, a side of fries and a Coke, which came to $42. The G-Money burger was also $17 in-store despite being listed online for $13.\n- Lack of seasoning: The burgers and fries were both very bland because they had absolutely no seasoning. The flavour of the beef and fries could greatly benefit from a little salt and pepper.\n- The cut and texture of the fries were not the most appealing. Also, the fries in our basket were a mix of piping hot and cold.\n- We noticed a lot of gnats flying around while we were eating, which often makes you question cleanliness behind the scenes.\n\nI am not a local, but if I was, I would not be back a second time.",

You can customize your burger, and they never mess it up, plus the great fries. They are just a fav go-to place for a quick burger and fries. The fact that they give you free peanuts in shell and have their potato bags all around the store with the peanut oil which they fry it in just creates an awesome environment. Love the open kitchen and the fact that you can see the fries are cut right there, with skin in different shapes. Just so much better than many fast food chains. I just wish they were open longer hours and had more locations.",

The sheer range of toppings and sauces available ensures that every burger is a unique and personalized experience. The staff's friendly and accommodating nature makes the customization process a breeze.\n\nThe burgers themselves are absolute showstoppers. Juicy, flavorful, and made to perfection, these burgers are a testament to the quality of ingredients used. The melt-in-your-mouth experience is unmatched, and it's evident that a lot of care goes into preparing each burger.\n\nNow, let's talk about the fries - they're more than just a side dish, they're an experience on their own. Crispy on the outside and perfectly tender on the inside, these fries are simply addictive. The fact that they're hand-cut and made fresh right there adds an extra level of deliciousness.\n\nThe ambiance is lively and inviting, adding to the overall enjoyment of the meal. Whether you're a solo diner or with a group of friends, the welcoming atmosphere makes every visit enjoyable.\n\nFor a truly customizable and mouthwatering burger experience paired with some of the best fries around, Five Guys in Vancouver is the place to be.
