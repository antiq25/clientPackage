They need a bit better layout for it. You will almost get run over constantly when going to breakfast\n\nAlso only two of the five days I was there did they have scrambled eggs and bacon, the scrambled eggs are very good. However on days without scrambled eggs they have a \"cheese egg omelet\". That thing sucks. It's dry, heavy and flavorless. They need to stop even making that thing\n\nMost mornings they also have \"breakfast potatoes\" (small potato cubes) they are bland and uninspired, and not fully cooked. One day of my stay they had actual hash browns (the fast food type like at McDonalds).  Those were really, really good. Stick with proper hash browns, holiday inn! The \"breakfast potatoes\" are horrible!\n\nThey usually have some type of sausage-  however, only on one day did they have sausage patties (they always had turkey sausage links, every day). With a sausage patty I was able to make a sandwich with a English muffin. But all other days they only had links, one day they had a pork link and turkey links, so now you couldn't really make a breakfast sandwich. Serving sausage patties gives more options for breakfast and they only did it one day of my stay.\n\nLike other reviewers mentioned, I also experienced problems with my keycard not working , it decided to stop working entirely. They did get it fixed promptly so that was appreciated, but it took me running down the elevator twice and then into the general manager in the hallway to get it fully resolved\n\nThe bed is pretty hard. My bed at home isn't super soft but be aware this bed is hard, your shoulders and hips WILL hurt the first day or so.\n\nThe window blinds are awesome, they are easy to move, and block not only light but sound very effectively.\n\nThe room was fine, I had the King Studio which had a small mini kitchen (hot plate, coffee maker, toaster oven, microwave, utensils)\n\nBathrooms have a vent in the ceiling but no bathroom fan. This seems to be a trend in hotels lately I don't know why\n\nLocation is pretty good it is pretty quiet at night and near the freeway to exit as well as just a mile of two from a large shopping plaza that had coffee shops and a grocery and drug store",

The service here is friendly and efficient.   The room was comfortable and clean.  It checks all of the boxes.   It is not real close to the airport however.  So if you arrive around rush hour or need to get to the airport quickly, it may take a while.  Also I learned too late that you need to call their shuttle.  There are several holiday inns in the area and that can get a little confusing.  If you need a clean and comfortable airport hotel this is a good option.  We'd return.",

It was wonderful to have a hot breakfast included with a good variety of options considering the small dining area. The room was clean and with modernized design. Great place! Negative: The elevator & general lobby area are very small so it can be cramped with a lot of people around but nothing that would ruin the experience.",
