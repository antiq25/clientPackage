After waiting for a very long time she tried to tell me the price of a polyester dog bed was $49.  I told her no because that is a complete rip off.

They had hats on the table and so we tired a couple while we waited. Then this lady rushes over and hovers and asks if we're done. We got up and left to go check out patio umbrellas. My dad was interested in a couple of them and wanted to see how they worked so he cracked the lever, safely and slowly, not causing an hard to anyone or anything, just genuinely wanted to see how it would open, and this same lady RUNS over and tells us we can't be touching things? We could see her watching us everywhere we would go shop and we felt so uncomfortable and it ruined our entire shopping experience. Felt like we were being racially profiled and we were being watched. We weren't doing anything suspicious, we genuinely wanted to shop. My family and I left feeling so unhappy with our entire experience, I don't recommend going there and I don't think we'll be back. The lady had dark complexion and a pony tail in braids. Horrible horrible experience. Ruined my mom's Mother's Day shopping experience as well as ours.",

When I mentioned that the price didn't look right, the employee double checked the screen and said the price was $114.99. I pointed to the sticker on the pants and showed her that it said $104.99. She scanned the sticker with her scanner and said \"the system says it's $114.99, someone must have forgotten to change the sticker\". I mentioned that it should be sold for the advertised price and she said the price was already raised in the system, so that's how much it costs. I told her that I'm not interested in buying it then. These guys are raising prices faster than they can change the stickers and taking advantage of that to rip customers off, hoping they won't notice.
