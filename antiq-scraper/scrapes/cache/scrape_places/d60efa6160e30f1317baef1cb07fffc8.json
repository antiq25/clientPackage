I booked an appointment for our dog to be groomed so she would be out of the house when the movers arrived and the friends she would stay at for 3 days while we moved asked that she be groomed to prevent shedding on their furniture. I woke up on moving day at 6:30 to walk the dog and brush her before her appointment. I showed up on time only to be told the appointment was cancelled because staff called in sick. I wasn't offered any alternative and they wouldn't even let me buy any products in the store because \"it was too early\" even though I saw a bunch of staff in there. I called all the other grooming shops in the area and they are all full for today. Now I have movers showing up and nowhere to put my dog for the day. It's too hot to leave her in the car. And I can't take her to my friend's house for the next couple of days Because she hasn't been groomed as was asked. I work in the service industry and I understand people call in sick. But sometimes you have to buckle down and make it work. A manager might need to step in and pick up some grooming, shears, or else you need to take five minutes off every appointment in the day in order to squeeze in an extra client or else work a little bit later. I'm very disappointed with the lack of sympathy, lack of effort to rectify their own issue. From now on I'll stick to the little guys. They're cheaper anyway.\n\n** update  I couldn't help but call in and talk to the manager. He was kind and offered another appointment on another day as well as a credit. It didn't help us out the day of and would've been nice if they had offered this during the initial visit.\n\n5 stars for the quality of the care/grooming of my pet",

And they often lived in smelly cages (pee soaked bedding) and having only pellets (no nutrients) for food. But this Petsmart in North Vancouver provide their rodents with proper size(bigger) and clean wheels to run on, their beddings are clean, and they even give them a variety of fresh vegetables for snacks alongside pellets! I saw happy and healthy  mice exercising on the wheels and comfortably cuddling with each other today. They were so comfortable with humans(thanks to the kind people who take good care of them) they would come out and curiously sniff us. I'm so happy for the animals to be taken such good care of. Thank you guys so much NV Petsmart! ",

He also waited for us to drive back with our lease agreement documents very close to closing time on a Sunday, and for that we are very grateful. They were working with Action for Animals at the time, and their whole adoption process was very straightforward. Although the profile posted for the public did not go into depth regarding the cats' personalities, they did have folders full of information, advice and recommendations for each of the kitties.\nAside from this, we found the store to be clean and organized, but there were dogs inside barking which made the kittens quite jumpy and scared at times. Also, the cat enclosure did not have a climbing or scratching tower (which most PetSmarts do), so we believe that would be a great addition for the kitties enrichment.",

I have been shopping at this store for quite a long time. Last week, I found out a problem at the Main Street  store in North Vancouver. I bought over 20 feeding fishes with my wife and they were on sale. When I paid, a young cashier seems didn't know what kind of fish I bought.  So I told him they were Rosy Red Minnow which was $0.40 each. I also showed him their discount label on my phone.  The discount label said buy 5 save 25% on all fish. The cashier ignored what the label said.  He charged me $0.45 per fish instead of $0.40 per fish.  Then gave me 15% discount but not 25% discount.  Both the charges and discount were not right. My wife told the cashier about the problem and he told us the price he input was correct.  He didn't want to look at my wife and he looked unhappy on what we said from his behavior. Not sure if we are not caucasian. I told my wife to solve the problem later with the Manager. I found the manager and told her about the issue. She made the correction on the charges and gave me the refund. But I forgot to tell her this was not the first time I was charged for the wrong price. I will keep an eye on the receipts as I don't want to overpay if I shouldn't be. Nobody want to lose money on the high value items. Good Luck!",

Although I never used their service, but hard to miss that they also have grooming and training facilities. For the clothes, I found not too many choices, but for food and treats they have quite a lot options to choose. Installing their phone apps is worth it, where we can find promotion info, check stock availability, online shop, book appointment for services, etc.\n\nFor Petsmart, keep up the good job!",

This happened yesterday, at around 8 on August 19th. the employee was quite old and was a male with not much hair. if the manager or any worker is seeing this, please it would be very appreciated if you could talk to him or give him a warning as this type of behaviour is unacceptable as his job is to help customers, not accuse and shame.",

The treatment of the fish is very simply, inexcusable, and the standard of care fails to meet any humane criteria. In many of the tanks, particularly the smaller species such as guppies and tetras, bodies were littering the gravel floor, decorating the waters surface. They were in there for so long, a milky surface had formed on the surface, and white mold surrounded them. Some bodies simply decomposed, the skeleton visible.\nIn the aquatic fauna section, the leaves that remained either were yellowed and melting away. Some had tiny white dots, a possible sign of disease? There was only one row that was healthy.\n\nI am both horrified and disappointed by Petsmart's treatment of their animals and encourage other buyers to think twice before supporting a business which does not prioritize the wellbeing of animals.",

Instead I was told to book an appointment with a vet or another groomer so they could safely finish my poor boys half trimmed body. I was a little bit in shock as I carried him out to my car with big patches of hair falling off of him. There was no clean up or anything. They just stopped shaving halfway through and essentially gave up.
