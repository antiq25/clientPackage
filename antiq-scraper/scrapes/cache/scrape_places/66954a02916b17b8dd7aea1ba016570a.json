Shouldn't I expect it?\n\nI usually receive some radish with my order, even in a small quantity, as a complimentary addition. I wasn't seeking a large amount, just its presence, which was absent.\n\nRegarding the tacos, they were mediocre at best. The tortilla wasn't freshly made, and the quality of the beef was subpar. Considering the price, I don't believe it's a fair deal. Despite trying many taco restaurants, I might not recommend Taco 'N Todo.\n\nI'm not seeking a refund; my aim is to provide an integrity review for the owner's benefit. I thought the owner could understand the issues from the pictures, but it seems that wasn't the case, which is a bit disappointing.\n\nLast but not least: Is it typical to use just one layer of tortilla in a taco?

The price of our Meal (4 tacos) Beef and chicken those that you have chosen is $15.00 (which is even cheaper than other stores) however if you consider this price expensive, sorry about that, we offer great quality and fresh food...I wont sacrificed quality for quantity. Btw Thank you for your tip, that's why you paid $18.00. If you would like a refund of your tip, please just go for it. Thank you.  Have a great day. Gracias. Monica Owner",
