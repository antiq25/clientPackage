Then I find out that they gave SOMEONE ELSE our order without double checking the other person's receipt on whether or not it was the correct order. Then after asking them 5 times to make ours they only give us 17 nuggets, 2 honey sauce, spicy habanero sauce, and did not take out the onions from the burger. Also did not receive our root beer and the staff would just ignore us when we would ask politely. My friend is deathly allergic to onions too so she wasn't able to have her burger. I understand it was crowded but that is no way to go about our order. Horrible customer service and I'm very disappointed by this location. They also refused us a refund for not giving us our full order. Terrible place and I will never come back here.",

Here's a balanced review highlighting the key points:\n\nPositive:\nMenu Variety - McDonald's offers a diverse menu with plenty of options. Whether it was classic favourites or new additions, there were choices to suit different preferences and dietary restrictions.\n\nNegative:\nSlow Service - This particular McDonald's service could have been faster. It took longer than expected to place my order and receive my food. Improved efficiency during peak hours would enhance the overall dining experience.\n\nNegative:\nAtmosphere Concerns - The atmosphere of the restaurant fell short of expectations. The seating area appeared unclean, and the floors were scattered with food and drink spills. This lack of cleanliness created an unhealthy and uninviting environment.\n\nPositive:\nFamiliarity and Convenience - McDonald's consistency in its menu and service can be comforting for customers seeking a familiar dining experience. Additionally, its convenient locations make it easily accessible for a quick meal.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to McDonald's in Vancouver had ups and downs. While the menu variety and familiarity were positive, the slow service and cleanliness issues detracted from the overall experience. I hope the management takes note of these concerns and takes steps to improve service efficiency and maintain a cleaner and more inviting environment for customers.",

Had to go to washroom first as I have some health issues and needed to wash my hands before I eat. As normally ppl should. Staff didn't want to let me in with an excuse that the maintenance is in progress. No one was doing maintenance they just simply decided to close to the washroom for the night. This kind of behaviour should be illegal as it is a restaurant and restaurant bylaw says clearly you need to provide washroom when ppl eat in. Hope they will not behave like this towards anyone else in the future. Managers name that night was Jenny. Hope the top management will sort this out. I will visit again to see if the behaviour towards customers improved. Then will revisit my review.",

I chose to walk in but I regret, there were about 30 people starring at the order monitor but there were no order number at all.  After close to 40 minutes waiting for my 2 meals with 2 fries no salt, end up I got salt all over my hand and the food I got was cold.  Asked to change the hot fries with no salt and complained I had been waiting for my food over 30 mins.  The manager gave an attitude, \"it is not my problem, we were busy\", I said \"so is that my problem? you are the manager on duty and not responsible the human power?\"  She turned around and shout \"it's not my problem, give her something hot\".  I am patience enough to wait more than 30 mins for FAST FOOD and I deserve to receive this kind of \"Customer service\"????  The manager was trying to hide when I was taking her picture for evidence.  And other manager on duty was trying to cover her and asked me am I using human right.  There is nothing to do with human right but I was not treated right.  I brought it up to McDonald Headquarter about the incident I experienced at this location and asked for refund coz I threw them away.  The headquarter told me this restaurant manager would contact me within 10 business days but I never receive any phone call or email.  I received 2 meal coupons from Headquarter as a refund.  I will never ever come back again.  P.S. This restaurant is always full of garbage everywhere and no one was doing cleaning.",

I take a bite and it tastes fine.  Then I take my first sip of coffee and that tastes off.  I'm hungry so I eat my food.....

Coming to all chain quite often and no noticeable smell, but this place has specific smell. Service friendly and supportive, thanks to the staff. Automatic order Machine working fine, order TV screen working as supposed to be.\nI think if you're comparing to Alberta all McDonald's in BC working great - I'm still shocked.\nIf you'll find source of smell and reduce it, big improvement guaranteed. Good place for getting your fast food.\npc: for those using app, large iced coffee offer is just 1$.",

Coming to all chain quite often and no noticeable smell, but this place has specific smell. Service friendly and supportive, thanks to the staff. Automatic order Machine working fine, order TV screen working as supposed to be.\nI think if you're comparing to Alberta all McDonald's in BC working great - I'm still shocked.\nIf you'll find source of smell and reduce it, big improvement guaranteed. Good place for getting your fast food.\npc: for those using app, large iced coffee offer is just 1$.",

The lady waiting for her meal had to ask for it to be served to her and reminded twice she also had a coffee.  Maybe the staff person hadnt woken up yet.\n\nAsked for parking to be validated.and found out when I went to the kiosk that it hadnt been.  Not impressed with my experience.",

Due to the heavy weight, the tray broke in half and the 4 coffees spilled on the ground. The young lady asked the manager if she could get a replacement and have someone to clean up the floor. However....the manager said back to her \"can you get the mop from the washroom and clean it up yourself?\" The young lady was stunned and overwhelmed that the manager actually told her to go clean up the mess. The manager continues to say that \"in here, whoever makes the mess gotta clean up themselves.\" The young lady was also shocked and said \" excuse me, but what?\" Seeing the customer unsatisfied, the manager said \"okay, you can clean it up and I will tell someone (a worker) to help you.\"  This left me speech, I have never seen customer service like this anywhere else.

Well, I stopped by after 30 mins on my way to somewhere else, when I got to the place, the manager said the burger will be cooked. By far everything sounds acceptable. The funny part is I waited at the pickup stand for 15 mins without anyone gave me the burger. I saw the burger was there , no one helps. After I asked serval times for the burger, it was not warm.

I called the restaurant, the manager said I need to drive back for the burger, there is no way to refund it. Well, I stopped by after 30 mins on my way to somewhere else, when I got to the place, the manager said the burger will be cooked. By far everything sounds acceptable. The funny part is I waited at the pickup stand for 15 mins without anyone gave me the burger. I saw the burger was there , no one helps. After I asked serval times for the burger, it was not warm. Totally no customer service. Lucky them get a good location for no other choices. Avoid it if you can.",

This McDonald's does have great quality food.\n\nThe staff however were really stressed and seemed like they needed more support.

The taste and quality of their food consistently great.The atmosphere is pretty chill, whether I'm grabbing a quick bite or hanging out with friends. It's got that classic McDonald's vibe that's both nostalgic.\n\nNow, when it comes to service, it's a bit of slow. Sometimes things run smoothly and the staff is friendly, but there have been a few instances where I've encountered slow service or slight mistakes in my order.

The taste and quality of their food consistently great.The atmosphere is pretty chill, whether I'm grabbing a quick bite or hanging out with friends. It's got that classic McDonald's vibe that's both nostalgic.\n\nNow, when it comes to service, it's a bit of slow. Sometimes things run smoothly and the staff is friendly, but there have been a few instances where I've encountered slow service or slight mistakes in my order. That's why I'm giving it a 3-star rating for service.\n\nMcDonald's still gets a thumbs up from me.

She was the one keeping everybody busy chatting with everyone and like 10 years old kid screaming while laughing. I got upset and left the store.\nI didn't order, the other gentleman did the same.

Second, Since it was about $80 worth of food, we had to wait, which we did not mind at all. We got all our food but when we arrived home and checked, the amount of fries and ice cream they gave us were at least 2/3 full, unlike their other locations where its to the rim! to make it worst, fries in the bag were not placed right way up, so, obviously, the fries went all over! Told some of my friends regarding this incident and they all had the same incident and told me they would never go back to this location. I may be on the same boat with them now.\n\nNOTE: Pictures only show a part of the order.",
