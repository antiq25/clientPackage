Staff is always helpful and informative. You can buy in bulk or small amount depends on the product. If you don't live closeby then better phone them first, sometimes they may be closed and you may not know.\n\nSince they are wholesaler, they don't have any store front and don't expect beautiful decorated store, so for first time visitors it will be difficult to find where it is located. It is behind the strip mall area on Marine drive. You can enter the store's back side through Argyle st. There aren't any signs, right after entering Argyle turn left and keep driving all the way to the end, you'll notice a small sign on a back door saying h&b poultry.
