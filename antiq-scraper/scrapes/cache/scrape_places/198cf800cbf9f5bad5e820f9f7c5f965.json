Had to go to washroom first as I have some health issues and needed to wash my hands before I eat. As normally ppl should. Staff didn't want to let me in with an excuse that the maintenance is in progress. No one was doing maintenance they just simply decided to close to the washroom for the night. This kind of behaviour should be illegal as it is a restaurant and restaurant bylaw says clearly you need to provide washroom when ppl eat in. Hope they will not behave like this towards anyone else in the future. Managers name that night was Jenny. Hope the top management will sort this out. I will visit again to see if the behaviour towards customers improved. Then will revisit my review.",

Then I find out that they gave SOMEONE ELSE our order without double checking the other person's receipt on whether or not it was the correct order. Then after asking them 5 times to make ours they only give us 17 nuggets, 2 honey sauce, spicy habanero sauce, and did not take out the onions from the burger. Also did not receive our root beer and the staff would just ignore us when we would ask politely. My friend is deathly allergic to onions too so she wasn't able to have her burger. I understand it was crowded but that is no way to go about our order. Horrible customer service and I'm very disappointed by this location.

It looked really gross and another thing was it felt like it was in the freezer and it was defrosting and they gave it to me. It looks like a disaster. It was so disgusting looking at it. I ended up throwing it out into the bush for the birds to eat and I feel bad for them and my coffee. I just dumped it out and just went over to Tim Hortons after and I actually got a hot coffee and a really nice muffin way to go McDonald's anyways everybody have a wonderful day thank you for taking the time to read this",

And when you refuse to be parked you get even worse service because now you are going against the normal, it's a drive thru and I should have to pull over and wait. While I sat and waited for my order 6 to 7 vehicles were parked so they can make their time for drive thru.  Truly terrible management for thinking this is acceptable to treat customers like this.\n\nAfter receiving my order my fry level is laughable. Ordered junior McChicken extra mayo and received my mcchicken with no mayo\n\nHow do you mess that up.\nCompletely unacceptable.\n\nCorporate McDonald's needs to review this location and it's management for customer service and drive thru operations.",

Compared to others, yes needs better management I don't go here often but every time I do it's much slower than others. Last time they told me to park my car for 2 cheeseburgers. I said no its fine. I don't mind waiting here, I said nicely. I rolled up my window and sat there on my phone. They had a long line in drive through. My burgers came within 30 seconds.

If ONE person has bad service it can spread, possibly this someone who has been there a long time with seniority? I do believe it can trickle down. Well if he's being lazy then I'm being lazy.

Compared to others, yes needs better management I don't go here often but every time I do it's much slower than others. Last time they told me to park my car for 2 cheeseburgers. I said no its fine. I don't mind waiting here, I said nicely. I rolled up my window and sat there on my phone. They had a long line in drive through. My burgers came within 30 seconds.

This makes no sense to me I've never been to a restaurant where you're willing to pay for a product and they say no to you especially if it's just WATER. Especially when you're spending 30 to $40 each time just for two people you would expect better service. I hope management gets involved in actually makes a difference and teaches these people customer service it seems that customer service has gone down the drain. The employees act annoyed to serve you. It's super sad. I miss the good old days of good customer service. Not a Karen just want basic customer service.",

Whether it was classic favourites or new additions, there were choices to suit different preferences and dietary restrictions.\n\nNegative:\nSlow Service - This particular McDonald's service could have been faster. It took longer than expected to place my order and receive my food. Improved efficiency during peak hours would enhance the overall dining experience.\n\nNegative:\nAtmosphere Concerns - The atmosphere of the restaurant fell short of expectations. The seating area appeared unclean, and the floors were scattered with food and drink spills. This lack of cleanliness created an unhealthy and uninviting environment.\n\nPositive:\nFamiliarity and Convenience - McDonald's consistency in its menu and service can be comforting for customers seeking a familiar dining experience. Additionally, its convenient locations make it easily accessible for a quick meal.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to McDonald's in Vancouver had ups and downs. While the menu variety and familiarity were positive, the slow service and cleanliness issues detracted from the overall experience. I hope the management takes note of these concerns and takes steps to improve service efficiency and maintain a cleaner and more inviting environment for customers.",

I am patience enough to wait more than 30 mins for FAST FOOD and I deserve to receive this kind of \"Customer service\"????  The manager was trying to hide when I was taking her picture for evidence.  And other manager on duty was trying to cover her and asked me am I using human right.  There is nothing to do with human right but I was not treated right.  I brought it up to McDonald Headquarter about the incident I experienced at this location and asked for refund coz I threw them away.  The headquarter told me this restaurant manager would contact me within 10 business days but I never receive any phone call or email.  I received 2 meal coupons from Headquarter as a refund.  I will never ever come back again.  P.S. This restaurant is always full of garbage everywhere and no one was doing cleaning.",

This was a nice surprise!\n\nThe floor was very dirty with food wrappers, napkins, and cups on the floor all over the place. This was also a surprise, but not nice.\n\nThere was no ice in the drink machine and no napkins available.\n\nThe staff was slow and the service was minimal.",

I take out the food and proceed to open up my burritos to add salsa inside.  Right away I noticed that the wrap seems soggy, I open it and the eggs and meat inside look wet.  I take a bite and it tastes fine.  Then I take my first sip of coffee and that tastes off.  I'm hungry so I eat my food.....  Then in around a half hour I start to feel light headed and sick to my stomach.  Then 15-20 minutes later I find myself puking and sitting on the toilet for a while.  It's now 8 hours later and my stomach has still been a mess.  No idea what happened, I've had this same breakfast so many times and it's never done this to me, so I guess I'm posting this to say if it looks or tastes off don't eat the food.",

If there are 2 screens, they should have 2 people inside working drive thru. Finally got my food ordered ($15 worth of food), paid, and when I got to the pickup window I was handed my 2 drinks and was told to wait in the reserved stall for my food. It took another 6 minutes to get my food brought to my car. To wait 10 minutes for such little food in a drive thru is absurd.",

No one wants to touch the handle after washing your hands it is not sanitary and no napkings are still not provided at Mcdonalds no 2 . LEAVE A LIKE IF YOU AGREE. This NO 2 Mcdonalds makes the absolute worst fries of any mcdonalds ive been to, always undercooked or overcoooked, never fresh taste stale, clearly the staff cooks alot of fries at once and does not throw out after the designated time and also is not cooking the correct time consistently i constantly get like 10 of the fries extremely soft undercooked or a few black burnt. Also they short you on fries . Large fries always is never full to top aswell as medium!  The Oreo mcfleury never has enough icecream,  oreo or amount of extras, burgers are usually cooked well but sometimes after 6pm or night especially quarter pounder, cheeseburgers etc it is undercooked or has no taste.  Breakfast they do well, hashbrowns always fresh however ive notice sausage and egg bread is sometimes burned black or hard maybe adjust the toaster?? The coffee never taste really good i usually get 2 cream one sugar and it taste like nothing. The bathroom is a horrible, extremely heavy door with no automatic button!  literally everyone is touching the same handle to get in and out, disgusting!!  a foot handle would make the difference and is much needed or replace the door you make enough money common guys, or automated door... or at the very least leave paper towel so staff and visitors can at least grab door with handle and throw in a nearby garbage like every other store!!!  so not every is touching the same thing, disgusting to think staff touch that then go make your food and visitors touch that when leaving bathroom and go eat there food. Serious  health concern! Or if all that is too expensive leave the door open during shifts with a piece of wood or something under it.  Also Only one toilet  in such a huge restaurant bathroom?? Needs a major renovation. Been like this for atlest 10 years. On a positive note staff are friendly and do work fast. Hope they put some papertowel in bathroom to grab when leaving the bathroom soon, or leave mens door open so you dont have to touch that handle and open that heavy door! Or make it automatic like the main entrance door which is very nice. ALSO been told at drivethrough the park on side and no one was even waiting behind me?? Had 2 items. Why have drive through if u make us wait? Seen others make this point to. Hope this review makes a difference. Leave a like if you agree with my points.\n\nSUMMARY\nPls improve! Manager owner. We understand that new people are hired everyday but other Mcdonalds do not have this problem, have them trained properly.\n\nCOOK FRIES PROPERLY WITH PROPER AMOUNT OF FRIES GIVEN CONSISTENLY WITH SALT! cook burgers so they are well done lil burn on em not under cooked with proper seasoning. Dont burn buns on breakfast sausage and egg.\n\nFIX BATHROOM PLS, offer paper towels to use to exit after washing hands and put garbage near to throw away, not just hand drier as everyone touches same handle and alot of people do not wash there hands!  or leave door open permanently with a wood stopper, or add automatic sensor to open door or replace door. Add another toilet, one toilet for a 60 seating restaurant is not enough. Renovate bathroom.\n\nDo not tell drivers to park on side when it is not busy. We go to drivethroughs cuz we are in a hurry. Add more staff to night shift food is always cold and not fresh especially fries and wait times are up to 40 min. HIRE MORE STAFF FOR NIGHT SHIFT.\n\nOreo mcfleury fill to top with ice cream and use more oreo or smarties etc not giving enough quantity .\n\nImprove coffee. Make sure to put what we order. 2 creams and 1 sugar, shouldnt taste like no sugar or no cream.\n\nThanks for listening and hope to see improvements in the coming week! Thank you staff and managers!",

She looked at me like \"who cares\" and her other staff ignored me again. I had to basically tell them to open the door and  when I told Mindy she was rude she started arguing with me and talking to me as if we were in a brawl. Completely unprofessional for a \"manager\" to act this way! She argued with me and even customers were shaking their head at what she was doing. When someone needs to use the bathroom it should not matter what the reason is. I did not need to explain to her that my mother is handicap and is unable to go up the stairs. I have never been to this location but I do have to say it's one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Mindy needs management skills training. Horrible experience! The best part is when you complain to their upper management they always say \"will look into it\" and nothing gets fixed or done. Upper management will read this and do absolutely nothing and continue on because that's what McDonald's management do \"nothing\".",

She looked at me like \"who cares\" and her other staff ignored me again. I had to basically tell them to open the door and  when I told Mindy she was rude she started arguing with me and talking to me as if we were in a brawl. Completely unprofessional for a \"manager\" to act this way! She argued with me and even customers were shaking their head at what she was doing. When someone needs to use the bathroom it should not matter what the reason is. I did not need to explain to her that my mother is handicap and is unable to go up the stairs. I have never been to this location but I do have to say it's one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Mindy needs management skills training. Horrible experience! The best part is when you complain to their upper management they always say \"will look into it\" and nothing gets fixed or done. Upper management will read this and do absolutely nothing and continue on because that's what McDonald's management do \"nothing\".",

But they didnt make it in 2 min, I asked for the refund right away. But the manager was soooo slow, didnt try to help me, repeating excuses and so rude!!!!\nEventually, I missed the ferry and had to waste 30 min:) thank you guys!",

When my son talked to the staff asking him to top up the large cup, he grabbed the two smoothies (one large and one medium size), and pour the smoothie out from the medium cup to the large cup to top up the large smoothie! What kind of attitude is that? We are not beggar who ask for free food but have paid full price for what we are entitled to receive from the merchant! When the staff passed the \"adjusted\" smoothies back to us, the female staff who was standing next to the Asian young staff who was dealing with our request looked surprised by what the Asian staff had done to the cups. This is a terrible customer service experience that we ever experienced at McDonald's. We will never come here again unless the team manager look into this and take appropriate action to a better training to their team! They need to know what is the proper amount of each food items and know what is a proper and respectful way to deal with their customers!",

I'm pregnant so it's not too ideal to weave around the picnic tables even though it was good sun outside.\n\nbought mcflurry kitkat but it wasn't mixed properly at all. it wasn't mixed halfway to the bottom. so that one was sad. and it had a big hole in the middle so i was basically getting half of what i paid for\n\nbought fries as well, nothing new. greasy but that's what fries are unfortunately.\n\ngood for a stop over place before heading out to walk at the seawall for sure.",

I'm pregnant so it's not too ideal to weave around the picnic tables even though it was good sun outside.\n\nbought mcflurry kitkat but it wasn't mixed properly at all. it wasn't mixed halfway to the bottom. so that one was sad. and it had a big hole in the middle so i was basically getting half of what i paid for\n\nbought fries as well, nothing new. greasy but that's what fries are unfortunately.\n\ngood for a stop over place before heading out to walk at the seawall for sure.",
