Sadly that's not the case. No Jump Scares. Well lit houses with \"actors\" doing their best to scare you.\n\nHaunted houses are lame. The ride wait times are long and only decent if you're willing to pay an extra $70 for a Rapid Pass.\nWoke up this morning to see if I was the only one that thought this way and read a trip advisor review from 10 yeads ago with the exact same experience.\n\nThis is supposed to be for 13 years of age and up, but its more like 5 to 10 years old.\n\nNot for adults.",

A lot of food options though and it is fun. I recommend going at a off peak time.\n\nI am not going to compare to Disneyland but it can be underwhelming, amusement park wise, but for the variety of experience, it is fun to go once a year.\n\nExpect to be faced with double triple price for food though! I tried to take some vendors pictures so you can know what to expect before going.\n\nBe aware, there can be concerts or shows not appropriate for kids of any age. There has been drag queen show, and etc.\n\nMy #1 recommendation here is Superdog show! They are so fun!! Video attached!",
