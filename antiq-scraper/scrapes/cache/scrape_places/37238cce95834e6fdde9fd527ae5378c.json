Still drank it all, but probably wouldn't get it again...\n\nOther than that, the decor was nice and clean and the atmosphere was quiet and serene. Also, it's a little on the expensive side... so definitely more of an experience than a regular hang-out spot.

The cake was refreshing and smooth with crunchy chocolate bites. The lavender flavour in the drink was strong, and I liked that it wasn't overpowered by the blueberry. The plastic cake cylinder snaps onto the drink lid for easy transport. The shop is clean with cute decor. It's a tad pricey so not your everyday treat, but they have unique flavours that warrant a trip back.",

She told me about certain exercises that I should do to strengthen & stretching my glutes & hamstrings, as I wasn't in good shape to play golf. Doc said it'd take 6-12 weeks, but I played my first golf 5 weeks after injury and I played better because I was more stronger in my core and glutes. I'm still getting treatments b'c of sore left shoulder & back and she's used shock therapy for shoulder and it has rapidly helped the shoulder. My back pain is also getting better. 6 weeks later now, I'm playing golf better & I can run if I have to, btw, I'm a newish senior. I'm planning to check in with Krishna from time to time if I feel aches & pains. Thanks much, Krishna!",

The food was delicious, the portions were generous, and the restaurant was more than happy to accommodate a few of our guests who had dietary restrictions. The service was fast, and the communication with us was incredible. So many of our guests also complimented the excellent service they received during our reception, and we had so many compliments about the beautiful view of Vancouver as well. The servers even went out of their way to ensure that we, the bride and groom, were comfortable and well taken care of during the entire brunch. Even the preplanning was smooth and seamless, and communicating back and forth with Makda about wedding details was an easy process. Many of our guests have commented that this was one of the best weddings they've been to, and we could not have done it without all the wonderful help provided by Seasons. As a wedding venue, we highly recommend Seasons in the Park! Plus, we felt compared to other wedding venues, that Seasons was quite reasonable, and who can beat that beautiful view of Vancouver, and wonderful setting within Queen Elizabeth Park. Thank you very much Seasons for making our special day so wonderful!",

The cake was quite substantial and rich.  The creme brulee had hints of citrus in it.\n\nThe mushroom soup was lacking a bit tho.  A bit bland, had to add some more salt and pepper to it myself but couldn't really help it.\n\nService was very good and the views are amazing on the patio.",

To be honest with you I've probably visited about 9 store before I came to this one and she was the nicest out of all those other bridal stores. I actually was eyeing another dress online and they didn't have it in stock to try. Hrissa, took the time to show me on a mannequin how the dress might look on me. Because she is a designer as well, she gave me a lot of insight on dresses that would look good on my body. While I didn't find my dress this visit with her, she gave me a lot of pointers on what to look for in the future.\n\nAlso the dresses she designs herself are just gorgeous, definitely visit this spot (very boho/New York fashion week!)! Her designs are just soooo dreamyyy ",

Everyone at the gym was kind and helpful especially my lovely trainer, Rachel. Rachel was tough at times, I used to call her evil, and very caring and attentive on the days I was feeling down. I enjoyed training with Rachel, I enjoyed the music she used to play for my sessions and I was very happy with the transformation I saw on my body after only 2 months of training. Also, I appreciate how Rachel was very understanding of my busy schedule and how she used to push me to keep coming to the sessions regularly. I am very happy with the results I achieved in the 6 months of training with Rachel and I would've continued working with her if I didn't have to move out of town. All the best Rachel :)",

I went from almost 130lbs of \"skinny fat\" to 114lbs of muscle. He has helped me obtain the physique I've always wanted and the strength I never knew that I had. He's incredibly attentive, knowledgeable, and an overall genuine trainer and boxing coach.  His positive attitude and approachable nature makes me feel completely at ease. I cannot recommend David enough as he truly knows what he is doing and you will see how he genuinely cares about your goals. He radiates passion and dedication for his clients and I absolutely love training with him. He will make you succeed with your fitness goals. If you're seeking a trainer who will produce results and make you enjoy it at the same time - you have found the right place. My only regret is not starting with him sooner. I am so incredibly happy - Thank you David and the amazing Blk Box Team ",

Trying to cancel an appointment is nearly impossible - they expect you to notify them 24 hours ahead to cancel your appointment otherwise will charge you a fee, but when you go to cancel online the online booking says unable to cancel due to being <48hrs and to call the clinic to cancel? Then if you try calling, they don't answer their phone because their hours to pick up the phone is 9-12? Because of covid?? They are always rude whenever I tried booking or calling about anything. I had to get a form filled out by my doctor which she was willing to do as it was healthcare work related, then when I call the office the receptionist doesn't allow me to speak to her or let me get the form filled unless I pay 40$? After speaking with my doctor directly she didn't even mention a charge being needed. They seriously need to rethink how they deliver patient centred care as their clinic is far from that.",

Sadly, this was a huge mistake on our part. We took our cat in for her annual checkup. All of the documents were transferred from our previous vet to this one, so it should have her up to date vaccine information and other health background. Unfortunately, Dr. Shura didn't even pay attention to her vaccination history anyways, and despite our cat having gotten her 3-year vaccines in 2018, he said it was done in 2017 and then vaccinated her anyways. I didn't notice this until I got home and saw my previous invoices from the previous vet that said she last got the vaccination in 2018. A few days after we got home from the vet, my cat's hair started falling out in the area where the vaccination was injected. We tried calling Vancouver East Veterinary Walk-In Clinic on Wednesday at around 10AM and there was no pick-up (they are closed most of the week, open only for limited hours in the afternoon), no voice mail, and no emergency line you can call. We ended up having to drive back to our old vet to get her looked at because that was our only option. I understand that adverse side effect may happen after a vaccination, but I am very disappointed that the vet misread her vaccination history and gave her something she didn't need, and also we weren't able to reach them or an alternate number. When we were getting our cat looked at, Mr. Shura said to us that he doesn't like to overvaccinate animals because he'll get our money through teeth cleanings anyways (he had recommended a teeth cleaning for our cat). I couldn't tell if he was a vet or a used car salesman.",

Operates Monday to Friday. Lovely and professional staff who remain patient, helpful and composed during this unusually difficult time.\n\nOur family is seen and treated by Dr Vasquez who has brilliant reviews on Rate My MD (not at all surprising). We have also seen Dr Cubra on occasion when Dr Vasquez has been away. Both doctors are incredibly patient, empathetic, and knowledgeable with relationships to other fantastic specialists in the community.\n\nDr Vasquez is hardly ever late for an appointment - sometimes he is a few minutes early. On the rare occasion I have waited an additional 5-10 minutes but this is a far departure from our previous GP. I can't believe had become accustomed to\nwaiting 1 hour + elsewhere.\n\nWhen this clinic moved into our neighbourhood a few years ago, I happened to ask the receptionist which doctor I should see and they told me that ALL of them were amazing. We have happily found this to be true!",

I never feel rushed and he always takes the time to listen to my symptoms and explain his recommendations. I truly believe he goes above and beyond for all the patients he sees. He has been an extremely huge help (especially this year) for me and I am so thankful for him and this clinic. The team at this clinic...they are the best!\n\n- I have never felt I had to wait an unreasonable amount of time, which is amazing for a walk-in clinic.

Nikki briefly spoke of how some of these cats as well as dogs,  had been treated prior to her stepping in and rescuing them and about how the pandemic and natural disasters have increased the poor faith of these vulnerable animals.  She really cares for animals.  She is defiantly a cat lady through and through. The work she does for these animals is incredible. I don't know what will happen to all the animals in the b.c in distress when she retires. Although I can't see her retiring bc she cares too much about animals being treated badly. Weather it be an issue of hoarding, owners on substances and or natural disasters. As well as her program for seniors she is right on it. We often get caught up in our busy lives and  forget about animals and there well being.  If you can't adopt a cat from Nikki please consider sponsoring a cat or make a donation. I'm not sure if she excepts blankets and towels but that could be an idea as well.",

The room was very small and cramped, I'm not sure if the podiatrist has their own office. Because the office was small, the equipment seemed a bit disorganized. The procedure seemed to be done okay, the incisions seemed straight and I think the phenol was applied, but the ingrown toenail has returned. Everything about the experience was mediocre, and now I have to get the procedure done again anyway somewhere else.",

There was a lovely little zing from the banana peppers in the background, but it was not overwhelming. It was too much food for me, so I offered some to my team coworkers, and their response was that it was very good, indeed. One of my coworkers had a second piece, and it was only a small pizza to begin with. Definitely a spectacular choice for pizza, so check it out!",

One niece told me it was bit spicy, but everyone else liked it. The deal was unbeatable. Bread sticks were good too. I wish they had extra amount of wings in stock. Food was pretty memorable.

Bruce is very personable and detailed with his communication- I knew exactly what I was paying for. Every spot in the apartment was up to expectations and the equipment/products used were also of great quality. Additionally, because both my husband and I work from home, I was very happy that it only takes 45 minutes since they send a team of 4. Very great company to work with when you want consistent and efficient communication and quality of work! Looking forward to continuing using The Maids of Vancouver :)",

If our patients are unable to make it to the time they booked, they are welcome to call in and adjust their appointment 24 hours before their booked time. If our patients have an emergency or a legitimate reason, we usually waive the no show fee and end with a warning. Phone appointments are just as important as in-person appointments, which is why there is a no show fee for phone calls as well. If you still have any questions or concerns, please email us at info@forwardcaremedical.com and we will assist you the best of our abilities.\n\nThank you,\nFCM",

Too business type of services instead of a \"caring practice\".\nNo more than  2 questions allowed to ask  even if you have not seen them for so long!\nThe office is so crowded like a zoo!  I was put on hold with that terrible ding ding music every single call & you will be told that the next appointment will be a week later! I feel sorry for those sick elderly patients if they need quick assistance! Even worst is when the elderly don't even know how to book the appointment online! Terrible office management with too many doctors working for Dr Amanda Lau, the boss, who only works 2 days a week, few hours a day. Expecting the patients to accommodate her schedules so I requested to switch to one of her staff doctors but no spaces were reserved for us, the loyal patients!

Too business type of services instead of a \"caring practice\".\nNo more than  2 questions allowed to ask  even if you have not seen them for so long!\nThe office is so crowded like a zoo!  I was put on hold with that terrible ding ding music every single call & you will be told that the next appointment will be a week later! I feel sorry for those sick elderly patients if they need quick assistance! Even worst is when the elderly don't even know how to book the appointment online! Terrible office management with too many doctors working for Dr Amanda Lau, the boss, who only works 2 days a week, few hours a day. Expecting the patients to accommodate her schedules so I requested to switch to one of her staff doctors but no spaces were reserved for us, the loyal patients! I will never come back to this office again!",

Unfortunately, we can only limit our patients to one or two concerns per appointment as there is a time restraint. If we allow our patients to go over the 10 minute limit, other patients would not be able to have their appointment on time. We do however encourage our patients to book multiple appointments if they have more concerns to discuss with our doctors.\n\nIf our patients require quick assistance, we do sometimes allow urgent same-day bookings. If you have any questions or concerns, please email us at info@forwardcaremedical.com and we will help you in the best way we can.\n\nThank you,\nFCM",

It started with busstops, billboards, note pads... then one day I was driving down Kingsway and bam!!  right beside me is a 4 foot image on a car of Brandon! I went home and told my wife I think I found our realtor. I called Brandon and he came to our current home at the time and gave us a breakdown on market/value. He is very well spoken , confident , handsome young man and has his finger on the heartbeat of the market so we decided to list. We listed aggressively as he suggested and this fetched us multiple offers with our property going 80k over asking!! What a beauty! This was only one experience with Brandon. The second experience is a single family home in Montecito burnaby. I had fully renovated. Brandon showed up and fell in love with the place. I told Brandon \"do you think we can get $2.5\" we had purchased 1.5 years prior for $1.840 he said yeah l let's try! I believed that if anyone could fetch this number it would be him. Brandon had beautiful photos taken, drone shots, and a walk through video featuring,  yes! The one and only Brandon Gee Moore!! Brandon got us the number we wanted yet again for another huge win. Now we had sold and we did not have a house to move to only a pocket full of cash. This is great but not when you have a pregnant wife and two other kids! He worked day and night until he found us our dream property. No wonder this guy is top 1% . If you can say Brandon you can say SOLD!",

With people who have a large area or full scalp correction ( like yourself having alopecia) I want to give you / all my clients a high quality result and a quality SMP session. So I need 1 day free before your session and 1 day free after. I do this to keep my wrists fully rested and healed for each client. Most company's take on multiple clients in a day and they have you on a time clock. When they do this they just spread out your smp Pigmenting and keep asking you to come back in for more sessions(sometimes 4 to 6 sessions). But with my business, I want to try my best to get everyone done in 2 sessions. (90%) of my clients are done in 2 sessions. Because I take my time and again only take on 1 client in a day or every other day when doing large sessions. So you have me at my best rested self. I'm all about quality over quantity. I don't think its fair if I took multiple clients in a day. The second or third client wouldn't have me at my fully rested self. I put in 5000 to 15000 smp hair follicle replications on average per session. So my wrists need rest.\n\nAs for you, the LGBTQ community, Or any human being in this world. Your sexual orientation, race, mindsets, religions, or any personal things have nothing to do with Scalp Micropigmentation.  I'm here to help anyone in need of SMP of any backround I don't discriminate. Your scalp and getting you a good high quality SMP outcome is great for us all. It's good for business and also for you to be happy is my goal. So shoot me a text or email anytime and I'll book you in for when im fully rested so we can get you the result you want. Thanks  ",

I rode my bike along the Seawall to the rendezvous point and added a wonderful 2nd Beach ocean swim at the end; a perfect way to experience the park for locals and visitors alike while also learning about BC West coast natural history and ecology. The feast on the beach was beyond my expectations: Dungeness  crab, smoked salmon, mussels, scallops, local wild mushrooms, sea asparagus and huckleberry tarts.  This tour would be a great idea for a foodie group, group birthday event or stagette/hen party.",

We were more than flattered and excited. I have heard many friends who have been unsuccessful to get an accepted offer. I would say because you have to meet a true realtor who works with you, not work for you. Cherry fulfilled our dream in one shot.

Two other people in line were coming back because their phones still weren't working properly after being fixed.\nIt was a nightmare I felt rushed and not listened to. The music was blaring.They charged me $500 dollars. I got home and the phone didn't work. They had made a big deal about throwing in a free screen protector but it was brittle plastic and when I dropped my phone on a thin carpet it broke and so did the screen. I always use a gel screen protector so this was ridiculous. Cheap cheap cheap! They refused to fix it so altogether I think I paid $700 for a phone that stopped working in less than a year. If you don't know much about electronics all of this is a bit daunting. I was recovering from an injury and wasn't very mobile.

For accessibility reason with my disability, I rely on the phone vibration to let me know that there's notification or a phone call, and I use the phone to text daily with haptic feedbacks on the keyboard, and whatnot.\n\nDay 1:\nPhone was working fine, including vibration and haptics. I was using the phone up to the last minute to browse the internet a bit while waiting, and the haptics were still working that time. My Pixel 5's battery capacity was low, so I decided to get a battery replacement at the store. I took the phone to the shop on Fraser Street, and was charged $110 and the warranty claims to repair all issues stemming from their repair.\n\nI picked up the phone 5pm same day and I was told leave the screen alone after sealing. Later in the night when I think the screen glue's solid enough, I noticed the phone vibration wasn't working.\n\nDay 2:\n10am in the morning: I went back to the shop to fix the vibration because. The male employee who looked at the phone, checked the vibration setting, agreed that it isn't working, and said the phone can be ready for pick up around 5pm.\n2pm: I checked with the store to see if the repair's been done. I was told it's in progress.\n4pm: I was told was still being fixed, and it'd be fixed before the store closes at 8pm.\n730pm: Tried calling them several times between 6pm to 7pm, and I didn't get a phone call back from them, so I went to the store and found it already closed.\n\nDay 3:\nThere was no communication from them for the whole day despite calling them to ask and getting voice mail. When I went to the store, my phone still had its screen removed. I was also told that the senior technician would come in the morning the next day, that it'll be fixed by 3pm tomorrow.\n\nDay 4:\nI went to the store at 3pm. My phone's vibration didn't work when picked up, had the setting looked through by the front desk employee. She confirmed that there's no settings. However, she also refused to accept that the battery replacement caused the vibration issues. As of midnight, the phone still had no vibration.\n\nDay 5:\nI went in again, and the same female employee went through the vibration test app and all the settings, and so did the older guy with glasses. However, they were insistent that the battery replacement didn't cause the vibration.\n\nWhen I asked the lady how are they sure that they didn't cause the damage. She claimed that their technicians \"know everything\". After a while they had the technician to come and talk to me again. When I asked the technician himself what's the problem with the vibration motor, he said didn't know why and that maybe my phone's been like this before I came to them.\n\nThe technician claimed that they do not touch the vibration motor at all so it couldn't have been their fault. He wrote that they can't open the phone again because the screen might break, even though the Gorilla Glass screen can withstand 500C easily. He added that if I take responsibility for the screen they can do it for a \"little charge\" of $30. And stresses that phone screens are very expensive.\n\nIt sounded like an insinuation an accident would happen to my phone if I kept pushing for warranty repair. For him to do his job, he'd have to remove the screen from every phone to do his work. For someone who does his daily work around phones, he lacked confidence in himself, otherwise he wouldn't ask clients responsible for the cost of broken glass screen and charge the more for extra repairs. Therefore, by asking me to take responsibility for the cost of the screen in case he damages it, he's being honest about his lack of ability (or care) to fix my problem. And that they won't cover a screen broken due to their own repairs.\n\nAs such, it's best to take the technician's advice to heart and not go to Fix 4 U Cellular and that there are more professional, competent, ethical, and knowledgeable cell phone repair shops elsewhere.",

We are a self managing complex so many questions needed to be addressed through adapting new bylaws which directly affected the depreciation report.  Michael was with us every step of the way to answer questions or direct us to the proper authority to get interpretation. He always answered emails promptly and shed light on any concerns we might have had.

Every appliance, the smallest of the knob or switches were cleaned with great care.\nThe team carried out the cleaning, as though it's their own home. I am so glad I booked Sweepy maids Vancouver.\nMy apartment is brand new now and a great thanks to this affectionate team. They made sure, I am well satisfied with their cleaning. They stayed a little extra and made sure everything was perfectly cleaned.\nThey made sure, not a single hair or dust particle remains on the walls or floor.

I booked a one hour treatment. The massage was very thorough and very good. Like in any other establishment of this kind the girl wants to upsell the service when you are most vulnerable and decide with the wrong head! I agreed to a service and let me tell you what followed was worth every nickel and dime spent and even more. It was the best service that I had in my over 60 years experience. I will definitely be back to see Sophia the next time I'm in the city! Highly recommended!",

Once started she was just rushing and did not know how to massage within 15minutes she finished her massage and told me to go so I asked why , look at the time .. they don't speak english and she started raising voice with me telling me to go. I still stayed and asked her for refund but she did not refund me . Very poor service and not loyal to the money paid . Never ever try them again , totally bad experience .",

Also, she asked for $80 for 30 mins which I thought was not fair according to their rates on the website.\nShe started the massage and did it for 15 mins only and told me that we are done. On asking about the time which I checked at the starting of the massage, she said that she is tired today and want to go home.\nEventually, I expressed that am not happy about it and she freaked out at me saying that she doesn't care.\nNEVER EVER GO HERE. There are many other good sensual massage spa in Vancouver and other areas. Try them out but not this one.\nThank you for your disgusting services, would never come back and would also not recommend to anyone.",

Mildly spicy and flavorful, yogurt on the side balances the heat. Great customer service. Fish looks big but not a lot of meat though. Still, I think price is reasonable for the serving size. Fries are crispy and not too salty. Will definitely consider going back here to try other dishes.",

One of my favorites is their signature dish \"Crispy Pata\" which I always order for takeout. Very crispy and cooked to perfection which is completely paired with their signature vinegar dipping sauce. They also serve various desserts such as halo-halo (sweet shaved ice dessert with various toppings), Turon ( sweet banana-jackfruit spring roll), Buko Pandan (coconut and pandan flavored gelatin with cream and sweetened milk), and a lot more.\n\nThe place also features decor and ambiance, reflecting Filipino culture with Filipino music playing in the background. Plus, they have a very friendly, welcoming, and pretty staff. This is a must-try restaurant that tastes like Home. If you miss Pinoy foods or want to try authentic Filipino cuisine, this place is for you.",

Working with Fraserview was extremely easy and the staff prioritize their customers and truly want you to have the best experience.\n\nThe hall itself is a stunning venue with chandeliers throughout the hall, a massive elevated dancefloor, modern carpeting, high quality speaker system and a gorgeous outdoor balcony that my guests enjoyed majority of their evening taking pictures outside on a sunny day.\n\nI can't thank the Manager Antony enough for his exceptional customer service. He is solely the reason why I booked both of my events at Fraserview Hall. I had other deposits at another competing hall but Antony ensured me that I was in good hands and now that my events are over I can 1000% say that Fraserview Hall exceeded my expectations. My family and friends are now booking Fraserview Hall for their events after attending mine. It was the most glamorous Haldi and Wedding Reception I've ever experienced and booking Fraserview Hall was the best decision!\n\nThe in house DJ was wonderful and played beautiful songs that my guests and myself could dance all night to. I highly recommend booking the in house DJ, they are very organized and prepare all your songs to make sure everything runs smoothly.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious, my guests had second helpings and several people told me their favourite items were the vegetable chow mein, fish pakora, chicken tikka, goat curry and bbq tandoori chicken.\n\nI also really enjoyed working with the Decor team. They truly worked their magic and made every detail look absolutely perfect. My Haldi night looked like a Bollywood movie set with all the beautiful bright colours, umbrella arch, glittery table runners, gold elephants and fancy decor pieces.\n\nThey also created the most stunning set up for my Reception which included a hanging floral and crystal walkway, floating candles, chandeliers, white roses with an elegant backdrop for the stage. They upgraded and sourced gorgeous decor and took care of everything. I am grateful for the hard working staff, especially Harmeet and Shrungerri who executed my visions and made them better! My advice to anyone booking Fraserview Hall is to trust the staff, they know what they are doing and you will not be disappointed.",

However, in particular, I would like to thank the gentleman standing outside the front door, who was responsible for security in the evening. We could not find parking so parked in the lot across the street and when he saw us approaching, he let us know that we should move our vehicle, as it would get towed.  During our conversation, we mentioned that we had a handicap parking decal, and he immediately offered us the parking spot that was reserved with pylons right next to the entrance of the hall. This is a level of courtesy that we usually do not see at these types of events. I appreciate Fraserview hiring staff members that care for their guests.",

I was polite and very understanding and to be left in the dark for days after reaching out to them after spending good money is not very good business. Going to try ordering from Serenity Seamoss and hopefully I will get a refund from The Heal Market because the product was compromised.

So half of the kitchen flooring is incomplete (old flooring hidden under the cabinetry). Would have been much better to be up front about that at the beginning.\n\n- They promised to replace our baseboards, but during the renovations they said the original baseboards were fine and asked if they would just use those. We ask for them to go ahead with new ones thing they would do the full job. Instead they cut new baseboards without painting them properly and never added caulking. So we were left to do that our selves.\n\n- They messed up one of our closet doors (couldn't get it to fit back in) so they cut it. Now the one door doesn't match the height of the other.\n\nOverall, a lot of the issues could have been prevented with better communication on their part before and during the project.

The other customer said ring the bell and I said, he knows I am here, he told me to have a seat for a moment and I have been here for 20 minutes before you came in, he knows I am here.\n\nRandy then comes toward the waiting area and interrupts our conversation with a question what about was said about the bell on the desk.

I said Randy no one is arguing about anything and the conversation was between me and the man I was speaking with.

One person, with a head-shake of disbelief, pitied the 'beneficiaries' of your psychological work. Now I'm seeing the irony in how a person trained to understand humankind can't wrap his mind around a simple concept of 'waiting one's turn - no babysitting required' & 'complaining as a way to force entitlement on others'.\n\nThere was also discussion about how you openly usurped the authority of God Almighty in your feeble attempt at bullying as if 'the powers had been vested in you' or some other silly nonsense. We don't tolerate such behavior so when you began attacking, accusing, and displaying prejudice... ya, you're going to have to leave. Permanently.  Discrediting Christianity by representing it horribly is a symptom of something quite negative.\n\nCLARIFICATION: you as a no-appointment drop-in were assured that we would be able to assist you in repairing a tire without having to leave it and return (unlike the other shops you tried). The shop was informed that you (a drop-in tire repair) were waiting to have your tire repaired. The shop (not me as I'm not the person in the back doing the tire repairs (as you erroneously concluded)) continued with the work that was booked before you while I, doing my part, ensured that the shop ran smoothly. I also took payment/invoiced a customer who's vehicle was completed, had a conversation with a customer as part of my lunch-break, and spent a couple minutes actually eating my lunch and replying to emails. I think the rest of your utter misconstrued blah blah blah above demonstrates the rest of the story.\n\nComplaining to others who were waiting then denying when I overheard and attempted to explain was also immature.\n\nWe don't like people who berate/belittle service industry people. We don't like people who place themselves above their neighbours. We don't like people who are openly judgmental. And we don't like people who bring negativity (toxicity) into our space. You are all of these things. Standing up and blurting out - as some type of qualifier - that you are a psychologist so you know Randy is wrong sealed the deal.\n\nEnjoy your life. Enjoy the ramifications of the path you've justified taking. Enjoy blessing another shop in Vancouver with your superiority complex. We all enjoyed the relief and peace that was restored after you stomped off like a child. Our world is better without you.\n\nBlessings & buh-bye. \n",

While we were there we saw that you had a better deal for the Frame TV 65 inch that we purchased the day before from Bestbuy.  It wasn't too much of a difference in price but the service was definitely different.  He explained more details about the TV and told us why we should buy the warranty.  I told him that we didn't buy the warranty at Best Buy because they didn't really have anyone that's was experienced enough to sell me the warranty other than telling me what the price was.  So with that said he spent the time with us gave us all the benefits about the TV and explained to us that if we bought the 5 year warranty and didn't use the warranty in 5 years that we would get a store credit to buy anything we wanted in the store. This definitely was a great selling feature and after that experience we bought the TV with the warranty from Rhythm and told him we will pay first and pick up the TV tomorrow as we needed to return the TV we bought from Bestbuy first as we didn't have space.  Thank you for a wonderful experience and we will definitely be buying more from Rhythm from SE marine Drive Visions.\n\nThanks, Donald",

So I ended up getting Corn, Sour Cream and Cheese.  They made the fresh.  They didn't have fries pre made.  So the fries were fresh and hot.  I watched her make the friend and it is quite the process.  I can see why people complain about the time.  But it's made to order and it's a process to season the fries.  My kids and family loved the fries.  The kids loved the corn and I wish we ordered bigger size.  Next time I would order larger size cause it didn't not last long and it's not much of a price increase for a bigger size.  Really friendly staff and can tell she took pride in her work.  I hope they continue to provide excellent fries without compromising the quality for speeding up the process.",

I was waiting to get food at KFC but the line was too long! I was walking around and decided to opt for this place instead as it said \"best curry\" on the sign. The service was quick, the food was fresh and you could tell the meats were marinaded in the curry due to the nice colour gradient from the protein. Super flavourful, the mild curry is basically non-spicy and everything was packed nicely and a good portion. Didn't get a photo of the naan as I was too hungry and forgot... Would come back and would recommend.",

Give amazing portions for your buck with lots of flavours. Don't ever change your recipe or portions because this is too amazing.\n\nButter chicken: this is my favourite out of the two. Lots of flavours, chicken and spices. Don't forgot to ask for tomatoes, onions etc on the side. Also get their garlic naan! It matches so perfectly with this dish! Chicken was a bit dry, but I like to shred them into pieces. Love the amount of chicken\n\nChicken tikka masala: this is super delicious and have a more refreshing herb and spices taste to it. Has onions and peppers in the dish if you like more veggies in your dish.\n\nWould definitely come here again and order! The best butter chicken I had so far in Vancouver and highly recommend for those to come and try!",

This was no easy task as it required a 6ft deep x 10ft long trench to be hand dug. This was completed in less than a week! A Herculean task!\n\nKevin at Mr. Rooter then referred us to BC Preferred Restoration to do major repairs in the basement suite. The floor, dry wall and cabinets had to be replaced as they were all contaminated by sewer water. Steve in the head office guided as expertly through the insurance maze. He was responsive and professional. Ivan's work was top notch and we are very pleased with the end product.\n\nMr. Rooter and BC Preferred Restoration took a horrible nasty incident and made it tolerable with a timely professional approach. 5Star experience.",

From the moment I met him, his ability to clearly communicate all the details and process involved made the entire experience enjoyable. He took the time to patiently explain every aspect of the Scalp Micropigmentation (SMP) procedure, ensuring that I had a thorough understanding of what to expect. His professionalism and passion for his work were evident throughout, instilling confidence in his abilities.\n\nDuring the SMP process, Rob's attention to detail and precision were remarkable. He carefully considered factors such as hairline design, color matching, and shading, ensuring that the results would look natural and seamlessly blend with my existing hair. The final outcome exceeded my expectations, and I couldn't be happier with the results. Rob's talent for creating realistic and flawless SMP results is truly impressive.\n\nAside from his exceptional skills, Rob's friendly and approachable demeanor made the entire experience even more enjoyable. We spent several hours chatting during the sessions, and it felt like spending time with a friend rather than a professional. His ability to make me feel comfortable and at ease was genuinely appreciated.\n\nIf you're looking for a skilled SMP practitioner who can deliver outstanding results while making the process enjoyable, look no further than Rob James.",

Having to walk over to find a closed branch on Monday when I definitely needed to do a face to face meeting is very frustrating.  Sure there are other Vancity branches open, but now I need to drive my gasoline powered car to another branch further away is definitely not good to the environment!\n\nPlease don't make lame excuses and respond directly to why the Victoria Drive branch cannot open Monday to Saturday just like other financial institutions nearby?",

I saw them going into the cafe and many of the employees of the supply store they are located at. Had no idea it was at a lumber and hardware supply warehouse, surrounded by many other commercial warehouses, such a great surprise, which just makes it that much better. Absolutely loved the atmosphere and the owners. Very friendly older couple and their son run this awesome famiky owned cafe.\n\nAwesome home cooked breakfast, amazing friendly and relaxed service, and unbelievable atmosphere. When I got there, I was the only one, but I still loved it so much. The old school diner style furniture and music were awesome. I got the pancake with blueberries, sunny side up eggs, and sausage, which were all very good. Loved their old small glass coffee maker and the mugs. The son who was serving was very nice and friendly....he me told me that this place has been around since the 1940s and his parents got this place 15 years ago have been in the business for so long after they retired, wanted to have a slow and small place and now this place is exploded and is crazy busy ...which I find very funny and awesome.\n\nWill definitely come back to try their burgers and Chinese food.",

The decision to reserve a table proved to be wise; we were seated almost immediately upon arrival, avoiding the long wait times that had deterred us during a previous attempt to dine here.\n\nDon't be fooled by it's surprising location or the state of the building (which might seem to some as if it were about to collapse at any moment).  Inside is something you won't find anywhere else in Vancouver!\n\nThe atmosphere at Northern Cafe is inviting, reflecting its family-run ethos. The menu offers a variety of comfort food options, and we opted for burgers and a side of poutine. The food was exceptional--each bite of the burger was a blend of flavors and textures, and the poutine was a delightful mix of crispy fries, cheese, and well-balanced gravy.\n\nWhat stood out, even more, was the service. The staff were attentive and courteous, enhancing the overall dining experience. It's evident why this establishment has garnered such high praise and even topped lists of the best places to eat in Canada.\n\nA particularly charming touch was the inclusion of watermelon slices with our meal. It added a refreshing contrast to the hearty fare and demonstrated the restaurant's attention to detail. Another delightful aspect was the handwritten reviews by children displayed on the wall, which actually helped us make our menu choices.\n\nNorthern Cafe lives up to its reputation. The combination of delicious food, excellent service, and a welcoming atmosphere makes it a must-visit. Making a reservation is highly recommended!",

Inside is something you won't find anywhere else in Vancouver!\n\nThe atmosphere at Northern Cafe is inviting, reflecting its family-run ethos. The menu offers a variety of comfort food options, and we opted for burgers and a side of poutine. The food was exceptional--each bite of the burger was a blend of flavors and textures, and the poutine was a delightful mix of crispy fries, cheese, and well-balanced gravy.\n\nWhat stood out, even more, was the service. The staff were attentive and courteous, enhancing the overall dining experience. It's evident why this establishment has garnered such high praise and even topped lists of the best places to eat in Canada.\n\nA particularly charming touch was the inclusion of watermelon slices with our meal. It added a refreshing contrast to the hearty fare and demonstrated the restaurant's attention to detail. Another delightful aspect was the handwritten reviews by children displayed on the wall, which actually helped us make our menu choices.\n\nNorthern Cafe lives up to its reputation. The combination of delicious food, excellent service, and a welcoming atmosphere makes it a must-visit. Making a reservation is highly recommended!",

I can't imagine how this place is during rush hour because it's small and tight and the low ceiling doesn't help at all but cool. I ordered the northern deluxe burger and my wife got the wonton noodle soup. I thought the burger was good, but IMO a little expensive especially for a cash only business, which I'm not a fan of. Unfortunately my wife did not like the wonton noodle soup. I blame social media for over hyping it. The Service was amazing!! it's expected from a family owned business! The service alone is enough to support this restaurant. I still highly recommend this place! You can't go wrong with the burger and BRING CASH!",

I got the Steamed Pork Buns (Xiao Long Bao/Soup Dumplings), Pan Fried Pork Buns, Pan Fried Dumplings and Beef Roll! I would recommend everything because it was really affordable and yummy. The soup from the Steamed and Fried Pork Buns was really flavourful! The Pan Fried Dumplings had a lot of filling and isn't like other dumplings I've had at other restaurants (which are sometimes frozen). You have to get the Beef Roll, I love the amount of meat, cucumbers and sauce there is in it! Another thing I like is how they have chili oil and vinegar at the table for you! I can't wait to come back and try their noodles and wontons,unfortunately it was too hot for that today.",
