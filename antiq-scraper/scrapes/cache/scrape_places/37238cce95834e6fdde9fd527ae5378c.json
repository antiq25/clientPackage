The rest was sweet and tasted exactly as expected, especially the strawberry cake and the lychee black tea. Not to make that sound bad, they're staples in every store for a reason (they never miss)!!

Still drank it all, but probably wouldn't get it again...\n\nOther than that, the decor was nice and clean and the atmosphere was quiet and serene. Also, it's a little on the expensive side... so definitely more of an experience than a regular hang-out spot. Hope the employees enjoyed the relaxing morning as it seemed like a slow shift (to be fair we went around brunch time on a Tuesday).

The cake was refreshing and smooth with crunchy chocolate bites. The lavender flavour in the drink was strong, and I liked that it wasn't overpowered by the blueberry. The plastic cake cylinder snaps onto the drink lid for easy transport. The shop is clean with cute decor. It's a tad pricey so not your everyday treat, but they have unique flavours that warrant a trip back.",

I hope no other bride has to deal with this company.\n\nFirst, she showed up late even though we had discussed her arriving early to set up before the wedding reception. We had a line up of people at the bar with no bartender before she even arrived. She also said she was arriving with a complete bar set up with cups and martini shakers as our signature drink was a martini.\nAndrea did not bring nearly enough cups to the event and was telling guests to keep their plastic cups. She was free pouring all the martinis and was not even using all the ingredients that were laid out for her.\n\nThe biggest issue we had was we agreed on either a prepaid tip in advance or a tip jar. We decided on a prepaid tip from us so our wedding guests would not have to tip. Andrea asked us how she would approach guests who wanted to tip her anyways. We simply told her to tell guests that the bride and groom were taking care of gratuity. This is not uncommon at all with weddings, and was already agreed upon in an email that we would pay the tip in advance. She then took tips throughout the night and ended up leaving with a large tip jar including multiple bills.. we had a toonie bar. I can't help but assume she took money from our cash made from the bar and helped herself.\n\nI am only writing this review because this was one of the most important days of our lives and we feel so taken advantage of. Such unprofessional and shady service and I hope no other bride has to deal with this company or wage their money on this terrible experience. I asked for my original tip back and was ignored.\n\nI hope other brides read this and DO NOT HIRE this company.",

I can walk, bike, and drive again, and my cognition and screen time tolerance is improving with the exercises.

She told me about certain exercises that I should do to strengthen & stretching my glutes & hamstrings, as I wasn't in good shape to play golf. Doc said it'd take 6-12 weeks, but I played my first golf 5 weeks after injury and I played better because I was more stronger in my core and glutes. I'm still getting treatments b'c of sore left shoulder & back and she's used shock therapy for shoulder and it has rapidly helped the shoulder. My back pain is also getting better. 6 weeks later now, I'm playing golf better & I can run if I have to, btw, I'm a newish senior. I'm planning to check in with Krishna from time to time if I feel aches & pains. Thanks much, Krishna!",

The music was blaring.They charged me $500 dollars. I got home and the phone didn't work. They had made a big deal about throwing in a free screen protector but it was brittle plastic and when I dropped my phone on a thin carpet it broke and so did the screen. I always use a gel screen protector so this was ridiculous. Cheap cheap cheap! They refused to fix it so altogether I think I paid $700 for a phone that stopped working in less than a year.

For accessibility reason with my disability, I rely on the phone vibration to let me know that there's notification or a phone call, and I use the phone to text daily with haptic feedbacks on the keyboard, and whatnot.\n\nDay 1:\nPhone was working fine, including vibration and haptics. I was using the phone up to the last minute to browse the internet a bit while waiting, and the haptics were still working that time. My Pixel 5's battery capacity was low, so I decided to get a battery replacement at the store. I took the phone to the shop on Fraser Street, and was charged $110 and the warranty claims to repair all issues stemming from their repair.\n\nI picked up the phone 5pm same day and I was told leave the screen alone after sealing. Later in the night when I think the screen glue's solid enough, I noticed the phone vibration wasn't working.\n\nDay 2:\n10am in the morning: I went back to the shop to fix the vibration because. The male employee who looked at the phone, checked the vibration setting, agreed that it isn't working, and said the phone can be ready for pick up around 5pm.\n2pm: I checked with the store to see if the repair's been done. I was told it's in progress.\n4pm: I was told was still being fixed, and it'd be fixed before the store closes at 8pm.\n730pm: Tried calling them several times between 6pm to 7pm, and I didn't get a phone call back from them, so I went to the store and found it already closed.\n\nDay 3:\nThere was no communication from them for the whole day despite calling them to ask and getting voice mail. When I went to the store, my phone still had its screen removed. I was also told that the senior technician would come in the morning the next day, that it'll be fixed by 3pm tomorrow.\n\nDay 4:\nI went to the store at 3pm. My phone's vibration didn't work when picked up, had the setting looked through by the front desk employee. She confirmed that there's no settings. However, she also refused to accept that the battery replacement caused the vibration issues. As of midnight, the phone still had no vibration.\n\nDay 5:\nI went in again, and the same female employee went through the vibration test app and all the settings, and so did the older guy with glasses. However, they were insistent that the battery replacement didn't cause the vibration.\n\nWhen I asked the lady how are they sure that they didn't cause the damage. She claimed that their technicians \"know everything\". After a while they had the technician to come and talk to me again. When I asked the technician himself what's the problem with the vibration motor, he said didn't know why and that maybe my phone's been like this before I came to them.\n\nThe technician claimed that they do not touch the vibration motor at all so it couldn't have been their fault. He wrote that they can't open the phone again because the screen might break, even though the Gorilla Glass screen can withstand 500C easily. He added that if I take responsibility for the screen they can do it for a \"little charge\" of $30. And stresses that phone screens are very expensive.\n\nIt sounded like an insinuation an accident would happen to my phone if I kept pushing for warranty repair. For him to do his job, he'd have to remove the screen from every phone to do his work. For someone who does his daily work around phones, he lacked confidence in himself, otherwise he wouldn't ask clients responsible for the cost of broken glass screen and charge the more for extra repairs. Therefore, by asking me to take responsibility for the cost of the screen in case he damages it, he's being honest about his lack of ability (or care) to fix my problem. And that they won't cover a screen broken due to their own repairs.\n\nAs such, it's best to take the technician's advice to heart and not go to Fix 4 U Cellular and that there are more professional, competent, ethical, and knowledgeable cell phone repair shops elsewhere.",

Everyone at the gym was kind and helpful especially my lovely trainer, Rachel. Rachel was tough at times, I used to call her evil, and very caring and attentive on the days I was feeling down. I enjoyed training with Rachel, I enjoyed the music she used to play for my sessions and I was very happy with the transformation I saw on my body after only 2 months of training. Also, I appreciate how Rachel was very understanding of my busy schedule and how she used to push me to keep coming to the sessions regularly. I am very happy with the results I achieved in the 6 months of training with Rachel and I would've continued working with her if I didn't have to move out of town. All the best Rachel :)",

Also, I appreciate how Rachel was very understanding of my busy schedule and how she used to push me to keep coming to the sessions regularly. I am very happy with the results I achieved in the 6 months of training with Rachel and I would've continued working with her if I didn't have to move out of town. All the best Rachel :)",

I went from almost 130lbs of \"skinny fat\" to 114lbs of muscle. He has helped me obtain the physique I've always wanted and the strength I never knew that I had. He's incredibly attentive, knowledgeable, and an overall genuine trainer and boxing coach.  His positive attitude and approachable nature makes me feel completely at ease. I cannot recommend David enough as he truly knows what he is doing and you will see how he genuinely cares about your goals. He radiates passion and dedication for his clients and I absolutely love training with him. He will make you succeed with your fitness goals. If you're seeking a trainer who will produce results and make you enjoy it at the same time - you have found the right place. My only regret is not starting with him sooner.

Trying to cancel an appointment is nearly impossible - they expect you to notify them 24 hours ahead to cancel your appointment otherwise will charge you a fee, but when you go to cancel online the online booking says unable to cancel due to being <48hrs and to call the clinic to cancel? Then if you try calling, they don't answer their phone because their hours to pick up the phone is 9-12? Because of covid?? They are always rude whenever I tried booking or calling about anything. I had to get a form filled out by my doctor which she was willing to do as it was healthcare work related, then when I call the office the receptionist doesn't allow me to speak to her or let me get the form filled unless I pay 40$? After speaking with my doctor directly she didn't even mention a charge being needed. They seriously need to rethink how they deliver patient centred care as their clinic is far from that.",

Sadly, this was a huge mistake on our part. We took our cat in for her annual checkup. All of the documents were transferred from our previous vet to this one, so it should have her up to date vaccine information and other health background. Unfortunately, Dr. Shura didn't even pay attention to her vaccination history anyways, and despite our cat having gotten her 3-year vaccines in 2018, he said it was done in 2017 and then vaccinated her anyways. I didn't notice this until I got home and saw my previous invoices from the previous vet that said she last got the vaccination in 2018. A few days after we got home from the vet, my cat's hair started falling out in the area where the vaccination was injected. We tried calling Vancouver East Veterinary Walk-In Clinic on Wednesday at around 10AM and there was no pick-up (they are closed most of the week, open only for limited hours in the afternoon), no voice mail, and no emergency line you can call. We ended up having to drive back to our old vet to get her looked at because that was our only option. I understand that adverse side effect may happen after a vaccination, but I am very disappointed that the vet misread her vaccination history and gave her something she didn't need, and also we weren't able to reach them or an alternate number. When we were getting our cat looked at, Mr. Shura said to us that he doesn't like to overvaccinate animals because he'll get our money through teeth cleanings anyways (he had recommended a teeth cleaning for our cat). I couldn't tell if he was a vet or a used car salesman.",

Sadly, this was a huge mistake on our part. We took our cat in for her annual checkup. All of the documents were transferred from our previous vet to this one, so it should have her up to date vaccine information and other health background. Unfortunately, Dr. Shura didn't even pay attention to her vaccination history anyways, and despite our cat having gotten her 3-year vaccines in 2018, he said it was done in 2017 and then vaccinated her anyways. I didn't notice this until I got home and saw my previous invoices from the previous vet that said she last got the vaccination in 2018. A few days after we got home from the vet, my cat's hair started falling out in the area where the vaccination was injected.

It started with busstops, billboards, note pads... then one day I was driving down Kingsway and bam!!  right beside me is a 4 foot image on a car of Brandon! I went home and told my wife I think I found our realtor. I called Brandon and he came to our current home at the time and gave us a breakdown on market/value. He is very well spoken , confident , handsome young man and has his finger on the heartbeat of the market so we decided to list. We listed aggressively as he suggested and this fetched us multiple offers with our property going 80k over asking!! What a beauty! This was only one experience with Brandon. The second experience is a single family home in Montecito burnaby. I had fully renovated. Brandon showed up and fell in love with the place. I told Brandon \"do you think we can get $2.5\" we had purchased 1.5 years prior for $1.840 he said yeah l let's try! I believed that if anyone could fetch this number it would be him. Brandon had beautiful photos taken, drone shots, and a walk through video featuring,  yes! The one and only Brandon Gee Moore!! Brandon got us the number we wanted yet again for another huge win. Now we had sold and we did not have a house to move to only a pocket full of cash. This is great but not when you have a pregnant wife and two other kids! He worked day and night until he found us our dream property. No wonder this guy is top 1% . If you can say Brandon you can say SOLD!",

Operates Monday to Friday. Lovely and professional staff who remain patient, helpful and composed during this unusually difficult time.\n\nOur family is seen and treated by Dr Vasquez who has brilliant reviews on Rate My MD (not at all surprising). We have also seen Dr Cubra on occasion when Dr Vasquez has been away. Both doctors are incredibly patient, empathetic, and knowledgeable with relationships to other fantastic specialists in the community.\n\nDr Vasquez is hardly ever late for an appointment - sometimes he is a few minutes early. On the rare occasion I have waited an additional 5-10 minutes but this is a far departure from our previous GP. I can't believe had become accustomed to\nwaiting 1 hour + elsewhere.\n\nWhen this clinic moved into our neighbourhood a few years ago, I happened to ask the receptionist which doctor I should see and they told me that ALL of them were amazing. We have happily found this to be true!",

I find their service always friendly and I never feel rushed when booking an appointment or asking a question, even though they are very busy!\n\n- I use the walk-in clinic here and Dr. Cubra is absolutely amazing. He is the kindest doctor,  very patient, understanding, trustworthy and extremely knowledgeable. I never feel rushed and he always takes the time to listen to my symptoms and explain his recommendations. I truly believe he goes above and beyond for all the patients he sees. He has been an extremely huge help (especially this year) for me and I am so thankful for him and this clinic. The team at this clinic...they are the best!\n\n- I have never felt I had to wait an unreasonable amount of time, which is amazing for a walk-in clinic.

With people who have a large area or full scalp correction ( like yourself having alopecia) I want to give you / all my clients a high quality result and a quality SMP session. So I need 1 day free before your session and 1 day free after. I do this to keep my wrists fully rested and healed for each client. Most company's take on multiple clients in a day and they have you on a time clock. When they do this they just spread out your smp Pigmenting and keep asking you to come back in for more sessions(sometimes 4 to 6 sessions). But with my business, I want to try my best to get everyone done in 2 sessions. (90%) of my clients are done in 2 sessions. Because I take my time and again only take on 1 client in a day or every other day when doing large sessions. So you have me at my best rested self. I'm all about quality over quantity. I don't think its fair if I took multiple clients in a day. The second or third client wouldn't have me at my fully rested self. I put in 5000 to 15000 smp hair follicle replications on average per session. So my wrists need rest.\n\nAs for you, the LGBTQ community, Or any human being in this world. Your sexual orientation, race, mindsets, religions, or any personal things have nothing to do with Scalp Micropigmentation.  I'm here to help anyone in need of SMP of any backround I don't discriminate. Your scalp and getting you a good high quality SMP outcome is great for us all. It's good for business and also for you to be happy is my goal. So shoot me a text or email anytime and I'll book you in for when im fully rested so we can get you the result you want. Thanks  ",

If our patients are unable to make it to the time they booked, they are welcome to call in and adjust their appointment 24 hours before their booked time. If our patients have an emergency or a legitimate reason, we usually waive the no show fee and end with a warning. Phone appointments are just as important as in-person appointments, which is why there is a no show fee for phone calls as well. If you still have any questions or concerns, please email us at info@forwardcaremedical.com and we will assist you the best of our abilities.\n\nThank you,\nFCM",

The podiatrist seemed very unsure of herself, which was a bit unsettling, but I decided to have the procedure done anyway because I just wanted it done and it's relatively simple. The room was very small and cramped, I'm not sure if the podiatrist has their own office. Because the office was small, the equipment seemed a bit disorganized. The procedure seemed to be done okay, the incisions seemed straight and I think the phenol was applied, but the ingrown toenail has returned. Everything about the experience was mediocre, and now I have to get the procedure done again anyway somewhere else.",

Just before Xmas last year my daughter and I got a little ginger girl and we love her so much we wanted to give her a friend.  Of course we went back to Nikki and she didn't let us down. Nikki briefly spoke of how some of these cats as well as dogs,  had been treated prior to her stepping in and rescuing them and about how the pandemic and natural disasters have increased the poor faith of these vulnerable animals.  She really cares for animals.  She is defiantly a cat lady through and through. The work she does for these animals is incredible. I don't know what will happen to all the animals in the b.c in distress when she retires. Although I can't see her retiring bc she cares too much about animals being treated badly. Weather it be an issue of hoarding, owners on substances and or natural disasters. As well as her program for seniors she is right on it. We often get caught up in our busy lives and  forget about animals and there well being.  If you can't adopt a cat from Nikki please consider sponsoring a cat or make a donation. I'm not sure if she excepts blankets and towels but that could be an idea as well.",

Nikki briefly spoke of how some of these cats as well as dogs,  had been treated prior to her stepping in and rescuing them and about how the pandemic and natural disasters have increased the poor faith of these vulnerable animals.  She really cares for animals.  She is defiantly a cat lady through and through. The work she does for these animals is incredible. I don't know what will happen to all the animals in the b.c in distress when she retires. Although I can't see her retiring bc she cares too much about animals being treated badly. Weather it be an issue of hoarding, owners on substances and or natural disasters. As well as her program for seniors she is right on it. We often get caught up in our busy lives and  forget about animals and there well being.  If you can't adopt a cat from Nikki please consider sponsoring a cat or make a donation. I'm not sure if she excepts blankets and towels but that could be an idea as well.",

I don't know how, but I even touched on topics that I thought about but didn't voice. It feels like everything is falling into place. She approached everything very thoroughly, carefully leads the session, you can feel sincere immersion and interest!\n\nBut the main thing is what conclusions I made and where to go for at least the next couple of years. Because of the events in Ukraine, I had to start my life from scratch and of course there were questions about whether I should continue to engage in the same activities and whether I was on my way, the consultation helped me understand all this\n\nMany thanks ",

Cherry sent us the recent sale history in the neighborhood. Communicated with the listing agents to follow up the status of any potential submissions. Guide us how to present the offers to win in this bidding game and not too much over listing price and within our comfort and affordable zone. good news came back 2 hours after the offer submission. We were more than flattered and excited. I have heard many friends who have been unsuccessful to get an accepted offer. I would say because you have to meet a true realtor who works with you, not work for you. Cherry fulfilled our dream in one shot. The reason she is able to do it is she is experienced and knowledgeable. She will only tell us the truth without cosmetic to the transactions. She is efficient and high energy to her career. Highly Recommend Cherry to all of you",
