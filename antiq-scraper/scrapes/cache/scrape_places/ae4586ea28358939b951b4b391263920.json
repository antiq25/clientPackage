As this restaurant already has a good track record via other reviews, I think this place is more mediocre compared to other HongKong style kitchens. Why, you may ask? Well, the main reason was because there was nothing special about it. The only thing that sparked my interest was the pork chop sandwich, which didn't get me wrong, tasted good, but everything else (excluding customer service) was lacking. From the food to the seating (which I mind you are half car seats half regular chairs) limited my comfort during my eating experience.\n\nThe meal I had was the problem chop sandwich, although good, lacked balance between freshness and saltiness. All you can realistically taste are the savory flavors of the marinated porkchop (and baking soda, which makes it tender) the mayo and a bit of the onions. On top of that, the sandwich came with a big bed of fries, which adds onto the savory oily pork chop. Also, the Hong Kong style milk tea tastes the same as any other H.K Cafe within Metro Vancouver.\n\nMy friends' satay noodles were plain and full of msg (like the majority), nothing really special at all. The breakfast meal is decent in terms of taste but is a bang for your buck. You get to try multiple items for a decent price. Comes with a drink also. Again, nothing surprising compared to any other H.K style Cafe.\n\nTo leave this mediocre review with a high note, the customer service was nice. The waitress noticed my fries were missing and quickly asked the chef to cook the fries fresh for me and apologized. In my opinion, it's not a big gripe, which is why I would give this place a solid 3 stars. I would recommend giving this place a try for most, but it can be a hit or miss (depending on what you order)",

The meats here are always executed to technical perfection: juicy and tender with crispy but not greasy skin.\n\nGiven this is a small restaurant with only 9 tables, I'm impressed by the diversity and quality of the food. Furthermore impressed that most meals are at the $10 and $15 price points.\n\nBeef and mushroom sandwich: Was eclipsed by the fries, which were prepared my favourite way, with batter and crispy. The sandwich was nice too, lots of beef, tender and cooked medium rare the way I like. Only complaint was that there was some cartilage in the meat, which I had to cut out.\n\nPanko-fried pork chops: Again, lots of meat, two chops, which were tender, juicy, and just gently seasoned, the way I like.\n\nChicken rice noodle soup had a perfectly  grilled boneless chicken thigh with crispy skin.\n\nMixed grill: All meats grilled to textural perfection. Enough food for 2 people. Onion gravy good with fries.\n\nService excellent, attentive, friendly, with a personal touch.",

The food is a fusion of Indian and Mediterranean cuisine and plated in a Nutritious way which is cherry on top! \n\nThis place has a great ambiance and located is at a great location; convenient for people taking public transportation as well as driving.

The items we didn't like tasted sweet, not savoury.\nThe stuffed roti with yam was sweet, but okay.\nThe portion sizes were good for the cost.\nI liked the vegan khir but it's cold and I would prefer it to be warm.\nI love the cardamom cookie!\nThe masala soy chai was awesome.\nThey have items to accommodate all dietary restrictions so we would eat here again.\nThe servers were attentive and explained the menu well.\nThe place is pretty and spacious.\nThe bathroom was clean too.",

First impressions, the architecture and decor is superb and a delight for the visual senses. Despite being a busy Saturday evening, we were greeted promptly and courteously by the front desk. The hospitality was fantastic- we were offered a delicious tea and boulani while waiting for our table. We were seated close to the \"stage\". The table was quite small for our group of 4. And although the chairs were beautifully handcrafted, they were not comfortable. We each selected the feast. At $43 pp, it was a great way to taste the menu. I would suggest having a similar tasting option for children at a reduced rate. Our favourite items were the joojeh chicken kebab, lamb curry, Tibetan mantu, and the peas with cheese. Service was prompt for the most part although the chicken kebabs did take a while longer. The servers were friendly and courteous nonetheless. The violin music in the background was a nice touch. Overall highly recommend you visit this beautiful restaurant and delight your senses! Thanks for the bday gesture of song and gulab jamun :)",

As well as the penne cotta dessert, we shared one, but I could have easily ate two to myself because it was honestly that great. Everything else was not bad, but nothing I would write home about. The ambience of the resturant is a dark and loud because of how packed it was. Overall, not bad, but I likely would not come back because it is not my preference.",

It's a nice spot in Chinatown area with clean but cozy aesthetics.\n\nThe waiter was friendly and very fast and the food was pretty great.\n\nI got their Maialona sandwich which was fantastic. I wish they went heavier on the pesto but other than that, it was very tasty.\n\nWe also got Cotoletta sandwich and Pappardelle al Ragu di Cinghiale. I thought that the ragu could have had more meat and I've had better pappardelle noodles, but the sauce was good.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience here and would come back!",

They serve sandwiches with this bread at lunch!\n3) Panzanella (missing from photos, too busy enjoying food) - nice fresh salad with a sweet sherry vinaigrette. I love the vanilla pickled strawberries they add in there.\n4) Carpaccio - high quality beef with  \"ubriacato di vino\" buffalo cheese\n5) Rosticciana - braised ribs where the meat just falls off the bone with a gentle nudge. The smoked cherry glaze was so amazing I had to stop myself from licking the plate.\n6) Ravioli al Nero di Seppia - squid ink ravioli with sweetcorn that pairs so nice with the lobster and prawns\n7) Coccoli e Proscuitto - this is a ** MUST TRY **. Deep fried dough is very unique and paired with whipped stracchino cheese and 18 month Prosciutto di Parma makes it an incredibly delicious must try.\n8) Gnocchetti - excellent texture on this Gnocchetti, which is a smaller gnocchi. The flavours are wonderful. I loved that there was a bit of spicy kick to it.\n9) Torta all'olio - I love the citrus from the orange balancing out the slight sweetness of the cake\n10) Tiramisu - this Tiramisu is very nice. It has a darker espresso flavour, not acidic, which I really like and the cake overall is sweet, but definitely not overly sweet.",

My younger daughter can't have dairy and we were pleasantly surprised she had enough options, plus our server let us know we could get the gnocchi with red sauce to avoid dairy. Whole family left happy and full! My husband wishes he could get the recipe for the cherry sauce they have for the ribs and my older daughter wishes we could get more of the ravioli!",

I was initially drawn in by their enticing drink specials -- $3.49 shots including choices like Jose Cuervo tequila, Malibu coconut rum, Fireball cinnamon whiskey, and both red and blue kamikazes. They didn't just win me over with their drink menu; their food options seemed diverse and delectable. I had just finished eating, but I had watched several other patrons, absolutely devour their tacos and burgers, and they look really good!!!\n\nThe ambiance is warm and welcoming, with rustic countertops, soft seating, and high ceilings that give a spacious feel to the intimate setting. One of the standout features was the partially open kitchen; it's always reassuring to see a clean and well-maintained culinary space. I saw staff constantly making aa cleanliness effort.\n\nTayanne was my server for most of the evening, and her friendly demeanour made me feel as if I was catching up with an old friend. Later, Vesa took over, ensuring the service quality remained impeccable. The presence of an attentive manager overseeing operations added an extra layer of professionalism.\n\nFor solo travellers like myself or anyone for that matter, this spot guarantees comfort and a fantastic dining experience. If you're out shopping at Marshalls, Sephora, or any nearby \"luxe\" stores and fancy a reasonably priced meal/snack or quick drink, I highly recommend this gem. It's a wonderful place to unwind, whether you choose the bar or a comfy table. Cheers to a memorable experience!",

The presence of an attentive manager overseeing operations added an extra layer of professionalism.\n\nFor solo travellers like myself or anyone for that matter, this spot guarantees comfort and a fantastic dining experience. If you're out shopping at Marshalls, Sephora, or any nearby \"luxe\" stores and fancy a reasonably priced meal/snack or quick drink, I highly recommend this gem. It's a wonderful place to unwind, whether you choose the bar or a comfy table. Cheers to a memorable experience!",

I came here to use my Plant Curious coupons, so ordered 2 vegan crepes (mango cream cheese and blueberry cream cheese), a gluten free classic pulled chick'un burger, and 3 chick'un tenders. There was only 1 lady working; she took the orders up front and prepared the food in the open kitchen space right behind the counter. We waited around 15 minutes for our order. When we went to pick up our food, one thing we did notice was that the staff member wasn't wearing gloves when handling the food, so we only trust that they were properly sanitizing in-between working up front and in the kitchen. She was friendly.\n\nThe chick'un tenders were the best part of the order. They had a crispy exterior and retained a meaty texture despite being vegan. The spices in the batter gave them a small kick of flavour. The crepes were disappointing, but because we got them at 2-for-1, it was fair for that price. We weren't sure if there was supposed to be more filling (\"cream cheese\") in-between the crepe folds, but it was primarily the fruit sauce on top that gave it flavour. The blueberry may have had a small amount of blueberry sauce inside, but there was no \"cream cheese\" to be found that we could see/taste. We were left wondering if it was mixed into the sauce. At a regular $10 each, we'd pass on this as it was otherwise a plain crepe with some sauce on top. The burger was decent and the vegan mayo and cheese options were appreciated. I only got the classic, so it was quite plain, but the chick'un had a soy-forward flavour that was passable as a meat substitute. The gluten free bun was one of the better buns I've had (fluffy and not flat).\n\nThe shop also sells different desserts (I'd assume made in house based on the packaging), and treats from other vendors and plant-based brands. Not everything is vegan, so I'd advise you to check the labels/menu and ask staff if you're unsure. If I was in the area, I'd recommend stopping by for the chick'un tenders or a treat as they're open late, but not for the crepes.",

I liked how they put some Rice Krispies to make it even crispier.  One star is removed because there is no washroom here. How are people going to wash their hands? And since it has a place to sit down, people might need to use the washroom, especially if they need to drink stuff. I would definitely try here though if you are vegan, vegetarian or if you just want to try some vegan chicken. The chickun burger was really my favorite.",

Oatmilk, banana, and syrup? That's not a milkshake....\n\nVegan presliced cake was okay.\n\nWe felt bad for the workers.

Just thinking about it makes me drool  When you take the first bite, you'd be surprised it's not real chicken. It's juicy and chewy and not dry at all! The times I've ordered here, it's always by phone. The staff are super friendly and know my name and order. They also have a huge selection of cakes all from the Cheesecake Factory so you can't go wrong! I've purchased their cakes before and if you're  into creamier, richer cakes, their selection will not disappoint.\n\nA must try for anyone vegetarian/vegan looking for a good chick'un burger and dessert.\n\nOnly down side is their pricing :( For just a burger alone, it's $14 +tax. I mean, the size of burger is actually quite big, but still a bit pricy for just a burger  Nonetheless, it is a place I frequent. So give it a try! :)",

They have an amazing happy hour and a great menu - it's hard to choose between so many of their wonderful dishes.\nLovely, helpful, and kind staff. Love coming here again and again! Favorites include beet salad and fried chicken. This was my first time getting their pizza and it was 10/10!",

They have an amazing happy hour and a great menu - it's hard to choose between so many of their wonderful dishes.\nLovely, helpful, and kind staff. Love coming here again and again! Favorites include beet salad and fried chicken. This was my first time getting their pizza and it was 10/10!",

I think we ordered 5 extra after.\n\nWe got the Indian donut they called it, that was warm and present. Not too sweet and one bite size. Mango kulfi was mangoy and creamy.

I had the crispy chicken special (recipe changes weekly) and this time it had truffle in it.  All the components that were in the sandwich from the house made bread to the sauce to the breaded chicken to the fresh greens inside were super fresh, and super tasty and flavourful. So many times a breaded chicken can easily be too dry or too salty but this was pure perfection. I also had a cruffin that had a delightfully light and fresh filling and an oat milk latte and both were also items I would come back for individually as well.  To absolutely nail it on all 3 items is a major feat, and truly a testament to this hole in the wall. Chef's kiss! Will absolutely be back.",

I really loved the ambience and the environment.\n\nMy family ordered ALL of the dishes (including all the starters, mains, and dessert, except for the specials) and everything was literally flawless. The dishes came out super fast, and the texture, flavourless, and display of the dishes was perfection. I could not pick out a single imperfection in any dish! I recommend everything, but especially the Chicken Fried Mitake, Summer's Bounty, Summer Bean Salad, BBQ Pork Collar, and Summer Strawberry dessert.\n\nThe cost is also way more affordable than other Michelins, and the portions are larger than other restaurants. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. We will definitely be coming here again!!!",

The highlight was definitely the first course, consisting of a selection of seven canapes, which were all fantastic. The weakest point was the last course, a somewhat insipid little cake bite (\"Douglas Fir malt crumb\"). All 10 of them really good quality dishes. We also tried the white wine they made in collaboration with Ursa Major winery. It was light, well rounded and very pleasant.\n\nA word on the pricing: the tasting menu is advertised as $165 per person, but when booking, in the very last step, right before paying, you'll notice there's a 20% service charge, which I found to be very misleading. With that plus tax, dinner for two came out to $412.50 (plus the wine, which I think came to about $20 per glass).\n\nThe service is very friendly. They explain all the dishes in great detail and are delighted to provide more insight. The one aspect that wasn't as enchanting is that as soon as we sat down, they tried to sell us additional options, like pre-selected wine paring, pre-selected wine and cocktail pairing, or just additional caviar or foie gras for our tasting menu, when we didn't even know what the menu was like, and without telling us the price for these add-ons upfront.\n\nOverall, great tasting experience, but for a hefty price.",

This dish had a nice tang to it, and the octopus was tender and bursting with flavour. The ingredients for all dishes were nice and fresh. Particularly, the tomatoes used in the ravioli tasted homegrown - a taste unique to only the highest quality tomato. Overall, I would describe the flavour notes of our dishes to be zesty citrus.\n\nOne minor thing that stuck out to me was the plating of the pork collar dish.

The service is wonderful they accommodated us just at closing time and they're really friendly and share books about the tragic history of Canadian First Nations. It's poignant reading about the owner's personal experience while reading through the menu. We ordered the upgrade to turn a main course into a 3 course meal. The first thing that hits you, literally in the gut, is how heavy the bannock is. It's so heavy and filling it could be a meal on its own. About the size of a large dinner roll with the weight of 7 of them. But it was surprisingly soft, natural tasting and great with butter. There was a beef and celery soup with so much shredded meat and celery it could have been a stew. Dipping bannock in it was great. We also had mushrooms and gravy on another large bannock. This was so good. The highlight was rubbed grilled salmon on wild rice. This was exceptional and we didn't finish it so we could share it with our daughter. Ice cream with berries was an excellent close. Let me not forget to mention 2 indigenous beers a vanilla porter that reminds you of a dark English beer and a Saskatoon berry that reminds you of a sour lager.",

Drinks (Berries gone wild, Elderflower refresher) are not that impressive too.\nI suggest not to order bannocks as starter as all main courses include a bannock with butter.  We ordered two toasted bannocks with sage-blueberries as starter and ended up eating a lot of bannocks!!\nIt's kind of disappointing for what we paid ($70+ per person). However, service and atmosphere is good.",

A friend and I wanted to try but weren't sure on the timing of when we'd be ready and so didn't make a reservation for Sunday, and we got really lucky - we called ahead and first they said they had room on the patio only, but then shortly after we arrived they'd had a cancellation so we did get a table inside. During the few minutes we were on the patio, though, they wanted to make sure we were comfortable and brought me a blanket since I was cold. But it was nice to sit inside to see all the art they have up.\nTo warm up, I got a wild rice tea (which is a caffeine-free infusion, not technically a tea), which was surprisingly rich-tasting. If you like genmaicha, this was a similar idea without the tea. For my meal, I had their vegetarian risotto, which rotates and was butternut squash on that day. My meal included a piece of bannock which they brought out first, which was like a cross between a dinner roll and rich biscuit and very good. Sometimes I find risotto boring, but this one was fantastic, with the rich earthy flavours of the risotto complimented by the seasoned roasted vegetables it was topped with. My friend was a fan of her salmon burger too, and said the bannock as a bun made it interesting and different. I tried one of her sweet potato fries and really liked it - more interesting than regular fries for sure. To finish, we ordered a blueberry bread pudding. I really like bread pudding but my friend had never tried it, but we both enjoyed it! The texture of the bannock in bread pudding was a little different but worked well!\nMy meal came to $57 after tip and tax, but it was well worth it for the nice experience I had (and I left full), and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to both foodies and people looking to get a taste of Indigenous culture.",

The price is reasonable with the amount of food you get. We had shaken beef, tamarind soup and fried chicken. They were all perfectly cooked, just a bit too sweet for my taste. The restaurant was super crowded when we came for dinner. Service was a bit slow, probably due to crowd, but the staffs were really nice. The restaurant has authentic Asian vibe with round family tables.",

I believe it was a chicken curry soup. I then ordered the Poutine with bacon and mushrooms. Very tasty! I loved how the place was right across the Gastown steam clock. So I was able to hear the steam go off while enjoying my meal and the view. If I ever come back to Vancouver, I will go out of my way to eat here again!",

After taking some of the usual tourist photos & waiting for the steam to blow the whistle, we found our way to the Black Frog Eatery. Settling in at 1 pm we were warmly welcomed and quickly seated. From our table we had an excellent view of the Steam Clock. I watched tourists posing with the clock as we awaited our order.\n\nWe weren't very hungry and decided to share a club sandwich.  I'm happy to say that it was made with real meat--none of that sliced processed poultry!  The fries were good too, and I washed it all down with a local award-winning Kokanee lager.\n\nThe ambiance of the Black Frog is definitely that of a pub-style eatery and the decor accentuates that feel.  That's a good thing, and to me, very comforting. Lot's of wood, brick, and pub-style elements all around. This is absolutely the type of place I'd have lunch at if I'd worked in the area.  Their menu has a good selection to satisfy everyone's tastes. Prices are on par with other restaurants offering similar fare.  The type of place that I call \"no nonsense and basic good eating\". Service was prompt, efficient, and the staff knew their menu well. When we find our way back to Vancouver, I will certainly plan on coming back.",

We went in after & a server with long blond hair asked us what we wanted to drink, we gave her our order. This place was rather small, so it shouldn't have taken 10 minutes to get our drinks. I noticed after 7 to 10 minutes, she came out of an alcove & went to her station, she forgot, it wasn't even busy! We got tired of waiting & decided to walk out. We went to the Blarney Stone pub, where a server got us drinks in under 5 minutes, much better service.\nMy suggestion, hire competent staff who are friendly & professional & know how to do their jobs!",

Met up with some friends who lives in Vancouver and recommend trying Maenam.\n\nCute small Thai restaurant with a very cool modern vibe. Service was excellent with the server being super attentive.\n\nWe decided to go for their 13 course tasting menu. I wasn't able to post all the pics as it only allows me to add 10 pics to this post.\n\nThe food was so amazing, small amounts so you can taste the flavours and also so you won't get too full.\nThe tasting menu was interesting there was food that I otherwise would not have ordered at a standard thai restaurant.  The server explained each dish that came to the table.\n\nAll in all a very unique experience, the desserts were so good!\nIn love tasting menus. This one is a must try!!",

The service lovely.  Come by with friends where the food will definitely be as good if not better than the company and conversation.\n\nI loved the vibe is family style and inviting, doesn't pretend to be super fancy where you can be comfortable to be you and still enjoy the flavours as it was meant.\n\nThank you for a memorable meal..I will definitely be back soon.",

The service lovely.  Come by with friends where the food will definitely be as good if not better than the company and conversation.\n\nI loved the vibe is family style and inviting, doesn't pretend to be super fancy where you can be comfortable to be you and still enjoy the flavours as it was meant.\n\nThank you for a memorable meal..I will definitely be back soon.",

We didn't expect to get fried fish at all and I'm so happy we did. It made the experience so unique and the fish was fried perfectly and tasted so delightful. At first I thought the pasta was pretty plain but it had great flavour! Definitely recommend the fish though I was glad we got that over a steak since steaks are so common at many tasting menus. Thank you for a great first time experience! Sorry my photos are terrible and I didn't get a photo of the appy and dessert.",

Love how they support local farmers and have unique high quality ingredients.\n\nWhen I was poor college student, I usually got the okonomiyaki or one of the stone bowls, one caterpillar roll, and 1 dessert and that was enough to satisfy me and my friend. I usually got something that was high in carbs that way it fills me up. That way it doesn't go over my budget.\n\nNow, I get anything from their special menu, it's always different depending on the seasons. I am never disappointed what I am about to taste.\n\nThe service is good and friendly!\n\nThe atmosphere there is calming, chill, classy. The music in that restaurant is very relaxing in my opinion.\n\nAlso, the tables are always clean and same with the dishes and cutlery.\n\nTip: This place is quite popular so the wait time to get a table might take long (1hr +). So I suggest you make a reservation, come at 5pm, or eat a small snack before you go but that depends on your eating schedule.",

I usually got something that was high in carbs that way it fills me up. That way it doesn't go over my budget.\n\nNow, I get anything from their special menu, it's always different depending on the seasons. I am never disappointed what I am about to taste.\n\nThe service is good and friendly!\n\nThe atmosphere there is calming, chill, classy. The music in that restaurant is very relaxing in my opinion.\n\nAlso, the tables are always clean and same with the dishes and cutlery.\n\nTip: This place is quite popular so the wait time to get a table might take long (1hr +). So I suggest you make a reservation, come at 5pm, or eat a small snack before you go but that depends on your eating schedule.",

The wait was worth it tho.\n\nWe ordered 2 kinds of oshi which were incredibly delicious but a bit smaller than I expected. Nonetheless, the flavour in each bite were amazing.\n\nThe veggie okonomiyaki was surprisingly good even if it's filled with just onions, cabbages and mushrooms.

The service is top notch, and the food is out of this world!! Tried the roast lamb..some of the best I've ever had!! The prices are really reasonable, too. Even the ambience is great. Can't wait to try the Sunday roast (on Sunday, obviously). This was my first time, sure won't be the last!!! (Also, drink specials are pretty amazing too!)",

Can't wait to try the Sunday roast (on Sunday, obviously). This was my first time, sure won't be the last!!! (Also, drink specials are pretty amazing too!)",

The wooden interior is cozy and I feel like the decor is evoking a little bit genuine nostalgic feel and also a little humour. Our waiter was super nice and the other staff was also friendly. Walking to the washroom takes you right past the kitchen, which is interesting to take a look at but also may give some peace of mind that you can easily see exactly what's going on in there.\nTheir menu is mostly the basic Thai dishes that you see at casual Thai restaurants in Canada, but I was really curious about their take on fish & chips and poutine, which sounded very unique compared to both other Thai food and the Canadian versions of these dishes. So this time I tried Bob's Fish & Chips: fried battered cod pieces topped with sliced mango, onion, basil, and chilies with two crispy curry rice cakes, in a tangy sauce. It's not a dish you'd recognize as fish & chips without the context, but I can see where the inspiration was drawn from. I thought it was really tasty! The vinegar sauce was zippy and refreshing and I really liked the flavour and crunchy \"crust\" of the rice balls. When I first got a look at it I was skeptical that it was really enough food to be worth $22, but the way they stacked the fish pieces was deceiving because there was actually a lot of fish, and I was fully satiated after finishing. I also tried their house tamarind ginger soda which was very good too! I was expecting it to be spicy like ginger beer and it was really mostly sweet because the tamarind is more pronounced than the ginger, but still a tasty and refreshing drink.\nMy friend got the Chicken Cashew Nut for her meal and enjoyed it as well. There was enough that she ate only half and saved the rest (although she's not a big eater - I think with my appetite I could've finished it or nearly finished it but been very full).\nI'd say it's a safe bet for standard downhome Thai food, and if you want to get a little experimental, the Fish & Chips is definitely worth trying. The positive atmosphere ties it all together.",

Both noodles were very flavourful and the soup was the perfect balance of sour and spicy. All dishes had a good serving of prawn which were well sized. Also had a Thai iced tea which was refreshing and was the perfect level of sweetness.\n\nService was also amazing - they were attentive, responsive, and quick to do the small things like remove chopstick/straw wrap from the table and bring take out containers.\n\nI definitely recommend Bob Likes Thai Food, and will go again!",

The Hamburger is the main dish we tried and while a good burger (BTW it's served medium well so it's very pink inside) it was over powered by the strong and sharp cheese flavours.    I would consider asking them for some kind of modifications to make it a little more impressive in some way.     The chairs have some weird construction with the metal braces that hold the legs together that protrude and could damage leggings and general is a annoying\n\nOverall enjoyable, fancy and very pleasant.",

The Hamburger is the main dish we tried and while a good burger (BTW it's served medium well so it's very pink inside) it was over powered by the strong and sharp cheese flavours.    I would consider asking them for some kind of modifications to make it a little more impressive in some way.     The chairs have some weird construction with the metal braces that hold the legs together that protrude and could damage leggings and general is a annoying\n\nOverall enjoyable, fancy and very pleasant.",

I don't know who chooses them or how much money a bar has to pay to be on them, but most of the time, it doesn't seem to match with my experiences.\n\nBotanist, however, does belong on that list. Is it the best cocktail bar ever? No. But it is an exceptionally good hotel bar? Yes.\n\nArguably, hotel bars have a much more difficult task than a regular cocktail bar because they have to appeal to a much wider range of tastes, people, and experiences. Generally, they're fairly generic, and play it safe with flavours, never straying too far from trends or accessibility of the most inexperienced tourist.\n\nThat's why Botanist is special. Sure, sitting at the bar, I saw people be boring and order Aperol Spritzes and wines and espresso martinis.  But the cocktail menu is so much more. It's big, for one thing. Has a great deal of diversity. You can find any sort of drink from a fizzy, sweet concoction to a serious spirit-forward sipper.\n\nWhat I enjoyed most was the marriage of very BC/Canadian ingredients with spirits, some of which are fairly rare to find on a hotel bar cocktail list. Both that I tried were delicious, and mostly important for me, you can actually taste and feel the booze. Sure, one of them (Council of Trees -- amazing name!) seemed pretty juicy and easy, but you could *feel* it by the last sip. What a sneaky drink. I loved it. That's what I'm looking for: cool flavours, mixed and balanced so well that I barely can tell it's a cocktail but hits hard enough that I don't say, \"Well, I could have just ordered a lemonade.\" Don't get me wrong, you can taste the interesting scotch, but it wasn't too much or too little. I'm going to be honest: I saw the Council of Trees on their menu online weeks ahead of time when planning my trip and knew I had to try it. I adored the botanical ingredients, and even its little cryptic blurb on the menu. If nothing else, I was going to try it. And it did not disappoint.\n\nThe second cocktail (Stone Fox) was a lot heavier, and very spirit-forward, which I appreciate on a cocktail menu. Especially hotels. As a cognac lover, I had to try it. It was a little heavy on the sweet apricot for me personally, but a lot of people would like it this way.\n\nShout out to the great bar snacks, too. They do not skimp. It was almost like a tapa, that's how much you get and it's good quality too.\n\nBartenders were sociable but not overbearing and seemed to nail the choices for other patrons. The bar area itself is small, and not exactly the coziest as it's right in the corridor leading from the entrance to the restaurant, but if you're only having a drink or two, it's totally fine. Hostess was super-nice and accommodating.\n\nWould definitely come back.",

The spicy plantain margaritas were amazing - our server added a special touch for us, so that made us feel pretty special. The staff were all so kind. After we left, we went back for dancing later.

Had a reservation through open table app for 7:45.\nFirst impression: The place was mostly empty, after a brief miscommunication with the hostess (she couldn't read our name on the reservation so she brought the tablet to us to identify ourselves lol), we got taken down the steps and seated at our table. Cosy atmosphere, chill-vibes, we were really hungry so got to ordering right away. I asked for the iconic red stripe (Jamaican beer), was told that they didn't have any in stock. I opted for the rum punch. And boy was it punching! I couldn't finish mine, I found it too strong. Not a downfall on the barman, I'm just not really a rum person. We ordered spicy beef patties and jerk pork belly for starters, and curry goat meal and oxtail dinner for mains.\nFirst impressions experience: 8/10\n\nPatties: you get two with a choice of dip. The pastry was crisp and flaky, very light and enjoyable, the filling was plenty full, but not spicy at all. In fact I think it could've done with more seasoning. Overall - 8/10.\n\nJerk pork belly: oh lord! Sooooo goood! Good size portion for a starter (2 pieces), drenched in tropical salsa type sauce and served with 4 fried dumplings. I thought the dumplings were a little hard (the outer layer was too fried and hard), but overall good. The pork belly was well seasoned and definitely a highlight of the starters.\nOverall 9/10.\n\nCurry goat: comes in an old school lunchbox style containers, accompanied by rice and peas (peas were white though), and a green leaf salad mix. The goat was well cooked, falling off the bone, juicy, tender, but also, a little mild on the seasoning. Not much curry flavour coming through.\nOverall 7/10.\n\nOxtail: generally my absolute favorite Jamaican dish, unfortunately just like the curry goat, under seasoned. Very well cooked, comes off the bone completely as it should, no issues there, but lacks the authentic flavour that would be enhanced had the seasoning been portioned into the stew properly.\nOverall 6/10.\n\nService: attentive, friendly, smiling staff, no complaints at all.\nOverall 10/10",

This neighbourhood has significantly declined and there is barely any lighting - you have to know about this place to find it. The Dark and Stormy ($15) has ginger beer which I love, perfectly sweetened. My jerk chicken was moist but the flavour fell flat. There was almost enough sauce to mix with the rice (it'd be bland without sauce, which I think is normal for many cuisines!). Those were nothing to write home about, it was the fried plantain that was REALLY tasty; wish I had more than 2 slices. Overall, thought this was pricey for the quality and flavours. The server was sweet but couldn't remember if she took my order, and walked away before I could get my receipt. Notes: auto 20% gratuity for big groups. The basement turns into a dance floor at 10:30pm, so book in advance for resos close to that time. My friend recommended the coconut dumplings, which sound odd but I might try them next time I want to walk through DTES in the dark!",

We had early reservations which you'll need to make at least a month in advance. We sat at the bar which had great ambiance. The staff did an amazing job of the small details and with the dishes. The charcoal udon was just so incredible. Out of the 6 dishes we got, the only one I did not enjoy as much was the salmon. It wasn't bad but I just found it not at the same level as the other dishes. Still for me five !",

On the plus side, the charcoal pasta had a wonderful bounce to it, the duck breast was the tenderest I've ever had (much better than French style), and the tiramisu was seriously good. I would've got a second order if we weren't so stuffed. Cocktails and the citrus-infused sake were superb. Great place to try at least once.\n\nTip for photographers: if you are taking daytime photos, ask for the corner table by the window when you book. It's one of the best spots for bright natural light.",

Walk-ins are possible but fill up quick. Paid street parking is available and relatively cheap (couple of dollars for the 2-3h duration we were there).\n\nDefinitely a nice experience and worth trying at least once if you get the chance, but it is quite pricey.

Simply Delicious is lower then average Japanese food..... East Van Banh mi over priced vietnamese subs that are at best sub par for double the price.  And Saigon Secrets come on....\n\nAtmosphere not the greatest.   Service was somewhat good, I mean the servers hounding you every 3 minutes to see if you want to order  more.   Food quality not good.  Expect better then this in Vancouver.  Can get 100 times better Banh mi for 1/3 the price all across Vancouver.  Sushi meh.....  Pho, price vs quality... I dont know was pretty disappointed.  Honestly first time i think a restaurant has over charged me on my bill",

Simply Delicious is lower then average Japanese food..... East Van Banh mi over priced vietnamese subs that are at best sub par for double the price.  And Saigon Secrets come on....\n\nAtmosphere not the greatest.   Service was somewhat good, I mean the servers hounding you every 3 minutes to see if you want to order  more.   Food quality not good.  Expect better then this in Vancouver.  Can get 100 times better Banh mi for 1/3 the price all across Vancouver.  Sushi meh.....  Pho, price vs quality... I dont know was pretty disappointed.  Honestly first time i think a restaurant has over charged me on my bill",

I had the opportunity to try their veggie samosas, which were crispy on the outside and filled with a flavorful mixture of potatoes and spices on the inside. They were simply amazing and left me wanting more.\n\nI also had the chance to taste their fries, which were equally as delicious as the samosas. They were crispy and perfectly seasoned, making for a great side dish to the samosas.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend We Grill to anyone looking for tasty and authentic Indian cuisine in Vancouver.

The entrance is on the burrard side. You climb a set of stairs to get to the second floor venue. Watch out on the way in or you will end up in the tattoo shop underneath.\n\nWe shared a tequila lime Margherita which was excellent.\n\nFor dinner we had tried a quesadea platter of 3, a taco Platter of 3, and an enchiladas dish.\n\nThe quesadea we had chicken, beef, and pulled pork. This was excellent and our favorite dish.\n\nThe soft tacos were tasty and good size  we had a beef taco, and 2 different types of pork. They were good but not as good as the quesedia.\n\nFinally we shared the enchiladas. Which came with 3 as well as rice and beans. These were chicken and were a touch dry. The green sauce was ok but this dish was on the bland side.\n\nThe service was ok and the venue was large and clean. We went on a Sunday around 7pm. The place was half full. The food came out quick and the staff gave us everything we needed.\n\nThe place had a fairly large menu and it looks like they do large families or parties well.\n\n$$",

Most of the menu items feature their homemade blue corn tortillas and there's a great selection of traditional cacao drinks (hot and iced) - stuff that I don't think you can find anywhere else in the city. So I was very curious to try, and decided to take my parents here while they were visiting because my dad requested \"Mexican food\". Because this is not your typical Mexican food I wasn't sure if it would be what they had in mind, but it was a hit with all of us and my dad even said it might be the best Mexican food he's ever had.\nI got the chihatl to drink and the itacates de flor de calabaza for my meal. My first time trying chihatl, first time trying itacates, and first time trying pumpkin blossom in any form, and everything was amazing. Even though the chihatl was served icy it was still a \"warming\" drink with the cinnamon spice. The frothed texture was really cool. Very unique taste. The itacates are probably best described as Mexican samosas, but the tortillas are not deep-fried which keeps them soft. The tortilla and bean filling had an earthy flavour which paired perfectly with the flor de calabaza (I had no expectation to what pumpkin blossom would taste like but it surprisingly was very similar to pumpkin flesh). The waiter brought 3 sauces to the table for us: pico de gallo, a dark and sweet salsa roja, and a spicy salsa verde. The sauces were all delicious (I could've eaten the roja with a spoon) but almost unnecessary as the food was so tasty even without that it felt a shame to do anything to cover it up.\nMy parents had the Huarache Nopal and Machete Pollito and were, needless to say, very happy with those, but I didn't try them. I did try my dad's hot chocolate, which is great if you're not so adventurous since it basically just tasted like a really high quality but \"mainstream\" hot choc. Also note the drinks are served in bowls made from large dried gourd husks(?) which provides a unique drinking experience.\nThe prices are really fair for what you're getting. The total for our party (3 entrees and 2 drinks) came to about $75 before tip.\nThe place is small and really cozy, and while the staff wasn't the most outgoing, they were polite and seemed to really care to make sure we were enjoying everything. I would really recommend this place for a truly different Mexican dining experience.",

However, the linguine with sufretto sauce was very tasty. The grilled sea bass was great, and I don't eat fish. Food rated at 4.3, service at 4.6. Sorry no pics of main dishes, too busy eating.",

However, making a reservation through Google Maps was not possible, as the dates and times were never available. We eventually booked directly from the restaurant's homepage, where we had to pay a $25 deposit per person. Surprisingly, the restaurant wasn't as busy as we initially anticipated, and it seemed like walking in without a deposit would have been fine. As for the food, it was generally good. We ordered a variety of dishes, including cured meat, cheese, pasta, and beef skewers, which were served in sampler-sized plates. The pasta had a chewy texture, while the salad served alongside the beef skewers lacked thoughtful presentation. The dessert doughnuts could use some improvement in terms of presentation, but they were deliciously chewy. The service was polite, although it felt a bit awkward. Overall, the experience was okay.",

The one cocktail we ordered was good but they make it in house ahead of time and bottle it, so not my ideal drink but still was very good.\n\nHave a small patio that is awesome and inside decor is nice too.

Despite this not being a standard menu item, Connie, who provided impeccable service, went above and beyond to convey my requests to Johnny. Without hesitation, they not only fulfilled but also surpassed all my culinary expectations.\n\nHaving worked in the restaurant industry during my young adulthood and even having had an 8-year connection to a Greek family, my standards are exceptionally high. The chicken was impeccably moist and flavorful, while the spanakopita boasted a perfectly flaky exterior with a delectably moist and delicious filling. I requested a little extra tzatziki, and Connie promptly delivered it with a welcoming smile.\n\nIn summary, my dining experience at Johnny's on Oak was nothing short of delectable, and I left thoroughly satisfied. The combination of superb food, exceptional service, and the willingness to accommodate unique requests truly made this visit unforgettable.",

We would like to explain what happened.\n\nThe first is peanuts. You all ordered papaya salad. And your boyfriend has asked for peanuts for it but in the recipe we don't have it on the menu. which we have given You go for a small cup of peanuts. and you have asked for more which we have refused Because it is something that is not in the recipe. 2. For iced coffee The shop is sure that we can make iced coffee without ice. But that day you asked us to make hot coffee for you. It wasn't on the menu so we declined. However, I think there has been a misunderstanding in this communication. and the shop would like to inform you that In fact, the shop has announced that they will do take out only from September 5th. Thank you very much.",

We ordered the Pad Si Ew Moo Grob (rice sheet noodles with crispy pork) and Chuchi Pla Tod (creamy coconut curry with crispy basa fillets). Both were so much more flavourful than I expected, and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and presentation. The basa fillets and pork were perfectly crispy. I'd definitely recommend both dishes, though if I had to pick a must-try item, it'd be the Chuchi Pla Tod for sure.\n\nThe place is small with little seating and an open kitchen. I came in the summer and there wasn't much foot traffic, so sitting outside was actually enjoyable. The waitress came out to check in on us quite often (most of their customers seem to sit outside) and refilled our water frequently.\n\nIt's about $25-$35 per person, which is on the higher end of price, but was so worth it for the food, quantity was decent too. I would definitely recommend and will be back myself to show this place to other friends.",

Highly recommend the waffle with White chocolate sauce!",

So I was solo and of course I was seated in the bar counter area. I could see the Michelin guide sign in front of me. The clerk was very busy moving around. You can see how popular this place is. I had a warm latte with lavender added. Next I chose two famous Liege style waffles topped with milk chocolate lavender and mixed berries compote. I guess I expected too much. The clerk was busy and didn't give much service. The expected waffles were not very warm and small size. The topping sauce was smooth and flavorful. I look forward to the next time and want to visit again.",

So I was solo and of course I was seated in the bar counter area. I could see the Michelin guide sign in front of me. The clerk was very busy moving around. You can see how popular this place is. I had a warm latte with lavender added. Next I chose two famous Liege style waffles topped with milk chocolate lavender and mixed berries compote. I guess I expected too much. The clerk was busy and didn't give much service. The expected waffles were not very warm and small size. The topping sauce was smooth and flavorful. I look forward to the next time and want to visit again.",

Though the service was a bit slow, everyone was very friendly and welcoming.\n\nI loved that you can mix and max different souvlaki. I've never seen this option before. Though I was a bit disappointed with the salmon (a bit bland tasting) and wished I went with my original choice of two prawns. Those were very flavourful and cooked perfectly! The rice was a bit watery. I loved the veggies on the side. The souvlaki meal didn't come with pita, which was a first at a Greek place!\n\nThe ambiance was good. Decor was nice. The music was a bit too loud. Good experience overall, but not quite 5 stars.",

A safe bet overall for everyone in a group. We were a group of four and one of us had a more strict diet restriction. I ordered the Classic Benedict, which would be better if it came with more sauce.\n\nThey had Mighty Leaf for tea, which was one of the best tea bag brand you could find at grocery store. It was a pleasant surprise.\n\nOur server seemed to have a bad day and struggled a bit.

My burger was great - substantial and very tasty. My companion's was underwhelming, underdressed and with a squished, soggy bun.

Its a tad small, but very refreshing. Service was very nice and attentive.\n\nI hear great stuff about their brunch, but only made it for their dinner and happy hour menu. I found that the portions were very small for the price. The mac and cheese wasn't creamy enough and the brisket it came with were small- did not justify the $30 price tag. The \"shareable\" lobster dish was delicious, but not at all shareable. I don't recommend the foie gras parfait, that was not pleasant.",

Every piece was crispy and even after it cooled, they didn't become soggy. The Maxine's Bacon were thick cut bacon with a slightly sweet taste. They also have regular bacon as an add on if you prefer savoury bacon.\n\nThey don't take reservations for brunch and their peak hours are around 11am to 1:30pm. If you're a party of 2, you'll be seated relatively quickly. Larger groups will be a longer wait as most of their tables seat 2-4 people. They also don't have an indoor waiting area so I wouldn't recommend coming on a rainy day if you don't want to wait in the rain.",

After eating so much along the walk through Robson, it was nice to see a venue offer quick bites to have a taste of their menu!! Pay and order first and then pick up, enjoy at a table for 2 since it's a small restaurant and then clean up your table after and place trays in designated area. Simple and easy. The tako bombs were pretty good but it definitely needed some hot sauce so we bought some for about $0.30Cad not bad but usually it's a free condiment for us. It definitely brought out the flavors! The karage chicken was also a good find! If I had room in my tummy I would have grabbed some spam musubi!! Looked good!!",

The presentation of the food was too pretty to not capture the memory and everything else about the meal and drinks was above average.  Even their grapefruit juice was better than I've had and noteworthy!\n\nHaving our server interact with us throughout the entire meal added to the fun.  He even sat with us for a few minutes for conversation as he cheered us on to try our first ever pickle back.\n\nGreat experience and a shout out to our camera shy server that we would ask for by name if only I could remember it!",

They have some cool rolling windows which they opened and that helped a bit. The food and service way outweighed the issues with the location. Highly reccomend!",

The decor is modern, and the view is spectacular, especially because we went right as the sun set. Each dish is comfortably shared amongst 3 people, unless stated differently. The flavors are so fresh and bold. Make sure to order as much bread as you need to complete the dips and sauces. I went with a group of 10 people and spent roughly $60 per person, with 2 bottles of wine and there were left overs that we split amongst ourselves. Large groups are too big for the venue but they were so lovely by accommodating us.  The service really helped make this place stand out. This place is a great date or venue to bring your best friends, best suited for groups of 4 to 6.

                    "review_text": "Yasma is a lovely little gem in coal harbour, slightly tucked away, just off of West Georgia right by the marina. The decor is modern, and the view is spectacular, especially because we went right as the sun set. Each dish is comfortably shared amongst 3 people, unless stated differently. The flavors are so fresh and bold. Make sure to order as much bread as you need to complete the dips and sauces. I went with a group of 10 people and spent roughly $60 per person, with 2 bottles of wine and there were left overs that we split amongst ourselves. Large groups are too big for the venue but they were so lovely by accommodating us.  The service really helped make this place stand out. This place is a great date or venue to bring your best friends, best suited for groups of 4 to 6. So don't dress too casual here, it's definitely a place to look a bit more polished when you arrive.",

Very authentic and delicious food all the way from Syria and Lebanon, freshly made and tasting like nothing you ever tried before. Nice choice of salads, small mezze plates to share and something for everyone's taste. Several nice vegetarian and vegan options as well. Strongly recommend Fattoush Salad, which is just delicious, hummus is next level, fresh and yummy, and don't get me started on freshly baked pita bread. Place gets very busy on weekends, so make sure to make a booking, although if you are alone or couple, if you are lucky - you may get seated at the bar to admire amazing skills of bartender Anka, who is just doing magic there and  is very helpful and offers great advice. If you love Mediterranean food you'll be in heaven.",

We ordered the Tartufina pizza and it was DELICIOUS! It is such an interesting flavor between the honey roasted walnuts and the Gorgonzola cheese. The sweetness of the honey wasn't overpowering it just gave it a unique flavor at the end of the bite. I would 100% go back just for this pizza.\n\nThe ambiance is so cozy and elegant yet funky inside. If it wasn't too hot, the patio would be a great option too, full of plants and it seemed like a spacious comfortable space.",

Jose's service was great, even though it was a super busy night, but like in a good Italian restaurant I loved how we were not rushed and enjoyed our time. We hit yo try the crab tower, which I wouldn't have expected but flavor was incredible! One of the best Carpaccio's I've ever had, being one of my favorite Italian dishes and have had in many places and countries! flavor was absolutely on point, antipasto was excellent in every bite, followed by a fantastic and light Gnocchi with white sauce. I wish we had space to try the creme brulee, but we did take a Tiramisu to go and didn't disappoint! Atmosphere was lovely, restaurant was beautiful! It truly made our night in Vancouver, wish we could come back tomorrow but it was fully booked as well. Thank you so much! ",

The Volume of cheese used in the burger was appropriate and the price of burger was a bit expensive. There were also some large french fries on the side, which were good.\n\nIt was served in a stainless steel dish, which I didn't like very much, but it's definitely better than a plastic container in my opinion.

In that hour and 30min of wait time, unless you're just gonna sit there, you're gonna end up ordering something light to drink and eat. That's how they get ya to spend more. The portion is like a kids' meal. What a scam!! All that waiting, we get a size of a cereal bowl portion? Restaurant should be called Como get scammed\n\nResponse: so you don't take taxes and tips into consideration? That's why I said 40. Yea we did see the process but yes it still took more than an hour for the plate to arrive on my table. Check your camera (I'll even bet you money for it). Funny how you don't respond about the portion size, just like everyone else who left the reviews. Maybe I'll come to the competition and help you remove some dirt out of your eyes, scammer.",

The other 180 people that came had a great time, and the small business we collab with does an amazing job. To be clear, it's $28, and the actual people who cook the Paella do it traditionally, so it takes an hour. If you are still hungry after this...don't know what to tell you... They also take pictures with everyone and show how it's done. We offer food and drinks while guests are waiting, how dare we. Good things come to those who wait, not for those who prob just want to take a picture and leave. PS, the crew from Paella Guys are competing in the world championships this year ",

Too much juicy meat, too much of the crispiest bacons I ever had, too much of the peanut butter, not even thinking to try to stay between the patties. Overall it wasn't the best burger I ever had, but a very good one. The poutine on the other hand really kicked in. I've never tried it that way, the chaos of flavor was a special treatment for my tounge, in a great way.\n\nThe girls working here are very kind and also handling situations with a \"I believe it's real\" smile. Nothing to complain here.\n\nIf I ever come back to Vancouver again, this will be on my bucket list for sure.

Their specialty burgers are the highlight. However, their soups, fries and drinks are also really nice.\n\nThe staff were very friendly and attentive. Plexiglass is installed and covid procedures well-followed. I felt welcomed and safe and enjoyed an awesome lunch. It's local and family-owned. The area was very clean.\n\nAlso tried their spaghetti and curry on another occassion -- both are also quite nice when you are craving for something different. I can't wait to go back to try the entire menu.",

It's one of the BEST (if not the best) spot in town for chicken. Generous portions, great combination of flavors and very very friendly stuff. I freaking loved it!\n\nIn terms of the actual restaurant, it's not anything extraordinary but more of like a grab and go place, with a few stands if you wanna dine in. Nothing wrong with it tho, will definitely visit again soon!",

Yes it's hard to find parking, minimal seating, sometimes lengthy waits, expensive (compared to what though? It's Vancouver) but it's so worth it. The fried chicken is always juicy and perfecy seasoned, the skin is so crispy. The pickles are seasoned too and it's so good. If you just get chicken to go, they'll put it on bread to absorb the oil which is genius. The crinkle cut fries are delicious and I like to alternate between ketchup and DL sauce. Because of the price, this is more of a big scheduled treat than a convenient stop for me but I look forward to it!",

The chicken is juicy, tender, and very flavourful - the best chicken sandwich I have ever tasted. The fries have a special spice craveable to the palate.  Their in-house DL sauce is super yummy. Both the sandwich and fries are huge portions.\n\nStaffs are friendly, service is excellent. Limited indoor/outdoor seating space. Be ready for a long queue.   Street parking can be a challenge. Will definitely be back. Try Downlow Chicken Shack, you can't go wrong.",

Clearly it was not freshly cooked.\n\nAnother disappointing fact was that they do not have any tempura sushi options.\n\nOverall, this place should be avoided if you are in search of good tasty food.\n\nOnly reason for not giving 1 star is the service.

Located in the West End, down a set of stairs off Davie St, Arike is an approachable and global dining experience.\n\nEvery course had a remarkable variance in spice and heat, even the bread which contained bebere spice. My favourite courses were the Moroccan Ratatouille and the Sea Bream Ceviche. The ceviche was notably spicy, in a delightful way, and presented with a peanut hummus. I also had the wine pairing which was a stellar accompaniment.\n\nMy sister found the melon course with the serrano sofrito and yogurt foam as her favourite.\n\nThe meal was a wonderful progression from start to finish and we were delighted by it all.",

My kids have tried pizza and pasta before and approved the quality. I was a bit disappointed, one for tiger prawns appetizer because they were small shrimps and another for Roast lamb. Rice under the lamb way completely cold (I didn't sent it back since already had started eating the lamb before trying the rice but main reason is just don't like to send my food back). The portion seemed a bit smaller than before but it was enough for me. The price is low compare to most other restaurants but that might be the reason of a bit drop on quality.

The rice pilaf wasn't the best I've had - could've used more flavour and unfortunately it was cold. However, the lamb and potato were warm so it was fine to eat with the rice. They also served free pita bread which came out hot and fresh and great with the Tzatziki.\n\nGreat patio setting, I like that they have the plastic barriers up to separate the tables - it makes it more intimate and quiet. The place was packed on a Saturday night and they only had three servers. Waited about 15 min for a table at 8pm and many people were stopping in for pizza take out. Table service was a bit slow but our service did a great job and was friendly.",

It's heavily seasoned (which I prefer) and was fresh from the fryer--very juicy. However, for the amount I paid, I expected a somewhat larger portion but given the location, it makes sense. If you're looking for more bang for your buck, I would recommend giving 'Wow Full Noodle House' a try!

The pork itself was very fatty which I liked but the flavour was somewhat one dimensional. They are very generous with the portions here.\nThe chicken nuggets with noodles in soup was also generous in price. Lots of noodles. The soup was plain but enjoyable as it off balanced the fried chicken. The fried chicken was okay. Not crispy enough and also not juicy enough.\nThe food was mediocre overall. Not too pricey but not cheap either.\nService wise - food came out a bit slow as it was busy but servers are nice and don't rush you even though it's busy.\nI saw the tables around me and they were all eating rice and noodles dishes.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you and your wife faced during your recent visit. We take customer feedback seriously and would like to address this matter.\n\nFirst and foremost, we're deeply sorry for any misunderstanding regarding the counting of the payment.  This certainly does not reflect our usual standard of service. To ensure it doesn't happen again in the future, I have investigated and found out some details. As you noted, there was quite a bit of coin so there might have been a miscount somewhere. In hindsight, the staff agreed that he could have done differently to avoid upsetting you.  He admitted that he was also under pressure that the store was busy with other guests waiting to be served.\n\nWe highly value our customers, and it's disappointing to hear that you had a negative experience. We would like to make amends for this. Kindly reach out to our management team with your phone number at feedback@thaiaway.com so we can resolve this matter to your satisfaction.\n\nOnce again, we apologize for the inconvenience, and we hope you'll give us another chance to provide you with the excellent dining experience we strive to offer.\n\nSincerely,\nSiripon\nThai away home restaurant",

My husband and I were already talking about what to order on our next visit as soon as we got into our car after the meal.\n\nThere were 5 of us tonight and we had:\n\n1. Deep fried meat dumplings - meaty fillings in crispy wrappings.\n\n2. Seafood and green onion pancakes - it was the best Korean seafood pancake we've had in Vancouver. The dough was light but it was filled with seafood goodness. The outside was perfectly fried with crunchy and crispy edges.\n\n3. Beef short ribs in sweet soy sauce - The flavour of the dish rendered it as my mom's favourite. The meat was tender and charred to perfection.\n\n4. Plain pork belly - This was my favourite. All the pieces were also charred nicely and they were heavenly with the accompanying dipping condiment (salt and spices in oil).\n\nService was excellent. The staff were friendly and attentive.\n\nI love this place.",

Featured here:\n\nBibimbap\nHaemul Soondubu\nHaemul Pajeon (Seafood and Green Onion Pancake)\nSweet Rice Drink\n\nBibimbap is usually served sizzling hot in a stone bowl. The rice at the bottom gets crunchy, and the whole dish in general tends to be a very warm, hearty and comforting meal. This Bibimbap however, was served to me in a metal bowl. Not only did it come in a metal bowl, but the rice was served separately from the veggies and fried egg, in a smaller separate bowl. This was really quite a disappointment as I'd been looking forward to have the sizzling hot bowl of rice that I'd come to expect from Korean restaurants.\n\nThe Haemul Soondubu on the other hand arrived at the table with bubbling hot soup in it. This was my second choice and I really wish that I had ordered this instead.\n\nThe Haemul Pajeon was nicely done, and the sweet rice drink which I hadn't had for a number of years, was as tasty as I remembered it being.\n\nThere were other meat dishes on the table but people started eating before I could take any photos! The meat dishes were already prepared though. This wasn't the kind of Korean BBQ where you get to cook the food yourself on a grill. That was a bit of a disappointment as we'd brought an out of town visitor here, and had hoped to give him the experience of Korean BBQ cooking at this dinner. From the name of the restaurant, we thought there would be grills on our table, but...that wasn't the case.\n\nService: Good\nParking: Free parking on the side street\nLocation: 2408 Nanaimo St., Vancouver, BC",

Highly recommend the Sweet Soy Deung Galbi Jjim. Excellent flavour and the meat just fell off the bone. The Ddukbokki was a bit disappointing this time. It was too soft and mushy, not the chewy texture I was hoping for. Overall, this is a great restaurant in an area with not many Korean food options. I would recommend it!",

If everyone at the table gets a dish worth $9 or more then you get unlimited rice, miso soup, and salad. Which is great because their salad is so good as is their dressing and really gives your palate a break/reset from the deep fried foods that is your main meal. We got a side of curry because katsu and curry is just a perfect combination and if you've never poured curry over your katsu before, definitely recommend it!",

The food was so fresh, tasted delicious, and I don't think we had to wait too like despite it being quite busy. We ordered 1 rosu katsu ($25), 1 rosu curry ($28), and 2 cheese katsus ($26.50 for one order). Although this place is quite pricey, it's worth it for the experience and the quality and amount of food. The cheese katsu is quite rich, the rosu curry is quite flavourful, and the breading of all of the katsus were amazing!\n\nWe highly recommend coming here, but DON'T FORGET TO MAKE A RESERVATION/BE PUT ON THE WAITING LIST ONLINE, because it's super busy once it opens, and you'll have to wait 30+ minutes if you don't have one.",

The little mini mall has a busy parking lot but you can usually find street parking (both free and paid).\n\nWe've been here a few times to grab a quick bbq lunch combo. But we finally visited for dine-in recently. In addition to their bbq service, they have a full Chinese seafood menu offering.\n\nWe ordered the 3 item bbq combo (you pick and choose which bbq items you want but we opted for the roast pork, bbq, and soya sauce chicken). While the bbq price is higher than the lunch combos, you get more meat. Not a bad price when you consider how much the price of bbq duck has gone up lately. The duck was good... meaty and juicy. Roast pork has nice crispy skin. A welcome addition to the area for bbq.\n\nPea tips were good too. And I like that we received complimentary soup to start and green bean soup for dessert.\n\nReally want to come back here and try some of their seafood combos.\n\nUpdate: We did return in October to try a dinner combo with a 2lb lobster sticky rice with 2 bbq items plus 1 other dish for $118 (we picked the sole fillets with veggies). We also added the Taiwanese cauliflower with lap cheung and bacon. Again, you get complimentary soup and dessert. Bbq items were as good as before.",

We asked for hot n sour, but the server brought the daily soup instead. When asked why, she then said the combo soup has to be daily soup.\n\nI found the BBQ pork and duck very tasty and not too oily. The green beans w minced pork were perfectly crispy but not too deep-fried. Again, very tasty. Didn't care for the daily soup, as it's just a thin broth w few veggies + few pieces of meat.

The chicken inside the sandwich was juicy, crunch and well seasoned. The sauce and the slaw worked really well together. We ordered the OG hot chicken, hot and sweet honey garlic, and kids tenders. I personally liked the honey garlic sandwich more but the OG was also really tasty. Waffles fries were great too with a good portion size. Their house mayo was also delicious. Most of all, the lady who received our order was  so kind, attentive and friendly. The service was beyond 10/10. She even came to check how our food was and also to kindly interact with our son. Such a sweet gesture. The only criticism I have was that it was a bit cold in the restaurant. Got a tall can of beer with the chicken sammy, and this meal was so satisfying. Definitely going on my favourite restaurant list.",

As we were being seated we were asked where we are from and they confirmed that it was a special occasion. The exceptional service continued throughout the evening. The food was exquisite. Vegan fare rarely rises to such heights. Attention was paid to presentation, flavor combinations, and textures. The Beet tartar and the chickpea tofu stood out to my mind, but nothing was wanting. The desserts were luscious. The chocolate layer cake with crunchy bottom, orange gelee, and a sprinkle of salt to heighten the senses was, like the rest of the meal a delight for the eyes and senses on multiple levels. The pear tart was perfectly cooked with the fruit holding it's shape and texture, not too sweet, with a touch of cinnamon. I enjoyed a non-alcoholic beer and an NA gin and tonic that were recommended and I would gladly order again. My partner really enjoyed her whiskey cocktail (with alcohol) and her recommended glass of white wine. We will happily be back.",

The only dish we thought was okay was their dessert, but to top that off they had the best rhubarb caramel (which we would love to purchase, except they said that wasn't possible ughhh).

If I wasn't already vegan, this dining experience would have surely turned me. Also, next level gourmet tater tots; tapioca mushroom dumpling were insane; fried chickpea tofu... so fantastic. We got the tasting menu which was incredible at only $85 CAD and little morsels of a bunch of different dishes so you get to try a lot of variety but plenty of food left us satisfied and full by the time dessert came.

We were pleasantly surprised to find that there is no tipping required. Either that or we missed it, in which case, soooo sorry.\n\nThe taste of the appetizers were light and delicate. Fits my impression of what vegan dishes ought to be like. The curry zucchini had a stronger flavor but even that felt rather light.\n\nMy favorite dish was the chickpea tofu. I just like chickpeas and I like tofu. What can I say. My least favorite was the heirloom tomatoes but it wasn't because it didn't taste good, it just wasn't very memorable.\n\nIf you're a vegan or want to try to clean the bilges so to speak this is definitely worth a try. We paired it with a bottle of the Kutatas Viz (recommended by the server because they were out of the rose we wanted). It paired well with all the dishes but I'd try the reisling next time, and there will be a next time.",

My my my, they still serve  small portions - must be pigmy chickens!! LOL, but the smoothness and flavour makes up for the lack of quantity.

And I just came here for brunch, so I should write about my eating experience here.\n\nAll the food and presentation looked great! If you see photos of the bento boxes here, I would be drooling and looking forward to eating the food again. Each item was cooked and presented well. No doubt about it. One thing that I would like the restaurant to be improved on was the temperature of the food. I believe most of the food was cooked ahead of time, so when we placed an order, the chef or staff at the kitchen would put them nicely in a bento box, so everything looked great but the food was not hot at all. The rice, miso soup, and everything else were at room temperature. It will be greatly appreciated if the food is cooked and hot right out of the stove or oven.\n\nThe restaurant is on the rooftop of a low rise building. My family and I walked stairs and it's quite a lot of stairs to get to the restaurant. If someone who can't walk on stairs or who is on a wheelchair, you might have to look around and see if they have an elevator to go up to the top floor.\n\nIt is a great place to meet with friends or family and enjoy a special meal here. There is a parkade next to the building or people take public transit and walk to the restaurant.",

There must be something wrong happening and we apologize that we served lukewarm food to you. We will find and fix the error to serve you better on your next visit. \n\nWe have elevators next to the building, the same as the parkade. You might need to ask the concierge to get up to the restaurant since it is a little hard to find the way to reach the restaurant.\n\nThank you very much for the heads-up for our food quality and we look forward to serving you soon.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nYasuaki",

They have a sign on ground floor says it's opened, however, there's no sign on second floor, so we kind of feel lost and don't know where it is.\n\nOnce we went up to third floor, we found the restaurant and everything is so amazing! They have a really Japanese style interior decoration which is cute and aesthetic.\n\nWe ordered 3 combos and every food is tasty! Really recommend the royal bento, it's $30 but you got to try so many dishes!\n\nWill definitely recommend to others and come back!",

So it all started with when i went there to have my dinner at this place and we didn't had any food since morning. We ordered in clear words a paneer masala roll and veg steamed momos. The order taker heard us wrong and she punched a chicken masala roll. My friend is a non-vegetarian person but it all comes to me i am a vegetarian person by birth and it's like i don't even eat eggs. We were so hungry that we started eating the wrap and also as i said above we didn't ate since morning so we didn't realised initially that we were served chicken but later my friend realised since he is a non-vegetarian person. As I complained to the order taker, she was like i always double confirm the order. But we clearly remember that we ordered a paneer masala roll and she didn't double confirmed with us as well. It was all her mistake and she knows that very well. And also in their apologies, when i asked sincerely can i know the name of order taker by any chance. She replied \"IT WILL AFFECT MY JOB\". Seriously, are you kidding me? It has affected my life. Just one mistake of order taker who was varsha has affected me mentally, can anybody imagine that she made a vegetarian person eat chicken. It comes under my religion and i am a pure vegetarian. It's high time to consider this review. That being said, at the time of ordering, we clearly also told her to cut the wrap in two halves. She was like yes, i'll do it for you. Later when i went to pick my food, i asked her, that is it in two halves already? She told me yes. When I opened the wrap it was in one full piece. I need to ask her again to cut in two. That clearly shows she didn't heard us right while taking the order. Such discrepancies while taking order shouldn't be considered that too to a pure vegetarian person, who never ate since born.",

The flavors are truly distinctive, preserving that unmistakable Persian essence. While the ambiance is relatively cozy, it's a pleasant deviation from the online photos, which adds to its charm.\n\nTheir drink menu impressed me with its variety and creative names. I especially enjoyed the Persian Godfather cocktail. For appetizers, we indulged in the succulent Kofteh and the delightful Grilled Sourdough Flatbread with Seasonal Dips, both of which were exquisite.\n\nMoving on to the main course, we tried the Smoked Rice and Lentil Bowl, which, unfortunately, came out a bit too dry for my taste. However, the Roasted Chicken Leg with Barberries and Tahdig more than made up for it. The crispy chicken paired perfectly with the sides of Yoghourt and Torshi (pickles). The adorable and delicious bread was a nice touch too.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered Persian Chai, Baklava, and Safran ice cream. While the overall dessert experience was pleasant, there was a slight hiccup with the ice cream order. Our server initially brought the wrong order and seemed a bit displeased when we pointed it out. Despite being her second day on the job, I believe a courteous response to a mistake is important. Nevertheless, the correction was made, but the Safran ice cream was not what we expected. Kind of disappointing.\n\nOverall, this restaurant offers a delightful blend of fusion and authentic Persian cuisine, with a few service  improvements needed. I would certainly recommend it for the unique culinary journey it provides",

The restaurant space is medium size open floor with benches and tables on one side and a bar on the other. The kitchen is at the far end of the floor and visible from where you sit, so you can smell the food as it's being cooked.\nWe tried Grilled Beef Ghalieh, Koofteh 18, and Chicken and Barberries and loved all three dishes. Grilled beef Ghalieh was like a stew with a savory sauce and a piece of tender beef short rib. The chicken was so tender. The koofteh tasted like classic nostalgic Iranian koofteh you'd get at your grandma's.\nWe were told if you'd like to sit at the benches, you can leave a note when you're reserving your table if you have a preferred spot. We noted in our reservation our birthday occasion and they were nice to bring us a small cute baklava and a candle in the end. The place obviously has its own theme and is not like any other typical Persian restaurant. So if you're looking to get quantity food or kabob, this is not the right choice. But of you like to taste true Persian cuisine and experience Persian food with a contemporary style, this is absolutely the place. You can tell the owner cares about the cuisine the most.\nI read in the reviews that if you have a birthday cake, you can't eat it in the restaurant and it's mentioned in the website. So if you're planning a birthday and have a cake, you better review their policy or check in with them in advance.\nOverall we had a wonderful experience and we'd like to come back when the menu changes so we can try their different dishes.",

Had you informed us in a nicer tone and attitude we really wouldn't have minded. We have also brought cakes to many many other restaurants and never had any issues in the last 30 years - but Delara proved us wrong. We don't mind paying the extra service fee or tipping extra, but the waiter sounded like our presence was a disturbance.

It was very hard to catch any staff's attention for stuff from getting water to getting the bill.\n\nMaybe the food was just not our taste, but we found everything to be very salty. The portion sizes were also unsatisfying for what we were paying. The food in general was just very underwhelming. As we scratch our heads to think about a single positive experience, we absolutely can't think of any and that's truly a shame.",

The atmosphere is suited as being down to Earth and fairly laid back with a hint of formality, which is always nice. The food is good, but not great, considering the cost. The fish seemed relatively fresh, which was great. Presentation was good. However, for hot dishes, we received warm food that seemed like it was left out a while before getting to our table. I think this aspect could be improved upon. I would go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to wait in line to eat here.",

If you celebrate your anniversary or birthday, they will offer a complimentary pudding and sing a special song for you. It will be my number one if I want to enjoy the Japanese food. Definitely will let all my friends know and highly recommend if you want to try. Just in case, please remember to make your reservation.",

You get rice under the pickled veggies and salad, the chicken and prawns were juicy and warm still and give a nice middle eastern taste. In the whole bowl you pretty much get a little bit of everything, sweet from the pomegranates, savoury from the chicken, spicy from the jalapenos, tangy from the pickled veggies and a good balance of rice and that great wet sauce on top!

This culinary gem, which we wholeheartedly recommend to all fellow food enthusiasts, is none other than the restaurant where we indulged in the freshest, healthiest, and most delectable dishes we've ever had the pleasure of savoring.\nThe restaurant's ambiance was cozy and welcoming, creating the perfect atmosphere for a memorable dining experience. However, what truly sets this place apart is its commitment to serving healthy yet incredibly delicious food. We were pleasantly surprised to discover an extensive menu filled with a variety of options to cater to various dietary preferences. As health-conscious individuals, we couldn't have been more delighted.\nOne of the standout dishes we had the pleasure of trying was the \"Grizzly's Catch.\" This seafood masterpiece was a true culinary delight. The perfectly seared fish was tender, flaky, and bursting with flavor. The accompanying fresh vegetables and light drizzle of sauce complemented the dish perfectly, making it a must-try for any seafood lover.\nAnother absolute winner was the \"Yogi's Paradise.\" This vegetarian dish was a symphony of flavors and textures. The combination of perfectly grilled tofu, sauteed vegetables, and a mouthwatering sauce made this dish an explosion of taste in every bite. It was a pleasant surprise even for us, non-vegetarians, and it showcased the restaurant's mastery in creating dishes that cater to all palates.\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of our dining experience was the exceptional service provided by Chef Ankit. His passion for food was palpable, and he went above and beyond to ensure that we were not only well-fed but also educated about each dish's preparation. His detailed explanations and friendly demeanor added a personal touch to our meal, making it all the more special.\nIn addition to the incredible food and service, we were also impressed by the restaurant's commitment to using fresh, locally sourced ingredients. It was evident that quality and health were top priorities in every dish they prepared.\nOur journey in Canada would not have been complete without this culinary adventure, and for that, we are deeply grateful to Chef Ankit and the entire restaurant team. We wholeheartedly recommend this establishment to anyone visiting the area. Whether you're a health-conscious diner or simply in search of a fantastic meal, this restaurant is a must-visit.

It was well marinated and very fragrant !\n\nWe also got the Krsma Chicken Tikka (15.95) which was super juicy , tender and had a slight sourness from the yogurt.\n\nLastly we got an order of fish pakoras (9.95). These were lightly battered and very juicy. The batter was crispy and lightly salted. Amazing with the mint chutney!\n\nThe staff were generous and gave us complimentary papadum! It was very crispy and lightly salted. It came with tamarind and mint chutney. The mint chutney was stellar ! It was the perfect blend of sour, spicy any lemon!\n\nEdit (10/21/23): went back for lunch and tried their Onion Bajia 8.95 and fish korma 15.95 with a side of rice (4.95). The onion Bajia was very crispy and lightly battered, with the perfect amount of saltiness and crispiness. The fish korma was outstanding! The cashew curry was very rich and had a yummy sweetness to it. The fish was also very tender.\n\nThe owner was kind and provided a Gulab Jamun on the house, it was nice and warm...mmmm.",

I am a big fan of their vermicelli bowls, and the fried spring rolls are amazing. I love that they do the crispy thick wrapper, whereas many restaurants do thinner wrap.\n\nI ordered a grilled chicken with spring roll vermicelli bowl for take out, however there was some miscommunication as when I got home I realized they gave me pork. Regardless, it was so good that I ended up dining in the next day. This time I successfuly got the grilled chicken and it was also delicious. I've tried their pho in the past and it is a good standard bowl of pho.\n\nThe restaurant is clean, feels new, and our server was attentive and nice. Will be ordering from here whenever I crave Vietnamese!",

Providing a detailed video of each dish; photos of the menu for you to enjoy and the SAKE/Atmosphere. Giving the atmosphere a 5/5 because of the music. Don't miss out on this friends =).

Walking into International Village Mall for the first time, you might be taken aback by how empty and dead it feels, especially in contrast to the surrounding lively Gastown district. But you'd be surprised by how alive the food scene is. Especially this little hidden gem.\n\nWe had:\n\nPad Thai Combo ($14.99 + $2 for choosing prawns) - one of the best I've had, the flavour was a perfect balance of slightly sweet, savoury and a little kick of spice (you can adjust). The combo comes with the following: (1) a salad, (2) a spring roll, (3) a soup, and (4) your choice of a drink. The soup was clean and clear but packed with flavour. It was a clear sign that the chef is talented\n\nTom Kah Goong (Prawn) ($14.95) - this is very reminiscent of the more popular Tom Yum soup but with the addition of creamy coconut milk. It was piping hot (seriously, be careful!) but I fought through the pain to gulp it down because it was so delicious! Those hot, sour, creamy flavours all melded together into an amazing concoction. Bites of mushroom, lemongrass, tomatoes, onions, and prawns throughout were delightful\n\nThe fact that you're getting this level of restaurant-quality (and honestly much better than some restaurants) food in a little place like this is unbelievable. They're the sweetest and they obviously pour so much love into what they do. If you're ever in the area, I hope you'll consider stopping by this hidden food court! While its exterior may not seem particularly extraordinary, it holds some amazing flavours and wonderful people.",

But you'd be surprised by how alive the food scene is. Especially this little hidden gem.\n\nWe had:\n\nPad Thai Combo ($14.99 + $2 for choosing prawns) - one of the best I've had, the flavour was a perfect balance of slightly sweet, savoury and a little kick of spice (you can adjust). The combo comes with the following: (1) a salad, (2) a spring roll, (3) a soup, and (4) your choice of a drink. The soup was clean and clear but packed with flavour. It was a clear sign that the chef is talented\n\nTom Kah Goong (Prawn) ($14.95) - this is very reminiscent of the more popular Tom Yum soup but with the addition of creamy coconut milk. It was piping hot (seriously, be careful!) but I fought through the pain to gulp it down because it was so delicious! Those hot, sour, creamy flavours all melded together into an amazing concoction. Bites of mushroom, lemongrass, tomatoes, onions, and prawns throughout were delightful\n\nThe fact that you're getting this level of restaurant-quality (and honestly much better than some restaurants) food in a little place like this is unbelievable. They're the sweetest and they obviously pour so much love into what they do. If you're ever in the area, I hope you'll consider stopping by this hidden food court! While its exterior may not seem particularly extraordinary, it holds some amazing flavours and wonderful people.",

We now have two kinds of chicken wing dishes,one is our michi stuffed wings and the other one is our new item\"grilled whole wings\". Your were ordering the \" grilled wings\", but  unfortunately our grilled wings are sold out today, and we had mention to you that our regular michi is still available today. However you didn't order the regular michi. And the table after you saw was also the regular michi, not the grilled wings.  We will definitely take your feedback into consideration as we continue to work hard to improve. It would be great if we could chat over email - michiyvr@gmail.com , I look forward to hearing from you!!   ",

What was unexpected was that the dishes we weren't considering a la carte turned out to be total hits. The raddiccio, cheddar, apple and ham salad was incredible - light, with a sweet and savory balance. The lingcod had the most ethereal vadouvan spiced sauce and flavourful fingerling potatoes. And the sauce gribiche for the cured steelhead was a standout.\n\nThe final savoury course - the pork cheeks with spaetzle, plentiful chanterelles and sourdough breadcrumb - was perfection.\n\nLoved everything about the place, and unbeatable value with today's prices. Highly recommend.",

Where to start? they have done everything remarkably on their FIRST opening day.\n\nAmbience : We love, love the decorations and the ambience, combining simple white and black color. The space is small but feels very warm and comforting\n\nFoods : We got the 64$ menu per person for two people which allow us to get 2 snacks, two appetizers, two main course and a dessert. The foods are actually above our expectations. We know we will get good foods, but we expect to eat at duffins or panago after because we thought we will be still hungry due to the portion in reality, the foods portion is PERFECT for two people.\n\nFlavour wise, combining fresh ingredients from local farms and fisheries, we feel that every food has been given much thought, care and love. Everything is fresh, from the lettuce to the lingcod. Our favourite of the night was the pork cheek. WE DON'T HAVE TO CHEW IT!! it was so tender and so much flavours.\n\nService : top notch service. Jes served us yesterday and she was so informative, polite and very thoughtful, explaining the menu and cater to my girlfriend's spice intolerance very very seriously. She feels like a friend, not a server! Also, I drink lots and lots of water, so i appreciate tht they put a bottle of water on our table!\n\nOverall 5/5. We will come back and TELL our friends to come here because we believe Gary's is a great place to be and a place for people to feel comfortable, full and feel welcomed everytime.\n\nGOOD JOB!",

                    "review_text": "Wow! that is the first word that me and my girlfriend said after finishing our dinner date at Gary's. Where to start? they have done everything remarkably on their FIRST opening day.\n\nAmbience : We love, love the decorations and the ambience, combining simple white and black color. The space is small but feels very warm and comforting\n\nFoods : We got the 64$ menu per person for two people which allow us to get 2 snacks, two appetizers, two main course and a dessert. The foods are actually above our expectations. We know we will get good foods, but we expect to eat at duffins or panago after because we thought we will be still hungry due to the portion in reality, the foods portion is PERFECT for two people.\n\nFlavour wise, combining fresh ingredients from local farms and fisheries, we feel that every food has been given much thought, care and love. Everything is fresh, from the lettuce to the lingcod. Our favourite of the night was the pork cheek. WE DON'T HAVE TO CHEW IT!! it was so tender and so much flavours.\n\nService : top notch service. Jes served us yesterday and she was so informative, polite and very thoughtful, explaining the menu and cater to my girlfriend's spice intolerance very very seriously. She feels like a friend, not a server! Also, I drink lots and lots of water, so i appreciate tht they put a bottle of water on our table!\n\nOverall 5/5. We will come back and TELL our friends to come here because we believe Gary's is a great place to be and a place for people to feel comfortable, full and feel welcomed everytime.\n\nGOOD JOB!",

I saw them going into the cafe and many of the employees of the supply store they are located at. Had no idea it was at a lumber and hardware supply warehouse, surrounded by many other commercial warehouses, such a great surprise, which just makes it that much better. Absolutely loved the atmosphere and the owners. Very friendly older couple and their son run this awesome famiky owned cafe.\n\nAwesome home cooked breakfast, amazing friendly and relaxed service, and unbelievable atmosphere. When I got there, I was the only one, but I still loved it so much. The old school diner style furniture and music were awesome. I got the pancake with blueberries, sunny side up eggs, and sausage, which were all very good. Loved their old small glass coffee maker and the mugs. The son who was serving was very nice and friendly....he me told me that this place has been around since the 1940s and his parents got this place 15 years ago have been in the business for so long after they retired, wanted to have a slow and small place and now this place is exploded and is crazy busy ...which I find very funny and awesome.\n\nWill definitely come back to try their burgers and Chinese food.",

Inside is something you won't find anywhere else in Vancouver!\n\nThe atmosphere at Northern Cafe is inviting, reflecting its family-run ethos. The menu offers a variety of comfort food options, and we opted for burgers and a side of poutine. The food was exceptional--each bite of the burger was a blend of flavors and textures, and the poutine was a delightful mix of crispy fries, cheese, and well-balanced gravy.\n\nWhat stood out, even more, was the service. The staff were attentive and courteous, enhancing the overall dining experience. It's evident why this establishment has garnered such high praise and even topped lists of the best places to eat in Canada.\n\nA particularly charming touch was the inclusion of watermelon slices with our meal. It added a refreshing contrast to the hearty fare and demonstrated the restaurant's attention to detail. Another delightful aspect was the handwritten reviews by children displayed on the wall, which actually helped us make our menu choices.\n\nNorthern Cafe lives up to its reputation. The combination of delicious food, excellent service, and a welcoming atmosphere makes it a must-visit. Making a reservation is highly recommended!",

Will definitely not return.\n\nCarrot halwa was stale, I had to spit it out. I complained and they did replace it but it was too late anyway.

It was around 10pm and they rushed us to order food and drinks.\nOnly good thing was our server. Guy worked really hard and he was the only one on the floor. We ordered rose lassi and margrita. Drinks were great but obviously it took some time to arrive on our table since there was only one guy to do all the tasks. Five stars only for him and i dont want to affect your restaurant ratings. I didnt get a chance to catch his name but if you are reading this.. you are doing a great job. U saved 4 stars for your restaurant otherwise i would have given only one star for food.",

You can have a coffee and get a bird's-eye view of the store, or watch out the window at the traffic on Cambie Street.

They do a lot of recycling in the coffee shop and the Market.  WiFi is good.  Bathroom is good.  The only problem is that (at the moment) the coffee shop closes at 2PM.  But there is cafe seating in the Market below.  Which is nice.  I only like to review places I like and this definitely one of them.  It's got a good vibe.

I highly recommend stopping by during their happy hour to savor these fantastic oysters.",

Not much of a view but the cool vibe, smooth fixtures and furniture and chilled sound track more than made up for this. Our drink quickly turned into a meal and several drinks. The food was excellent and not as pricey as the surroundings would lead you to believe. The waiting staff were as alert and attentive than any that I have encountered. A lush experience.

For cocktails we got the sangria and Prosecco.\n\nThe Wagyu beef carpaccio was lacking in beef flavour. It was cut a little too thin for me to pick up (just a snag). The tuna tartare was not bad. Very fresh tasting and I liked the addition of the pineapple. The chip went perfectly with the tuna tartare. The oysters were pretty standard. The sangria was delicious as usual.\n\nOverall for happy hour they have a pretty big menu compared to other restaurants. They have a wide variety and the portions are pretty big. The service was super friendly and helpful when it comes to making decisions on the menu. This is the place to be if you are looking for a snack and drinks with friends and a nice location but not for food",

Any time that I have, the cook has greeted us with a sample and has been very kind.\n\nAs for the food itself, it's delicious. The best carnitas I have had yet. Generous portions and at a good price too.",

What followed was nothing short of a culinary masterpiece.\n\nThe lunch box was a trove of tantalizing flavors. The tacos were generously filled with their signature carnitas - a loving testament to the art of slow-cooked, melt-in-your-mouth pork. The carnitas were impeccably seasoned, their inherent richness perfectly balanced by the tangy green salsa and a lively pico de gallo.\n\nWhat surprised me was the thoughtful inclusion of jalapenos and limes in the package. The jalapenos added a delightful kick of heat when desired, while the limes were perfect for squeezing over the tacos, lending a refreshing acidity that cut through the richness of the carnitas. Wrapped in soft, pliable corn tortillas, every bite was an exciting play of textures and flavors that kept my taste buds eagerly awaiting the next mouthful.\n\nEqually impressive were the sides. The Habanero Salsa delivered a more robust heat for those who crave a bit more spice, while the Guacamole provided a creamy, cooling contrast, a perfect companion to the star of the box - the carnitas.\n\nBut what truly sets Carnitas Don Jose apart from the rest isn't just the quality of their food - it's the evident passion and care that goes into crafting each meal. This isn't fast food; this is a love letter to traditional Mexican cooking, delivered conveniently in a takeout box.\n\nCarnitas Don Jose is not just a pit-stop for food - it's a destination for anyone who appreciates good, hearty meals that stay with you long after the last bite. My advice? Don't just pass by this gem. Stop, order, and prepare to be pleasantly surprised. After all, great food isn't just about satisfying hunger, it's about the experience. And Carnitas Don Jose offers an experience you won't forget.",

Their Toro tastes buttery, and their octopus is actually soft. Unlike some octopus from other sushi restaurants that taste like chewy rubber. They proudly showcase the fresh, raw taste and texture of each ingredient with delicate seasonings. Service is great, and you get your food served fast. If there's a reason why they only open for 3 hours a day, it would probably be that they want to offer a high quality of restaurant experience. Definitely recommend.",

Which is why as a younger person, I need to advocate for the elderly. Our table was the youngest one, the rest are elderly people. Understand that geriatric patients often lose their sense of smell and taste and come with other health problems, HBP, diabetes, etc. As a community, we should be supporting everyone: local business and our community members. Two items are bad items: sui mai (meat stinks and is old, when you bring it near  to consumer it already had foul smell, the chiu chow dumpling was terribly made on a physical level but this is also the 2nd item that is foul (it was at a distance from me and I can already smell it from the table).\n\nMenu: needs to be updated to reflect their items. One error to note is squid tentacles in English but when served, its not tentacles and turns out the Chinese name is just squid. Fried quid tentacles is a rarity so if I see tentacles in English, I will order it. But it is not. You need to update the menu because that is flat out deceiving.\n\nStaff: The good, they have full staff. The bad, inefficient. I assume there is 1-2 front staff that is either the owner or affiliated with the small business because they CARE. They either huddle around and follow each other walking up and down (with the second person behind not doing anything and not looking around). There are quite a few staff that have dyed red hair. The long red hair literally yelled at me to give me the receipt so she can cross it off (this is when she served me \"squid tentacles\" and it was not tentacles, at that point, I asked my family if I red it wrong because clearly I remember seeing the word tentacles and thought perhaps they are giving us the wrong order. The other 2 red hair ladies have short hair, one with a similar haircut from TVB Moonlight Resonance main villain (ah Hung) tends to do cleanup and will ignore any hand waiving at all times. Regardless, poor service from the short red hair staff.\n\nFor the two ladies that have long hair and straight black hair, they were efficient but may also be affiliated with the small business.\n\nTea: after one round, tea flavor is gone. It took the 3rd person to finally give us new tea leaves.\n\nPayment: tea was waived, I assume its new opening so they are waiving. When asked to pay, they said if I can pay cash because tea is waived. I said no, the staff did not look happy. In a business perspective, some businesses understand that cashless payment versus cash is inevitable and understands the charges for the fees. This comes with the territory of opening a business. Either that, go cash only and understand you will be working with specific niche if that's the way you want to go.\n\nUses Clover POS system but doesn't take Apple watch payment (tried several times but it says try again). Physical card tap works, had to take out my debit card for transaction to go through.\n\nRice roll never came, I asked them to take it off the menu. But she said she'll followup; however, I had to tell her firmly to take it off (this was right after the the 2nd item came and was foul). She respectfully said to take it off the menu and also came back with the rice rolls but I was firm and said I don't want it anymore. After I paid, I then told her about the foul food items to which they said, why didn't you tell us? Typical Chinese way will always be \"I'll give you a new one\" which is what I'm not interested. I was then given a to-go box of pastries free of charge (again turned it down). I have dignity and pride giving honest food reviews and I come from moral values. And I'm also not those terrible customers that take advantage of businesses either for getting free food (to that I say they are scammers).",

                    "review_text": "My review with comes good intentions because I understand the struggles that small businesses face and I come with feedback and how to move forward with my experience.\n\nClientele and food: Geriatric consumers. Which is why as a younger person, I need to advocate for the elderly. Our table was the youngest one, the rest are elderly people. Understand that geriatric patients often lose their sense of smell and taste and come with other health problems, HBP, diabetes, etc. As a community, we should be supporting everyone: local business and our community members. Two items are bad items: sui mai (meat stinks and is old, when you bring it near  to consumer it already had foul smell, the chiu chow dumpling was terribly made on a physical level but this is also the 2nd item that is foul (it was at a distance from me and I can already smell it from the table).\n\nMenu: needs to be updated to reflect their items. One error to note is squid tentacles in English but when served, its not tentacles and turns out the Chinese name is just squid. Fried quid tentacles is a rarity so if I see tentacles in English, I will order it. But it is not. You need to update the menu because that is flat out deceiving.\n\nStaff: The good, they have full staff. The bad, inefficient. I assume there is 1-2 front staff that is either the owner or affiliated with the small business because they CARE. They either huddle around and follow each other walking up and down (with the second person behind not doing anything and not looking around). There are quite a few staff that have dyed red hair.

I ordered only their recommended dishes - pork toast, stir-fry basil, and boat noodles. The pork toast was very disappointing. There was barely any pork on the toast, like 95% bread and 5% pork. It just tasted like oily bread. Boat noodles were awful. Noodles were congealed. I couldn't even separate it in the hot soup. I am questioning the freshness of their noodles. Was it cooked a head of time hours ago? Soup was bland. Salt and lots of oil. Meat pieces were tough and chewy. The stir fry basil dish was solid and was the best out of the 3 dishes I ordered. Overall, there are better Thai restaurants that are way more affordable.",

They were much busier on this visit (guess the word had gotten out). Loved the translucent noodles in the drunken noodle dish and the green curry rice was amazing. The tom yum soup was spicy and chock full of ingredients. And we enjoyed the items in the platter (crispy pork toast, veggie spring rolls, shrimp wrap, and pork jerky).",

From the moment we stepped in, the ambiance set the stage for what was an unforgettable evening. The decor, an elegant blend of traditional Thai elements and modern touches, created a welcoming and lively atmosphere.\n\nThe service was exceptional. Our server was knowledgeable, attentive, and had great suggestions for our diverse group. We started with Assorted Appetizers, Veggie spring rolls, crispy pork toast, shrimp wrap, and pork jerky. Each dish was a hit, perfectly balanced in flavors and textures.\n\nThe main courses were a delightful journey through Thai cuisine. The green curry with chicken was rich and aromatic, with just the right level of spice. The Pad Thai was simply the best I've ever had, with a perfect blend of sweet, sour, and great flavors. We also tried a lesser-known dish, Khao Soi, which was a revelation with its creamy coconut curry and tender noodles.\n\nWhat truly made the night special was the shared joy of exploring these flavors with friends. The portions were generous, ideal for sharing, and it sparked lively conversations and shared laughter. To end the meal, we indulged in mango sticky rice and Thai iced tea, which were the perfect sweet notes to conclude a fantastic meal.\n\nIn summary, Zab Bite restaurant is not just about extraordinary Thai food; it's about the experience of sharing delicious, well-crafted dishes with good company in a beautiful setting. It's a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy Thai cuisine at its best. A solid 5 stars for the amazing food, ambiance, and service. Can't wait to return!",

We also get charged 30% for every order that comes through ubereats, we are sure you are not aware of that and we have to factor that into our prices.\n\nAs regards to the promo on the app but we don't control the Ubereats app, we are just a platform there- you might want to pass that feedback to them.\n\nWe can see from the image you posted that you ordered BBQ Chicken and we can see thats what you got, we do not understand what the problem is? Giving a business 1 star review when we clearly didnt do anything wrong is not fair!\n\nFeel free to share your feedback with uber, but as a company we are very transparent and pride ourselves in delivering great services to our customers.",

I did receive a call but the caller ID automatically said \"suspected spam\" so I didn't answer. They were nice to write me a note with my order to let me know some things were changed. I did get to try both chicken and beef tough. The chicken was soft but the beef to me was a lot tougher. I prefer the chicken so I will try the chicken only again next time. I am a very big fan of sauce and if you like it too, this is a great place for you. The wrap is smothered in sauce and filled with meet and cabbage. If you cannot tolerate spice, the mild would still have a little spice as well. The large version was bigger than a shawarma wrap at other places. However, I found the original price very expensive as it was around $18 for a large wrap. The UberEats BOGO was a very good deal though.",

It is a tasty meatball made with pork and bamboo shoots and other good flavoured stuff wrapped in a chewy, bouncy, starchy coating similar to a mochi texture. It's almost like a giant dumpling and it is delicious.\n\nThe beef noodle soups with thick noodle were just average because there was a thick layer of oil on the soup that was too greasy (if they could just skim off the oil it would be much better in my opinion so you can get to the tasty broth without so much oil). The noodles were also overdone to the point they would snap when you picked it up and they were mushy to eat. The noodles were so soft you couldn't even chew them.\n\nThe deep fried pork intestines were very tasty but the portion was quite small for what you pay. The milk teas were average. The Taiwanese deep fried chicken nuggets tasted authentic.",

A few days ago, I heard from a friend that this restaurant was opening in Vancouver, and we were filled with excitement. On the day of their official opening, to avoid the crowded crowd, we arrived at five o'clock. The restaurant's decor is simple, but the advertising slogans and pictures on the walls are quite interesting. We ordered some Taiwanese snacks that we had been longing for, including TW Meatball W Pork Bamboo Shoot, Deep Fried Boneless Chicken Thigh Rice, Spicy Pork Ear Slice, and MARINATED BAMBOO SHOOTS. All the dishes still retained the authentic Taiwanese style and flavor. We all enjoyed our meal. When it was time to pay, because they were newly opened, they were selling a Super Value Coupon Book, buy 50 get 50. Each five-dollar voucher came with a note: \"$5 Vouchers can only be used per person per transaction.\" I even asked the staff at that time how to use them. However, to our surprise, when we went to eat there again yesterday, the staff insisted from start to finish that the three of us could only use two five-dollar vouchers. This statement completely contradicted the clear and straightforward rule: \"$5 Vouchers can only be used per person per transaction.\" When we asked the staff for an explanation, she said, \"We have always done it this way.\" \"Always\"? You just opened recently. We feel this is a deceptive practice and are very disappointed. We hope this company can provide a reasonable explanation.\n\nNote: Thank you, owner , for such a quick response and for resolving our concerns so clearly. I believe excellent quality and honest treatment of customers are important driving forces for a prosperous business.",
