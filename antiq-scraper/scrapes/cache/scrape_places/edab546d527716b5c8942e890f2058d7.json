I didnt understand what she told me was and i asked same question twice and suddenly both of staff(female pharmacist and pick up area staff) they were laughing in front of me which is ridiculous and very rude. This pharmacy needs to re-train your staff there, all the staff there was super rude and they need to learn how to greet customer and also need to learn how to smile at customer.

Annoying but not awful. My biggest challenge is refills. The phone number currently printed on the bottles is incorrect. The phone number listed on Google is also wrong. Even the automated system you get when you call Superstore sends you to the wrong number. I had to get someone at the customer service desk to tell me the number, hang up, and redial it directly. I picked this pharmacy because I recently moved nearby and I usually get my groceries at Superstore, so this seemed like an easy decision. How could it be less convenient than driving 25 minutes across town to my old pharmacy near my old apartment? Superstore accepted my challenge and exceeded my expectations.",

The judgemental arrogant attitude I received, coupled with the fact he told me I couldn't get my inhaler filled until the next day (it was only 4pm) even tho I told him I was short of breath and it's just ventolin that I ALREADY HAVE A REFILL ON FILE FOR, leads me to give them a 1/10.

They pretty much take their time as they please to attend their customers. When one calls them, they take so long to pick up the call, if even they pick up the call. There has been several times I contacted them on the phone and they did not even pick up the call. To me seems like that they don't even want to be there. If I could give them 0 stars I would.

Unfortunately, it was marred by the behavior of the male pharmacist on duty, who was not only rude but also condescending. This kind of treatment is unacceptable, especially in a place that is supposed to provide care and support to customers.\n\nMy Mum, who is already dealing with health issues, should not have had to endure such disrespectful behavior from a professional who is meant to be compassionate and understanding. It left her feeling uncomfortable and hesitant to return to the pharmacy in the future.\n\nPharmacies should be safe spaces where people can trust the advice and assistance of the professionals working there. However, this experience at Loblaw Pharmacy shattered that sense of security and reliability. It is disheartening to see that a place that is supposed to cater to the health needs of the community fails to meet even the basic standards of customer service and respect.\n\nI hope that this review serves as a wakeup call for Loblaw Pharmacy management to address the issue promptly. It is crucial for them to reevaluate their staff's behavior and ensure that such incidents do not happen again. No customer, especially someone seeking medical help, should be made to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.\n\nGiven the negative experience my Mum had, I cannot recommend Loblaw Pharmacy to anyone until they address and rectify the situation. It is essential for any business to prioritize customer care, and in this regard, Loblaw Pharmacy has fallen short. As a result, I strongly advise seeking an alternative pharmacy where you can feel confident that you will be treated with respect and kindness during your visits.",

A few times I've refilled my prescription ahead of time only to arrive and find it's not ready or the medication is not available, yet no one bothered to contact me. One time I was told to return in 45 min which I did after waking around the store to be told my medication wasn't in stock yet no one bothered to call me.

I called my doctor and explained the situation, he said that I absolutely shouldn't experiment and see if I get sick or not. He called the pharmacy and changed the prescription.  I had to wait another hour for the new prescription to be ready (of course they didn't take back the first one), but the best part was when my wife told them that their service is poor she got the answer, \"then don't come here\".

Started by saying that they tried billing it and they were unable to get the coverage ( checked with my carrier and superstore never even attempted) and the last time I tried superstore told my that my coverage was denied and I was no longer covered by the provider. So I instantly went into stress mode, turns out that was a lie. I know manually entering in your prescription details and getting the refund a week or two later isn't the biggest problem but it is still very annoying being lied to and told a number of different reasons why they do not do direct billing.

I didn't have the time to wait so continued on my shopping journey.  As I was leaving the store, Lay asked if I needed to renew a 'scrip' I said yes, he asked how many meds I needed, I said all 4 and off he want to prepare my monthly order.  Didn't ask my name, no hassle, he just knew what needed to be done.  When I picked up my order today (post December 31st, he understood that I needed the scrip renewal in the last fiscal year, which was reflected.\n\nIn my opinion Lay goes the extra mile, knows his customers, their needs and is always respectful, always helpful , and always responsive.  Employee of the Year Award, if there is one, is 'owned' by Lay.  Many thanks for all of your hard work, dedication, for being there when lots of people haven't been.\n\nAll the very best to you Lay and your family.
