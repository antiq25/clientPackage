So the lady on the call confirmed to write email to the boutique to call me and its been two days no one reached out to me still. So pathetic quality product and above the pathetic customer service. The audacity of this brand I tell you. I recommend Gucci brand to please learn some quality and customer service from \"Coach\" I bought few bags from them and they have amazing customer service and quality. They even remember my name everytime I walkin and makes me feel welcome and above everything quality of product is just amazing. I will go to the boutique and take my bag and never ever buy gucci again.",

I went to the store seeking for help but the manger named Lee is not providing me a satisfying solution and he makes me feel so bad. Here is the situation.\nI bought a BLACK Sylvie leather bag in 2017. I use it no more than half a year.Then I find out the BLACK leather turned RED. First, I thought I dyed the bag red accidentally so I just put it away and never use it again. Until recently, I find out it is a common leather problem for the 2017 black Sylvie bag so I went to the store hoping Gucci can repair it for me since it was a faulty product. The first time I went there, the two sales told me Gucci would probably fixed it or exchange me a new one as it is quite obvious the bag was faulty and it is in great condition which means it is not due to 'old age'.\nTwo months later, they told me I need to pay for repairing the leather since the bag has expired the 2-year warranty. This is my first time to be informed that I have expiry dates for my Gucci bags!!!\nI went to the store again talking to Lee who I believe is the manager of the store. He is not sympathetic or understanding at all. He noticed it was a faulty product and I told him I never know your 2-year warranty policy. (I believe most of the customers didn't notice this policy.)\nWhatever I say, he just quickly replies...Sorry...your bag has exceeded our 2-year warranty...Sorry...your bag has exceeded our 2-year warranty...Sorry....your bag has exceeded our 2-year warranty.......At last, he said the store can only pay half of the repairing fee or we can give back your bag to you......I said I want my bag back and he just disappeared without saying anything!!!!!!! Later another sales associate help get my bag to me.\nThis store manger makes me feel so bbbbaaaaaadd.... he acts like I don't give a sh** to your 'expired' bag.....I am now so frustrated and regret buying this bag!!!!!!!",
