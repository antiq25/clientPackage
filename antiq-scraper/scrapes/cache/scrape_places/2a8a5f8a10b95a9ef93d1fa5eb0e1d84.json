The team was quick to respond, flexible with my needs, and overall enjoyable to work with. Looking forward to partnering with Prettech again in the future as we scale up our business.",

Then another week.  Then Otis said they would come on Monday, and simply didn't show up for a week.  They evidently don't work on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays.\n\nhere are elderly people in the building who are missing their doctor's appointments, and who don't like being unable to go out for over a month.  I have phoned Otis Canada a few times, but have never been able to get any information.  My wife has cancelled 8 physiotherapy appointments. (so far!)  Now the long weekend is coming up (Labour Day), people would like to move out.\n\nOne person wanted to move out 2 weeks ago.  He can't, because there's no elevator.  I find it extremely odd that Otis will not work for double or triple overtime or whatever.  I have sent the main office (not the Vancouver office) 3 emails, which they cannot be bothered to acknowledge, it seems; there is not even an automated reply.  I phoned the Vancouver office just now - put on hold, and then transferred to a different number, which didn't answer.  I phoned the Vancouver office again, and there was no answer.  We have had no information at all from Otis for about 2 weeks now.\n\nIt's incredible, really - there are about 60 apartments in this building, and no one knows when the elevator will be repaired, or even if it will be repaired ever.",

In the government liquor store similar if not the same taste for a Czech  or German  beer you pay 2.25 at the most. I tried it , it is fine ,but for the price they charge , never again. I guess that place is for people with deeper pockets ,not for me. Fix your prices or you will start loosing customers.",

The food was very bland, the patty of my burger way too thin and dry - almost burned, and basically there was just vegetables and an admittedly tasty brioche bun. Fries were good. I'm not expecting a gourmet burger at a brewery of course, but what I was served was unacceptably poor in quality, especially considering that it cost about 22-23$. Vibe of the place was ok, but definitely not a place I'd visit again if the philosophy behind it remains the same.

Laddie has tremendous technical knowledge, never stumped for a solution and vast up to date product information to always present to us best options. He provided and continues to provide us with step by step explanations of accessing systems/equipment, advised best options, price differentials, set up, etc. and virtually walks us through every aspect of our home alarm system, security cameras and fire protection. This constituted and still involves much time, effort, site and home visits and patience from Laddie and his staff to afford us this education and experience. Often we have had questions or concerns on a weekend and Laddie always responds and has surprisingly shown up at any time of day including evenings, Saturdays and Sundays to assist us. We believe this speaks volumes in addressing his character and the commitment of him and his company in providing an excellent service. We believe that reading reviews substantiates your evidence in the due diligence process, so we realize this and do not hesitate in recommending Laddie and Innova Security Systems.

The city is beautiful, the mountains, the water and the public transit are great.  I work out of the Kitchener, ON office, which is basically a development office.  Coming to the Richmond office is a treat, and I get to see all the people I Hip Chat, Skype, and VOIP to regularly.  It is a very nice and very big and bright office.

The city is beautiful, the mountains, the water and the public transit are great.  I work out of the Kitchener, ON office, which is basically a development office.  Coming to the Richmond office is a treat, and I get to see all the people I Hip Chat, Skype, and VOIP to regularly.  It is a very nice and very big and bright office.

The employees have worked hard for the company for nearly three months and have not made any mistakes. There is no problem with their ability to work. They can find any reason to fire employees. They only take advantage of legal loopholes. During the three-month probation period, employees can be fired without reason. It's legal, it's very unfair to us workers, a regulation is not a good company! It's best not to go again and change to a more humane unit! No wonder their company keeps recruiting newcomers to try out and then dismiss them, a vicious circle! Very contempt disgusting!\nThere is one more disgusting thing. Before entering the company, you have to have a medical examination and buy iron-toed shoes. We need to spend at least 50 for the physical examination to check for tuberculosis and get the report signed, etc., and 80 for the iron-toed shoe market. Their family paid 40 physical examinations and 70 iron-toed shoes for reimbursement. However, the reimbursement will only be granted after the probationary period has passed. So the decision is entirely in their hands. You did not make a mistake, if they want to fire you, they will fire you. And they won't reimburse you, and they will confidently say that the contract says that they will be reimbursed after the probationary period. What a shameless unit!",

I came across FoodPak by total coincidence when a truck with their logo on it drove past me on the highway last summer. I had just been discussing the issues we were having around sourcing the sustainable packaging we had hoped to use for our new products, when I turned and saw the FoodPak advertising right there on the truck in the lane beside me. That was the beginning of what has been the most positive and professional experience we have had as new entrepreneurs on this journey. Nick was so informative and patient with our high maintenance requests, and went above and beyond with sourcing and creating the perfect packaging to fit the vision of our brand.  He listened, then communicated his plan, and then executed on that plan on budget and ahead of schedule.  We are already excited about what we can create with FoodPak in the future and are so grateful for the outstanding customer service and product we received.  Thank you!",

Nice patio that's not on a loud, busy road. We had chicken strips and burgers and enjoyed them both. Out of the beers, I particularly liked the Session ale. We also scored some free deep-fried pickles when the kitchen closed as they made too many.

I had a lot of things on my wish list, and a lot of questions.\n\nI met with several vendors, and each one was different, but ADS was the only one where I was happy with the price, the service, and willingness to work with me to get everything exactly as I wanted it. Others would say \"no one does that, it's not possible\". ADS would say, \"interesting, let me get back to you!\" And they always got back to me, and they almost always had a solution. If it really was impossible, they helped me understand why.\n\nOf all the things I did for my house, making my home smart had the most details to work out. ADS helped me work out every last detail exactly as I would want it, with lots of good advice and suggestions.

I had a lot of things on my wish list, and a lot of questions.\n\nI met with several vendors, and each one was different, but ADS was the only one where I was happy with the price, the service, and willingness to work with me to get everything exactly as I wanted it. Others would say \"no one does that, it's not possible\". ADS would say, \"interesting, let me get back to you!\" And they always got back to me, and they almost always had a solution. If it really was impossible, they helped me understand why.\n\nOf all the things I did for my house, making my home smart had the most details to work out. ADS helped me work out every last detail exactly as I would want it, with lots of good advice and suggestions. And they are always very responsive to my questions, so I am reassured that if I need anything, they'll be there for me.\n\nAnd I love my smart home!\n\nNow, ADS' job is done, and I can confidently write this review, that they are awesome.

The hicup was the delay of the new roof installation on the facility.  As a result Tarum had to work closely with the roofing contractor to make sure his installation met the warranty requirements.  I have to say that Vancouver Solar did an exceptional job of doing quality work despite the obstacles.  Tarum took care of all permits & dealing with BC Hydro to join its grid.  He made sure that the job was done right.  We are pleased with the finished product & would highly recommend Vancouver Solar.",

Our roof has many segments and some skylights, which added complexity, but the installation was done well and looks very clean. There are no visible wires on the roof although the system has 9 separate panel locations. Tarum the owner made the whole process easy including the permit application and the setup for net metering with hydro. He was happy to give me detailed explanations on the types of solar, we went with optimizers and an inverter, and answered many questions of mine. We're now 2 months in and the system is working really well. We've had no issues and the app is easy to use. I'm so happy to see our credits at BC Hydro building up this summer for when we need it in the winter.\nIn the end I cannot recommend Vancouver Solar enough. Great job guys!",

I know that we dodged a huge bullet (a friend didn't know about a slow leaking pipe in their place and it cost them over $100,000 and almost a year in renovations).\n\nProvident has also let me into my own place (when I left my keys in Vancouver).  This saved my family and I over 4 hours of travelling time.\n\nProvident - you rock",

Provident personnel could not have done a better job  - from providing accurate and reassuring details in the initial phone call to us, to greeting us with empathy when we arrived at the house, boarding up the broken window and even cleaning up mud and glass from the interior of the house.  They walked us through what had happened and gave us tips to prevent further break-ins. These two Provident employees really helped offset our distress at being broken into and definitely exemplified the high standards advertised at Provident.  We cannot recommend them more highly.",

You should know that you must first order your food and drink before sitting down. Food is best ordered to share, even though the portion sizes aren't the biggest, they aren't the smallest either, nor are they the best presented dishes. For a brewery, this place has a decent kitchen, mostly fried offerings.  Where they really excel, is the choice and quality of beer! They definitely have something for every beer lover in terms of flavors. I typically like to sit on their outdoor patio, but the inside of the building is also a great spot to hang out. Overall, if you have a large group of people and want to catch up, this place will seat you almost immediately and will feed everyone, within a reasonable budget.",

They gave us over 40 large packing bins for packing (returnable), so we didn't need to get any boxes.They wrapped everything and they were working like machines. Yet, their prices are more than reasonable based on quality of their job and the timing. I always recommend Nash Moving to my clients for moving and to my friends and other realtors as well. Next time we move, Nash Moving is our to go company. Way to go guys! You definitely changed the way this industry works! Have you heard of people tipping movers before? Neither did I :)) And we sure did! These guys do amazing job and fully deserve to be tipped. That's how great they are! We recommend Nash Moving for your next move!",

The team was very thoughtful in where they put things and asked questions when they thought I may have a preference (since kitchen placement is so personal!). I especially appreciated how they removed all the boxes (from BBX moving), cardboard, and paper and put them in the carport, so the house felt ready to live in when they were done. So amazing!  (BBX Moving came and removed ALL the boxes and cardboard and trash the next day).\n\nLimor herself is always responsive, patient, and extremely pleasant to deal with. In the few times that I've worked with her, I  always get a sense that she works very hard, takes pride in her work, and has a very strong work ethic.\n\nAll in all, I would not hesitate to recommend them.

Limor and her team are amazing at what they do, and they provide courteous, caring service throughout. They come in with a plan, they hussle, and they get it done right! You won't go wrong in hiring them.\n\nWe began with an on-site consultation where Limor walked through the house, took notes, asked questions about priorities, and provided suggestions on how to proceed. We decided to utilize her team for packing as well as some unpacking services. I am so very glad we did.\n\nIt was critically important for us that we minimize the chaos of the move for Dad. He has memory issues that make any change to his environment frustrating and confusing for him. Limor proposed that we split packing across two days and leave the key pieces like Dad's bedroom and his tv room for the last moment. Also, they photographed Dad's space and when unpacking they essentially recreated it in our new place so that he immediately felt at home. It was brilliant!\n\nI wish I had taken photos of the boxes they packed so you could see the attention to detail in their work. We did not lose a single piece to breakage, and we had around 200 boxes of goods being moved. Everything was labelled and colour coded. And their art inventory service is such a great idea, I highly recommend taking advantage of that too.\n\nI'm not going to tell you it was cheap because frankly it wasn't. But let's get real here: we hired trained professionals to provide a skilled service that supported our move and made our lives so much easier. I can tell you with absolute conviction that it was money very well spent, and we received excellent value for our investment.",

After several phone calls, emails, texts it became apparent that they new less than nothing about installing a wall unit or anything else for that matter. Although we were told they were professionals, the installer asked what tools he needed and if we would help him put it up. Not sure, but thought that was what we were paying him for to install and know what tools to bring. It became very obvious that we were gong to be in for a terrible experience so cancelled and started searching for an alternative.\nI found First Lion online and thank you to all that have sent in their experiences and expressed their satisfaction because it was from those reviews that convinced me to go with First Lion. Spoke with Gabriel and was impressed with the very pertinent questions he asked, obviously knew what he was doing.\nMy experience: nothing short of absolute satisfaction. Extremely professional, knowledgeable, polite, hard working, perfect install. I expected to be pleased but was actually amazed. They are the only install company to use, bar none. More costly than Task Rabbit maybe, but worth every penny and more. They said they would arrive at 10am, they arrived at 9:50 and were working by 10. They finished at about 3 and although I asked them to take a break they politely declined and kept working. Gabriel and Brent were just two great hard working guys and deserve to get the kind of reviews that are listed here.\nDo yourself a favour and skip the stress of a poor install and just get First Lion to do it right the first time and sit back and enjoy.\nCan't say enough about them, really, awesome company.",

It was quite busy at the show with many woman in front of me at their booth looking at their lovely things they had to showcase and sell. It included their stuffed animals (warm buddies) , cozy robes and other warming bottles. Everyone was touching and feeling and when it was my turn I asked the woman how much the teddy bears were. She replied in a very rude tone \"they're all a different price\". Ok well how much is this one I asked, I would like to buy it for my daughter. $20 dollars! She said rudely and so I handed it to my daughter and went to get my wallet when she said \"give me that one back or pay for it first if you want to see anything else, nobody wants to buy one that a child has touched\". I was so shocked! So shocked. And so were the other women (whom I didn't know). They all put the items down that they were looking at it. And one woman said that's the rudest thing someone could've said. Especially a salesperson trying to sell their product! A child's product ! I was not only embarrassed and mortified about the situation, but my daughter was so upset when I told her I'm sorry we aren't going to buy this anymore. 15 minutes later when I was walking around a woman from a different booth approached me and said she was so sorry for what that woman said to me and my daughter. It was so extremely rude and unprofessional. They really should not have this woman representing their company. ( she was wearing a lime green long sleeve underneath her black vest with short hair)  Hopefully the owner reads this and addresses this issue so it never happens again to anyone else. I can't imagine anyone wanting to support a company like this. I know I can't.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank Karen for replying to me. I do accept your apology and I can understand that it was quite busy and probably would've added to your probably stressful day. I was just really wanting to buy a warm buddy for my daughter. Thank you so very much for your offer of sending her a warm buddy, she will be so happy about this.",

Steelhead is either able to remote in or walk us through a problem in about 10-15 minutes or they have someone onsite in about 4 hours, which is critical in tax time.  One time with one of the competitors we had to buy a small printer from Staples because they were going to be days to fix a problem.  Days.  In tax season.  Really!  My office manager has just told me we're never switching because she can at least talk with a person at Steelhead.

I wanted something sturdy & not flimsy! I am so impressed. I received my portfolio today & couldn't be happier.\n\nMine is Acrylic Matte in Black with engraving & color fill. But they have different material options, like aluminum or veneer if you don't like acrylic, they have tons of different engraving  options with or without color.\n\nThe customer service is amazing! You send them your file and they work with you to get it perfect. Also the website is very user friendly. The best part: every portfolio includes overnight shipping, once it's done in production.\n\nBelow is the \"cover\" I haven't put my prints in yet. No filters\n\n#supportsmallbusinesses",

But they have different material options, like aluminum or veneer if you don't like acrylic, they have tons of different engraving  options with or without color.\n\nThe customer service is amazing! You send them your file and they work with you to get it perfect. Also the website is very user friendly. The best part: every portfolio includes overnight shipping, once it's done in production.\n\nBelow is the \"cover\" I haven't put my prints in yet. No filters\n\n#supportsmallbusinesses",

This is 100% part of the leather.  The upside of vegetable tan leather is that it patinas over time and ages beautifully, darkening and evening out completely.  We note on our website that all of our leather will have natural blemishes as this is the very nature of leather.\n\nWe understand that mistakes happen although this is not one of them.  Please allow for the vegetable tan leather to take its course and patina, which will add beauty and character to your portfolio book and case.",

They were always very professional and friendly. Willing to help accommodate any of my needs.\n\nWords cannot describe how AMAZING my book came out. So much better then what I imagined!! So sleek and professional! Packaged perfectly and so cute and personalized with my name all over the wrapping which definitely made me feel special.

Spread 'Em's chef is always coming up with new offerings like olive oil and herb marinated vegan soft cheeses and a Philly-style \"cream cheeze\" that quickly became my new favourite (it is divine on sourdough toast with sliced tomato and cucumber).

On the day of the appointment, they called 11 am to reschedule for the following week (same time slot) because a technician was sick.\n\nFor the second appointment, I waited for an hour and no one called or showed up.  When I called their office, the representative (Carlos) said that he would check and someone would call me back.  An hour and a half later, no one called.  When I called again, another representative (Stephanie) told me they could not make it that day.

I rejected the offer saying that the credit is of no use to me if no body shows up for the service call as agreed.  She assured me that she would personally notify me about the new appointment.\n\nOn the day of the THIRD appointment, I traveled to my parent's place again and waited an hour.  No call arrived from Ashton!  When I called them, the representative (Carlos) told me he would check and call me back.  And no one did!  When I called the office again, another representative (Erin) told me that I got the time wrong and the appointment should have been the next day.  I told her to check with Stephanie, who offered me the credit and new appointment.  Erin kept saying that I got the time wrong.  At that point, I told her to cancel my appointment and I will take my business elsewhere.  She simply said OK.\n\nFunny enough, about half an hour later, Erin (I think) called me back and apologized that the technician could not make it and offered to reschedule it for the next day.  I told her that altogether I wasted more than 10 hours waiting for service and they need to change their business practice.  And I told her I will take my business elsewhere for a second time.\n\nIf you need reliable service, find another shop!",

I have seen the inner workings of a lot of consulting companies, and HHT is genuinely in a league of its own. It all comes down to excellence, inclusiveness, and fun.\n\nFirst, excellence. This is a company that seeks out unique, challenging work that most other EE companies can't handle. This is a sharp, elite team that is brought in on complex projects where human lives are at risk and safety is paramount. This can be seen in their projects - roller coasters, deep-sea submarines, and more.\n\nSecond, inclusiveness. Diversity is good, but it's really inclusiveness that matters. I saw how deeply this runs in HHT's DNA. On my last day in the office and at the end of a successful project, I wanted to pick up a few bottles of champagne for the team. I mentioned this to the president, Mike, and he kindly mentioned, \"don't forget to pick up some de-alcoholized bubbles, too.\" I had completely overlooked the fact that there were team members that do not drink. It was absolutely front-of-mind for Mike that everyone gets to be included.\n\nAnd speaking of fun, there is a reason you see so many smiles on LinkedIn and Twitter posts. Be it games of Coup at lunch, team events, monthly food culture events, or Friday runs to the DL Chicken Shack, there is a welcoming nature to this team that puts a smile on your face plus they can solve the really challenging problems.",

Could you remind me what your company is and what you came to us looking for? I would be the first to admit that we do suggest to some people who talk to us that we are not a perfect fit when it either makes more sense to hire someone internally or go with an individual rather than an integrated engineering team, but I don't recall ever turning someone away without a good explanation of why it might more sense to take a different strategy. Many other firms may be more likely to take on the work even if it isn't the best move for the client. Are you sure it was our company that you talked to? Again, I'm sorry that we did not get a chance to work together and I hope that you have been successful with your venture.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJosh Usher",
