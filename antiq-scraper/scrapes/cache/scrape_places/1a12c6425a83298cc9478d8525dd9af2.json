I don't mind waiting here, I said nicely. I rolled up my window and sat there on my phone. They had a long line in drive through. My burgers came within 30 seconds. Lol I hate it I dunno y they make me wait most times for a normal order. I'm not ordering the pizza or anything out of the ordinary. So loophole just hold the line up. LOL THEY HAVE TO PRIORITIZE YOU AND GET THE LINE MOVING. And as I was taught. The customer service. It's a virus. If ONE person has bad service it can spread, possibly this someone who has been there a long time with seniority? I do believe it can trickle down. Well if he's being lazy then I'm being lazy.

Kinda frustrating as I'm sure they could rather easily accommodated my order but instead choice to turn me away.

Despite being in line before the breakfast cutoff and only being 2 minutes passed 11am I was told the breakfast menu was no longer available. Kinda frustrating as I'm sure they could rather easily accommodated my order but instead choice to turn me away. This is the first time I've been to a McDonald's location in a while and now I remember why.",

This makes no sense to me I've never been to a restaurant where you're willing to pay for a product and they say no to you especially if it's just WATER. Especially when you're spending 30 to $40 each time just for two people you would expect better service. I hope management gets involved in actually makes a difference and teaches these people customer service it seems that customer service has gone down the drain. The employees act annoyed to serve you. It's super sad. I miss the good old days of good customer service. Not a Karen just want basic customer service.",

It looked really gross and another thing was it felt like it was in the freezer and it was defrosting and they gave it to me. It looks like a disaster. It was so disgusting looking at it. I ended up throwing it out into the bush for the birds to eat and I feel bad for them and my coffee. I just dumped it out and just went over to Tim Hortons after and I actually got a hot coffee and a really nice muffin way to go McDonald's anyways everybody have a wonderful day thank you for taking the time to read this",

The chicken tasted old. Absolutely disgusting.\n\nThird review since this McDonald's keeps deleting them since they don't like hearing the truth!!\n\nIn short:\n\nAlways check your order before you leave because they usually mess it up and forget something or give you the wrong item.\n\nThe food quality is horrendous and does not meet the franchise standards. You might receive a burger with barely any sauce, bread will be burnt, fries are half full and upside down in the bag, etc.\n\nThe facility is usually dirty.\n\nStaff are cranky and never know what they are doing.\n\nI've sent in complaints to McDonald's via Twitter and email and they have responded and told me they will be following up with this location.",

They told me this location is already flagged and on their radar. I took the chance and ordered two breakfast sandwiches today and one of them was wrong, and the other had ZERO sauce. The chicken tasted old. Absolutely disgusting.\n\nThird review since this McDonald's keeps deleting them since they don't like hearing the truth!!\n\nIn short:\n\nAlways check your order before you leave because they usually mess it up and forget something or give you the wrong item.\n\nThe food quality is horrendous and does not meet the franchise standards. You might receive a burger with barely any sauce, bread will be burnt, fries are half full and upside down in the bag, etc.\n\nThe facility is usually dirty.\n\nStaff are cranky and never know what they are doing.\n\nI've sent in complaints to McDonald's via Twitter and email and they have responded and told me they will be following up with this location.",

A fry burger and a pop. How sad it is that they cannot have enough food ready to go. I understand that demand is higher at certain times but 25 minutes from order to getting food is ridiculous. And when you refuse to be parked you get even worse service because now you are going against the normal, it's a drive thru and I should have to pull over and wait. While I sat and waited for my order 6 to 7 vehicles were parked so they can make their time for drive thru.  Truly terrible management for thinking this is acceptable to treat customers like this.\n\nAfter receiving my order my fry level is laughable. Ordered junior McChicken extra mayo and received my mcchicken with no mayo\n\nHow do you mess that up.\nCompletely unacceptable.\n\nCorporate McDonald's needs to review this location and it's management for customer service and drive thru operations.",

Then very direct rude signs from the tyrant management. They also closed the top section because they already don't ever cleanup.\n\nI haven't been here in years, but I used to love this location and now I am appalled. The staff even looked as if they were dead inside. Clearly there is an issue with the owner or manager and corporate is not aware of the situation.\n\nThis location used to be packed and is now dismal at best.",
