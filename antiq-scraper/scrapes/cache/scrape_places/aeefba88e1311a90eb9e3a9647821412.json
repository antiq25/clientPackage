Parking wasn't too bad for an urban area.\n\nOnly complaint is one morning, I think they only had one elevator running, and we literally waited on our floor for an elevator for about 15 minutes (5 minutes for the first which was already full, then another 10 for the second which had room). But I think that was a short lived problem, the rest of the stay we didn't have any issues.",

The only criticism I'd give was the room was marketed as \"top floor city view\" and my window literally looked out onto the roof. Not much of a city view however the room itself was quite nice.

Upon checking in we were greeted by staff who had seen us pull into the parking lot and park our car. They had also heard us talking about the parking lot and that we were impressed to find parking that late in the evening, as it took a very long time to check in. Upon checking in they asked all the usual questions. The hotel proceeded to text all throughout the night and next morning making sure everything was fine with our stay, which it was for the most part. We spent the evening coming and going from the hotel and making multiple trips to our vehicle which was parked in view from the lobby with the staff that had checked us in hours prior, and a friendly door person who checked on us each time which we appreciated as two young female travelers. The next morning we woke up early and when to grab something from the car, to find that the car was gone. We went back inside and had staff tell us that they had got the car towed because it was illegally parked. We went to retrieve the car and had to navigate our way around a large unfamiliar city to a not so nice side of town and had to pay over $160 for less then 12 hours of the car being there. Once we retrieved the car and found our way back to the hotel I went back in to figure out parking. I had to wait for the three staff members to bring out two more staff members before I even got to speak to them. Once their crew of five was ready I asked them what was up with the parking and why nobody had mentioned that we needed to purchase a ticket for parking and why nobody had bothered to tell us our car was being taken. They did don't have a response. They then tried to charge us extra for parking the night our car got towed, to which one of the workers told the person billing me to be nice and not overcharge. This was a horrible experience as we were on a time sensitive trip and this completely ruined our day timing wise. We had stayed there before with male counterparts and were treated much better, but when it was two young female they feel the need to try and get more money out of us and deceive us.",

Every single detail was thought out -whether we needed to borrow an umbrella to walk to dinner or borrow bikes, they had it all. The kindest staff ever and always willing to go above and beyond (I wish I remembered specific names but honestly it was everyone)! So so accommodating and provided awesome recommendations. We also loved the access to the restaurant/bar and we didn't hear any music or noise from our room on the 5th floor. The room was spacious, clean and luxurious. We loved the cute details and decor in both the lobby and room. Not to mention the location was great and we were walking distance to all restaurants/activities we wanted to try. I could not recommend this hotel more!! We will be coming back and recommending to all of our friends.",
