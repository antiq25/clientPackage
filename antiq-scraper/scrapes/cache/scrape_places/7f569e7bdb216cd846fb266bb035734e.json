Again, it's just a portion of what they do.\n\nThe fish and chips are solid and the batter is not too thick. Got takeout and ate it 20 minutes later and was still crispy. Recommend calling the order in , especially if it's getting close to lunch time as there is a high school close by and it can get crowded. People talk about the fries and they are good. For value and quantity, it definitely hits the spot. Also tried the curries eggplant halibut wrap. It was good. Maybe a bit mild for my tastes but for those wanting that light curry flavour with their fish, this would work for you.\n\nParking in the complex , with the highschool crowd etc...can be a bit of a slog depending on the time.

The fish was delicious, crispy and fresh as expected. We tried sockeye salmon fish, with potato fries, coleslaw salad. We also had the yummy bisque for the first time (a thick seafood fish soup ) with some garlic bread.\nThe prices were very reasonable. Great portion size. The fish and chips dinner is enough for teo people. I will visit this place again for trying the other fish cuisines.",

We got the halibut and chips - fish tasted so fresh, was flaky in the inside and had a great exterior crunch. I must say though, the chips (i.e. fries), was the star of the dish for me - they were cooked to perfection. Crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, every single one of them. Service was quick and the patio atmosphere with a good view just makes this place that much better. It's about a 5min walk from Granville Island. 10000000% would recommend this place to anyone that loves good food.",

I must say though, the chips (i.e. fries), was the star of the dish for me - they were cooked to perfection. Crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, every single one of them. Service was quick and the patio atmosphere with a good view just makes this place that much better. It's about a 5min walk from Granville Island. 10000000% would recommend this place to anyone that loves good food.",

The batter was crispy, fish was moist, perfectly seasoned! It was soooooo good, really hit the spot! Tartar sauce was light and refreshing, not heavy at all. I craved this again 3-4 times that same day, I'm still thinking about it today!\n\nWe also got the scallop, grilled, over rice, with garlic butter! Scallop was also perfectly cooked! Sweet and juicy! I enjoyed dipping the scallop in the butter and adding tartar sauce to the rice for the perfect bite!\n\nFood was a little slow but we went right when they open so it was understandable. I appreciate that the chef take his time to prepare the food properly instead of rushing them out.\n\nService was friendly and casual, very warm and welcoming! We enjoyed our conversation with them and our time there. This was also the first time we took our puppy to a restaurant, we were glad it was a pleasant experience.\n\nTheir supplies came late that day and we couldn't order what we originally wanted, but we would definitely be back for other dishes. What we ended up ordering turn out great though, so no complain there! But next time we want to try cod fish& chips, grilled calamari, and clam chowder. :)\n\nWe wish they have deep fried oysters too, I think it will be amazing!",

We started with the grilled calamari with garlic butter which was a great combo. I had a Greek salad with 1pc fish and chips. He had the grilled salmon on rice. For dessert we tried their chocolate cake (they didn't have anymore carrot cake). It's understandable that some menu items wouldn't be available due to the freshness of the food so we didn't get a chance to try their crab cakes or clam chowder. I would highly recommend the fish and chips, the snapper was very light and battered perfectly. Overall I'm happy we visited and I would definitely go back if I visit BC again :)",

One of our group vowed that she didn't like Salmon but she sure enjoyed this Salmon Burger and is now a 'convert'.  The $15 cost was well worth it for a freshly grilled generous Salmon portion~ hope we get to enjoy the same next year!  A small favour ~ It would be nice to have the option of different types of Buns, besides a White Bun ~ thank you!",

The interior is pretty basic and nothing to write home about, but the food was delicious and service quick. I got the halibut which was fried to perfection - crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside. The fries and coleslaw were also fantastic though I would've liked a bit more slaw because it was so good. Husband got the regular fish (we're assuming cod) which was also delicious and cheaper than halibut. He got the chowder with his combo which lacked salt but was an easy fix and would be good for those trying to be mindful of their salt intake. We were the only customers for a while on a Tuesday at lunch so you wouldn't have to wait long if you're in a rush. We will definitely be back!",

Booking reservations was easy but we did wish we could have sat up in the roof top patio (if you do happy hour you could not book up there). We pretty much order everything on the happy hour menu to start us off and then proceed to order our dinner after. The food was great everything is fresh and tasted good. We had their raw oyster and cold seafood platter, with some other sides such as their beef ribs and calamari. We follow that up with some steaks and fish. Over all great place for drinks and dinner.",

Booking reservations was easy but we did wish we could have sat up in the roof top patio (if you do happy hour you could not book up there). We pretty much order everything on the happy hour menu to start us off and then proceed to order our dinner after. The food was great everything is fresh and tasted good. We had their raw oyster and cold seafood platter, with some other sides such as their beef ribs and calamari. We follow that up with some steaks and fish. Over all great place for drinks and dinner.",

Food came out very quick so kudos to the back of the house for keeping things moving during happy hour!\n\nWe got lobster rolls, truffle fries, fish tacos, and 2 of each regular oyster and premium oyster.\nFor drinks we ordered their red sangria (rotating basis presumably between red and white wines) and a non-alcoholic local hazy IPA. We aren't big drinkers so won't go into detail, nevertheless they were both refreshing and tasty drinks that paired well with our food choices.\n\nThe lobster roll was great, you can taste the freshness of the lobster meat itself. This was something we did not find in the lobsters we've personally had around Toronto. The dressing and small cuts of veggies did well to complement and complete the lobster roll.\n\nTruffle fries were well seasoned, being able to get hints of truffle (presumably from truffle oil) every other bite or so. The aioli paired well with the fries as well.\n\nFish tacos were fresh, the flavor and texture of the coleslaw went well to balance out the grease of a fried fish fillet. I probably could have gone for another order but didn't want to risk a permanent food coma.\n\nOne set of oysters tasted more of the ocean than the other. Going by what the wait staff pointed out as the regular vs premium, the latter had the more ocean-y briney taste. Not for everyone especially if you aren't a fan of seafood, but if you dabble then these are definitely worth a try at a reasonable price.\n\nAll in all, we were thoroughly impressed with all aspects of our visit.

She mentioned the uni was firm and that made me go for it (I've had some bad experiences with this delicacy). It was delicious.\n\nOrdered many different dishes - Sun Seeker, Sweet Select, and Kumamoto oysters were all delicious and fresh. One of them were very meaty. The horseradish is freshly grated. Lobster poutine was packed with lobster but pretty meh overall. Crab cake was a bit dry. 6pc scallop was seared to perfection. The tuna tartare was a bit salty, but still tasted good. The octopus was amazing and tender. And of course as mentioned earlier, the uni was the best and most fresh I've ever had.\n\nThe wife says they make an amazing espresso martini. Definitely get a reservation as this spot was packed on a Monday night. They have fresh oysters that you can take home if you like to shuck (who doesn't like to shuck)? When I visit Vancouver again, I will definitely be stopping by.",

She mentioned the uni was firm and that made me go for it (I've had some bad experiences with this delicacy). It was delicious.\n\nOrdered many different dishes - Sun Seeker, Sweet Select, and Kumamoto oysters were all delicious and fresh. One of them were very meaty. The horseradish is freshly grated. Lobster poutine was packed with lobster but pretty meh overall. Crab cake was a bit dry. 6pc scallop was seared to perfection. The tuna tartare was a bit salty, but still tasted good. The octopus was amazing and tender. And of course as mentioned earlier, the uni was the best and most fresh I've ever had.\n\nThe wife says they make an amazing espresso martini. Definitely get a reservation as this spot was packed on a Monday night. They have fresh oysters that you can take home if you like to shuck (who doesn't like to shuck)? When I visit Vancouver again, I will definitely be stopping by.",

Some dishes were a bit oily.\n\nMy favourite was their fish maw baked with running chicken - the flavours were very complementary and the fish maw was cooked just right.\n\nThe restaurant isn't that nice looking; decor is simple and a bit dated, with tables fairly placed close together. They have two private rooms. It has a little bit of a hole-in-the-wall feeling but prices certainly were at par if not even more expensive than other restaurants with much nicer decor.\n\nWorth it to come back for the food, but not necessarily to present to visitors given the overall ambiance and dining experience.",

It's located in a rather non-descript mini mall on Marine.\n\nThe interior isn't huge and they sat us at one of the few small tables in the restaurant. We ordered the Mixed Vegetables, Mui Choy Kau Yuk,\nHouse Special Fried Rice, and we wanted to order a crab dish. They tried to convince us that we ordered too much... As it turns out, they mistakenly gave us the wrong crab dish. We ordered a simple ginger and green onion crab but they wound up giving us their special Fire Crab with Sticky Rice. The reason why they call it that is because they pour some liquid on the sticky rice and set it on fire tableside. While it wasn't what we ordered, it turned out pretty good with a spicy garlic soy flavour.\n\nService was pretty good and food was tasty. Ended the meal with a taro tapioca dessert.",

We even over heard one of the servers ( or owner ) saying to another worker that they were relieved we were finally leaving. Probably because we were not spending \"that much\" for dinner.... And could finally fill our table with other people. No I will never set foot in this restaurant again or any future establishments the owner  opens in the future.  By no means is this review meant to defame the restaurant, maybe they were just feeling too stressed from the covid restrictions and really needed the money.  but to be treated based on how much we are willing to spend on a meal simply is a first... oh and y'all wondering how much the meal cost, it was a little over $300 with 12% tips ( why did I tip? Because it's not the servers faults they give that kind of service, more likely how the owner teaches the servers how to serve higher value customers)",

The restaurant gets quite busy during lunch, I would suggest plan accordingly and come after the lunch rush. The restaurant holds about 20 people or less, the ambiance is that of a fish spot with seafood art on the walls. Since this was our first stop in Granville Island and wanted to try and see everything, we decided to share the clam chowder and the infamous fish and Chips! Great customer service, daughter was our server, mother washing dishes very humble people. If you are in a hurry, I wouldn't suggest coming here, everything is made fresh to order so it'll take a min. The food was hot and absolutely delicious, one of the best fish and chips around!",

The restaurant's inviting ambiance and friendly staff immediately set the stage for a memorable dining experience. With a diverse menu boasting a variety of seafood delicacies, our taste buds were in for a treat.\n\nTo start, we ordered the Caesar Salad, and it was a refreshing and well-balanced dish. The crisp romaine lettuce was generously coated in a tangy dressing, complemented by a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and crunchy croutons. It served as an excellent precursor to the seafood feast that awaited us.  I will note a pretty standard caesar salad.\n\nNext up was the Seafood Sampler, a delightful platter brimming with ocean treasures. The array of Seafood Clams, Mussels, Prawns and Scallops with breaded Oysters and deep fried Cod was impeccably fresh and expertly prepared. The sampler was a great way to explore various flavours of the sea in one dish.\n\nThe Clam Chowder was a standout among the starters. Creamy, rich, and generously loaded with tender clams, it warmed our souls and left us craving more. The balance of flavours was spot on, and the hearty portion made it perfect for sharing.\n\nMoving on to the Prawn Appetizer, we were delighted by the succulent prawns cooked to perfection. The dish was accented with a zesty marinade that enhanced the natural sweetness of the prawns. It was an appetizer we couldn't resist finishing entirely, even though we knew we had a main course to savour.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was undoubtedly the Cioppino, a seafood stew packed with an array of fish, mussels, and squid. The broth was a harmonious symphony of tomatoes, garlic, and herbs that danced on our palates with every spoonful. The seafood was tender, indicating the use of fresh catch, and the dish was served piping hot, adding to its comforting appeal. Although it may seem simple, this dish showcased Tony's expertise in crafting seafood classics.\n\nOverall, Tony's Fish & Oyster Cafe earns a solid 4-star rating. The dining experience was enhanced not only by the delectable seafood offerings but also by the warm and attentive service provided by the sever. While some dishes stood out more than others, the restaurant's commitment to quality and flavoursome seafood left a lasting impression on our taste buds. Tony's Fish & Oyster Cafe is a worthy destination to satisfy your cravings.",

With a diverse menu boasting a variety of seafood delicacies, our taste buds were in for a treat.\n\nTo start, we ordered the Caesar Salad, and it was a refreshing and well-balanced dish. The crisp romaine lettuce was generously coated in a tangy dressing, complemented by a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and crunchy croutons. It served as an excellent precursor to the seafood feast that awaited us.  I will note a pretty standard caesar salad.\n\nNext up was the Seafood Sampler, a delightful platter brimming with ocean treasures. The array of Seafood Clams, Mussels, Prawns and Scallops with breaded Oysters and deep fried Cod was impeccably fresh and expertly prepared. The sampler was a great way to explore various flavours of the sea in one dish.\n\nThe Clam Chowder was a standout among the starters. Creamy, rich, and generously loaded with tender clams, it warmed our souls and left us craving more. The balance of flavours was spot on, and the hearty portion made it perfect for sharing.\n\nMoving on to the Prawn Appetizer, we were delighted by the succulent prawns cooked to perfection. The dish was accented with a zesty marinade that enhanced the natural sweetness of the prawns. It was an appetizer we couldn't resist finishing entirely, even though we knew we had a main course to savour.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was undoubtedly the Cioppino, a seafood stew packed with an array of fish, mussels, and squid. The broth was a harmonious symphony of tomatoes, garlic, and herbs that danced on our palates with every spoonful. The seafood was tender, indicating the use of fresh catch, and the dish was served piping hot, adding to its comforting appeal. Although it may seem simple, this dish showcased Tony's expertise in crafting seafood classics.\n\nOverall, Tony's Fish & Oyster Cafe earns a solid 4-star rating. The dining experience was enhanced not only by the delectable seafood offerings but also by the warm and attentive service provided by the sever. While some dishes stood out more than others, the restaurant's commitment to quality and flavoursome seafood left a lasting impression on our taste buds. Tony's Fish & Oyster Cafe is a worthy destination to satisfy your cravings.",

The malpeque and beausoleil  were harvested on the 15th and 18th respectively.\n\nPlease reach out via email orders@dailycatchseafood.ca , we would love to make it up to the both of you!\n\nwarm regards,\n\n",

We were blown away by the customer service and knowledge of the staff. We ended up getting steak fillets, halibut, tuna and shrimp. Everything was fantastic! My brother owns a seafood restaurant so I am very particular when it comes to seafood and the quality. After the seafood de thawed it had a sweet smell with no \"fishyness\". I was able to make raw poke with the tuna and it was divine. Would 100% recommend Daily catch and now we place bi weekly orders so daily catch has been crucial towards us leading a healthier lifestyle with amazing seafood! Thank you Daily Catch!",

When the staff were asked about the situation, the one helping you, thought you had asked \"If the fish was Cut Today\" and because it was he replied \"yes\". When you asked him \"if it was previously frozen\" he replied \"it was\" not because he was changing his mind or lying earlier but because in his mind he wasn't asked if it was fresh or frozen yet. The staff who was helping you has worked for us for a long time and knows that the salmon right now is not fresh, there is no incentive for him to lie about it so I honestly believe this is a miss communication on our part. Occasionally staff might miss-hear what a customer is saying, we serve thousands of customers a week so its bound to happen every once in a while. \n We are extremely transparent about our products. We don't hide the fact that this time of year we sell previously frozen wild Salmon as there is no fresh wild pacific salmon available for commercial purposes for several more months. All Wild Salmon being sold outside of Fresh Season is always going to be previously frozen, unless it is farmed. Our store Signage is also usually very accurate and products that are Fresh will say so. The more transparent we are the better business we become. Our employees have no incentive lying about our products it would only get them in trouble if done in anyway that isn't an honest mistake. For this reason and the employee in questions vast knowledge on our products I believe this was an honest mistake.\n As for the frozen Salmon its by far the highest quality Sockeye you can purchase outside of fresh season. We pay a lot more for it so that we can sell it with a smile knowing the quality is superb, we can guarantee you will enjoy it!\n We would love to here more from you as well as refund your purchase, Please Email us at Orders@dailycatchseafood.ca so we can connect, Thank You",

The place was very accommodating about letting us move our reservation up a bit from when we originally set it. The place is very beautiful, well decorated and very elegant yet cozy. We sat on the enclosed patio and the temperature was perfect, not to mention the ivy covered lanterns giving soft romantic light to the room. We were given a hand written congratulations from the restaurant, which was a very sweet personal touch. Our server, Phillip, was engaging, charming, and was very well versed on the menu. Any question he couldn't answer he was quick to ask the kitchen. He also checked in with us all night and was constantly refilling our waters. It was a very royal treatment we did not expect at that price point, for certain. We got the two tier seafood platter, the scallops entre, and a beef tenderloin to split. Not only were they very attentive to my dairy allergy, and my wife's peanut allergy, but everything we tried exceeded our expectations. Never had jellyfish before here and I would for certain try it again. The oysters were fresh and absolutely something I was excited for as an oyster lover, I was not disappointed. In terms of accessibility I'd say very for a wheelchair, but I was having a good day so walked in with my cane. The parking is subject to downtown and I didn't see a disabled spot, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. Likely just filled before we got there. However they do offer valet services. They are very accommodating if you call ahead. Definitely recommend this place to seafood lovers looking for a nice elegant date spot.",

The parking is subject to downtown and I didn't see a disabled spot, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. Likely just filled before we got there. However they do offer valet services. They are very accommodating if you call ahead. Definitely recommend this place to seafood lovers looking for a nice elegant date spot.",

It was pretty empty so I don't think there's a need for reservations unless you want to reserve a particular dish like we did.\n\nThe highlight of the night was definitely the pigeon, the melon soup and the sweet and sour pork.\n\nThe pigeon was really crispy and juicy at the same time. Perfectly salted and delicious (no Pic as it was grabbed at quickly)\n\nThe melon soup was so full of goods that I don't think it should be called a soup and instead it should be considered a meal. There was craband scallops inside. The soup was so sweet not in a fake sugary kind of way but a savory and seafood kind of way. Would recommend if money is of no object\n\nThe sweet and sour pork was surprisingly good. Crispy on the outside. Perfect balance of sweet and salty. The meat wasn't dry but instead very crisp in a good way.\n\nOverall the food here was pretty good. Not overly salty and didn't make me drink loads of water afterwards. The service was friendly and fast. My dirty plates were switched out every time a shell landed on it. The prices are appropriate for the amount of food and quality of food. Would definitely recommend the pigeon and sweet and sour pork. The atmosphere was nice because only half the restaurant was full. People were well spaced out and lots of wait staff to help.",

We had two very nice attentive waiters serving us. The atmosphere is lovely and lively, and the patio is pleasant. The food was very good but lacking the wow factor I was expecting, and my friend thought the same. I think part of the reason is, the bar is now set so high by all the good places to eat in this city. We had the mussels, halibut cheeks, hand cut fries and pea tips. The best mussels I've had still remains those at Locals restaurant in Courtenay. The best halibut cheeks my friend has had still remains at the now closed West restaurant in Vancouver. It was my first time trying halibut cheeks so I was quite excited, but they were somewhat bland and to me, the texture made it seem like it could have been from any part of the fish. They were served with tartar sauce and pickles which was interesting. Very small serving size for a $50 entree; not enough for one person if you're hungry. I filled up on fries and bread instead. My friend is a huge pea tips fan and as I predicted, he prefers the traditional Chinese method of cooking them, with more subtle flavouring and more garlic. I agree that method allows the bitterness and flavour of the pea tips to shine. But the soy sauce / sesame oil variation at Oddfish was still nice. In my opinion, the best part of the meal was the hand cut fries, the aioli it was served with, and the carbonated water made on their in-house machine. Very good carbonated water. All in all, I'd go back, but I wouldn't run back.",

The place was fully booked the only place available for us was in the heated patio area. The patio areas had plenty of heat lamps and the place was fully closed off so you won't need to worry about rain or snow (we were here during March and it actually snowed during our dinner!)\n\nThe food was pretty good, we ordered tiger shrimp cocktails, grilled oysters, assorted sashimi platter, seared scallops and a bowl of clams. Our favourite was the seared scallops hands down. We also orders some vegetable dish and they were amazing too! The beets with avocado and warm goat cheese was out of this world! The portion was kind of small so consider yourself warned. But the quality was certainly worthy of the price tag.\n\nWould come back again!",

Shortly after, a person who appeared to be the manager came out with a smile and asked me, \"What would you like to order?\" I ordered two appetizers, Signature Wok Squid and Fried Oysters. He also suggested that I could get a portion of steamed rice or fried rice to go along with them.I sat on a chair by the harbor and started tasting a few bites. Both the squid and oyster were very fresh, and the squid had a great flavor. Paired with white rice, it was just right. The dipping sauce for the fried oyster had a hint of orange sweetness, and it was delicious. I definitely need to go back to the restaurant, sit on that beautiful patio, and enjoy another seafood meal.",

Quick service I guess with the time we went there, a little early for dinner. Table at the booth we sat down has a huge hole in it, washroom was really dark and dirty with sauce splat on the headboard Liked our server as she is attentive. Couple of stars off because 1. We ordered a plain fries for the kids but we got a season one that's a little spicy for little kids. 2. It gave me an upset stomach after I ate here that never happened to any seafood places I've been to.\nMight as well go to other boil places for better experience and atmosphere.

But anyways, we paid full but this \"small\" mistake was very expensive, just have better customer service! If she would have accepted her mistake and maybe even apologized we could've understand but acting like the way she did, was not ok.",

The rack of lamb is always cooked to perfection and the mashed potatoes is to die for because it's not like any mashed potatoes I've ever had its sweet but savory at the same time. The portions are big plenty of veggies on the plate and presentation is always beautiful. The seafood pasta is so delish! I love the variety and amount of seafood that it comes with. Today my friend and I shared the mushroom soup. It was one of the features of the night and it was the best mushroom soup I've ever tasted! Rich, creamy and packed with flavor! I loved how the mushroom was blended but u can still taste the mushrooms and it had a nice garlic flavor.

                    "review_text": "I love coming to Pink Peppercorn and it never disappoints! Every time I come i always rotate with the rack of lamb or the seafood pasta. The rack of lamb is always cooked to perfection and the mashed potatoes is to die for because it's not like any mashed potatoes I've ever had its sweet but savory at the same time. The portions are big plenty of veggies on the plate and presentation is always beautiful. The seafood pasta is so delish! I love the variety and amount of seafood that it comes with. Today my friend and I shared the mushroom soup. It was one of the features of the night and it was the best mushroom soup I've ever tasted! Rich, creamy and packed with flavor! I loved how the mushroom was blended but u can still taste the mushrooms and it had a nice garlic flavor. I wish it was a permanent item on the menu I'd take this mushroom soup over the clam chowder anytime! Our servers Arturo and Teddy bear both give great service with a great sense of humor! Hopefully next time I'll try something else off the menu!",

Others had the New York steak, cedar planked salmon, the salmon Wellington, and rack of lamb. Everyone was super happy with their meals. We also ordered the calamari starter, which was very fresh! The meal came with their complimentary warm bread and lobster oil, which was divine.\n\nThe star was our server. The lone man appeared to be working the entire restaurant alone.

An August visit to the Kingsway dining spot refreshed happy memories of The Cannery.\nFrom the initial greeting to our departure, service was friendly and attentive, without being intrusive. To start, we enjoyed bread and the signature Lobster Oil dip with balsamic vinegar. She had mushroom and roasted garlic soup, I had lobster bisque. Both delicious. Her entree was Sablefish with a lemon butter sauce, mine was Salmon Wellington. Each came with asparagus and broccoli, perfectly cooked to tender crisp. Portions are huge so take-home containers are pretty routine. The menu is broad and suitable for most tastes.

The poor review though is based on the fact that while I was paying for my items the salesperson started spraying a strong smelling cleaner on the counter right beside my items.  I asked her to keep it away and moved my items aside but she continued.  I should have stopped right there and returned the unprotected perches and toys.  Now I have them home and they do have a distinct smell.  I don't know what this product was but anyone who knows anything about birds knows that they are extremely vulnerable to toxins, inhaled or ingested. So I guess I'll be back tomorrow to return the 2 I didn't detag and I guess I'm out of luck on the other one and the two non returnable toys.  Pretty dumb move for a pet store.",

In early December I noticed an event dedicated to getting your pets photo taken with Santa.  Excited for this day I ordered a special holiday sweater for my cat and rallied up 2 other friends with pets. On the day of we arrived with pets dressed in holiday ware only to learn that the event was cancelled that day because they couldn't find a Santa Claus costume. My latest negative experience is where I draw the line. The particular cat food Coco eats is always out of stock. I came in twice in one week only to find the shelf empty. The manager placed an order for me and promised me it would arrive on Thursday. I came on Saturday to see that empty shelf but surprisingly a case was behind the cashiers desk. When I inquired about the case I was told it was reserved for somebody else. I was told this by the same person (a manager) who assured me I would have the special ordered cat food waiting for me. It didn't make any sense why someone else was getting special treatment over Coco and I. It made me feel incredibly uncomfortable and unfairly treated. She had no suggestions or solutions to this issue. I don't think this location is properly trained and knowledgeable enough to run a successful business. Clearly the management needs to step it up first before this could happen. It's really sad that animals suffer the most because of this.",

They pre-order the crab once you confirm your reservation and show you the crab before bringing it into the kitchen to cook (it was alive and flailing). The crab was perfectly cooked into 4 dishes. The legs and claws were steamed with garlic, the body fried with salt/pepper/shallot/garlic, seafood fried rice was baked into the shell, and residual meat/juice was used to poach some yuchoy. Everything was perfectly cooked and tasted fresh and delicious. Service was amazing too. You have to drive through some shady areas of Vancouver, but definitely work the trip. Highly recommend and would go back in a heartbeat.",

Expect the unexpected as you peruse through their intriguing selection. From out-of-this-world flavor combinations to random ingredients, Pelican dares to push the boundaries of culinary norms.\n\nAs we devoured each plate, we couldn't help but appreciate the boldness and creativity that went into the dishes. Pelican Restaurant is a playground for innovative flavors and unexpected pairings.\n\nSure, the decor might not be Insta-worthy, and the ambiance lacks pizzazz, but who needs that when the food is this extraordinary? Pelican is a haven for true food enthusiasts who are willing to step outside their comfort zones and embrace the weird and wonderful.\n\nSo, if you're a true gastronomic adventurer seeking a new experience of taste, make your way to Pelican Restaurant in East Hastings.

The fried black cod in Maggie sauce was a favourite as was the salted paper-wrapped roasted crispy chicken.  Pea shoots in superior broth with roasted garlic was also a good veggie dish.  The live seafood prices were fair and I enjoyed the fresh crab in green onion and ginger sauce which was very meaty.

After making me wait a while, they had their kitchen put my order together anew. I will give them kudos for managing to get me my food in 5-10 minutes, but this should've never been the case. When I opened up my order at home, the duck was already sliced up (which is great), but they definitely gave me only half the bird. I was already late for dinner, I called the restaurant after my family had our meal. The guy on the phone said they did indeed give me the whole duck, and the smaller serving is because ducks nowadays are smaller in size. He made sure to tell me that there were two legs and two wings, which I couldn't confirm, since I had called the restaurant after my family had already eaten the dish for dinner. However, as a Chinese person, I have grown up eating many a duck and I know what a whole vs half duck looks like. This barely filled the bottom of their round takeout container. I know that with Peking Duck orders, restaurants will often take part of the duck meat to make lettuce wraps to be served alongside sliced pieces, but this is not what I had ordered, nor did I get any bonus lettuce wraps - my order was one WHOLE duck. If they did give me two wings and legs, my best guess is that they kept the bulk of the duck to make lettuce wraps for some other customer. On top of that, the restaurant claims to give you 15% off for takeout orders, which was also a lie.\n\nSave your money and go somewhere else. Don't get ripped off by this dishonest business.\n\nOr at least be prepared to be charged $45 for a whole quail-sized duck.",

Great trial and error though. Try at your own risk.",

It looks great and tastes great as well.

We have not encountered any issues regarding its proximity to the road, and the safety and comfort of our guests are our top priorities.\n\nRegarding the plastic wrap found in your tuna dish, we take full responsibility for the oversight on our part, and we deeply apologize for any discomfort caused. Furthermore, we would like to clarify that the plastic wrap was not dirty but rather the protective wrap we use to wrap the tuna before cutting it. However, we understand that it should not have been present in the final dish, and we removed it from your bill upon notification.\n\nThe immediate action taken by our server reflects our commitment to addressing any issues promptly. We regret if her response left you with the impression that food safety was not taken seriously. Rest assured, we continuously train our staff to uphold the highest standards of food safety, and incidents like this are not common in our restaurant.\n\nRegarding the oysters, we typically offer smaller-sized oysters as they are favored by many of our regular patrons. However, we also have a premium option available, and the size of the oysters can vary depending on our supplier.\n\nLastly, the seafood towel you ordered was advertised as a towel for two people to share, and we understand that it may not have seemed enough to share between the three of you.\n\nThank you for acknowledging the good taste and drinks at our restaurant. We strive to maintain the quality of our offerings while continuously improving our food quality and safety measures to provide an exceptional dining experience.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback, and we will use it to make the necessary improvements.",

My wife had the special, pan fried Halibut in a roasted red pepper sauce which was delicious, perfectly prepared.

However we felt quite rushed at the end by another staff who might have been our hostess when we first walked in.

I've been coming here for a few years now for my seafood, and could never go anywhere else - it is always super fresh, and super delicious. Their organic spring salmon is some of the best I've ever had (highly recommend), and their smoked salmon selection is fantastic. I always go for the peppered nuggets (super moist and flavourful), the double smoked, and the cold smoked spring - they're the only people I've seen who cold smoke spring salmon! The service is always wonderful and they often go above and beyond. It's a bit pricey, however it's expected for the quality and location. I have and will continue recommending this place!",

Very fresh & high quality fish is supposed to be scent less & not fishy. I wonder if it's because not too many people were buying the spring salmon fillets & they were there for a while.

Every time we go to Vancouver we make sure we stop by the Rodney oyster's house in Yaletown.\nFrom fresh oysters to one of the best service I've had in a restaurant, this is definitely a place you need to try.\nEvery single plate was perfect and came super fast, we got the crab cakes, garlic shrimps, shrimp cocktail, clams, mussels and obviously oysters. Everything was so fresh and the oysters come with a lot of different choices of sauces for you to choose from.\nVery clean restaurant and very cute ambiance for a date, a dinner with friends or even to just go by yourself !\nThe staff working there has one of the best service I've seen in years, they are really on point and so friendly and nice, this is one of the reasons we always go back there, we just love the ambiance and service so much, a lot of place should take exemple of this place !\nWe've been served by Mackenzie and sadly I don't forget the name of the other employees that took care of us but it isn't the last time they will see us in the establishment!\nIF YOU LOVE SEAFOOD AND GOOD VIBES YOU NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE !",

Everything was so fresh and the oysters come with a lot of different choices of sauces for you to choose from.\nVery clean restaurant and very cute ambiance for a date, a dinner with friends or even to just go by yourself !\nThe staff working there has one of the best service I've seen in years, they are really on point and so friendly and nice, this is one of the reasons we always go back there, we just love the ambiance and service so much, a lot of place should take exemple of this place !\nWe've been served by Mackenzie and sadly I don't forget the name of the other employees that took care of us but it isn't the last time they will see us in the establishment!\nIF YOU LOVE SEAFOOD AND GOOD VIBES YOU NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE !",

We dove right in, so if you see the picture I took you can tell that a lot of the oysters had already been eaten by the time I got my camera out.\n\nYou know, you go away from raw oysters for a while and you start thinking, \"I'm kind of ok without them,\" or \"Did I really eat those things?\" But then you get taken to Rodney's and you relearn that oysters are amazing things to eat.",

Didn't wait long for a table for 2. Pleasantly surprised at the preset 2x combo meats + main + soup + 2 bowls of white rice for $56. So we ordered BBQ duck + pork, main was green beans w minced pork & soup of the day.\n\nThe MEH: menu should have spelled out that the combo soup is the soup of the day; no choosing. We asked for hot n sour, but the server brought the daily soup instead. When asked why, she then said the combo soup has to be daily soup.\n\nI found the BBQ pork and duck very tasty and not too oily. The green beans w minced pork were perfectly crispy but not too deep-fried. Again, very tasty. Didn't care for the daily soup, as it's just a thin broth w few veggies + few pieces of meat. Would have preferred the hot n sour \n\nFinal bill w tax was just under $60.",

The little mini mall has a busy parking lot but you can usually find street parking (both free and paid).\n\nWe've been here a few times to grab a quick bbq lunch combo. But we finally visited for dine-in recently. In addition to their bbq service, they have a full Chinese seafood menu offering.\n\nWe ordered the 3 item bbq combo (you pick and choose which bbq items you want but we opted for the roast pork, bbq, and soya sauce chicken). While the bbq price is higher than the lunch combos, you get more meat. Not a bad price when you consider how much the price of bbq duck has gone up lately. The duck was good... meaty and juicy. Roast pork has nice crispy skin. A welcome addition to the area for bbq.\n\nPea tips were good too. And I like that we received complimentary soup to start and green bean soup for dessert.\n\nReally want to come back here and try some of their seafood combos.\n\nUpdate: We did return in October to try a dinner combo with a 2lb lobster sticky rice with 2 bbq items plus 1 other dish for $118 (we picked the sole fillets with veggies). We also added the Taiwanese cauliflower with lap cheung and bacon. Again, you get complimentary soup and dessert. Bbq items were as good as before.",

The lobster roll held it's own but the new kettle chips are a miss.   Bring back Ms Vickies!  The kettle chips were hard and tasteless.",

Aquarium equipment and supplies. A Great selection of water plants.\nThey also sell rodents, guinea pigs and chinchillas too!\n\nPretty much bought everything for our tank from this store over the past 15 years. Except our actual tank which was from the 80s.\n\nJust a heads up side note;\n\nIt can be a little uptight with the on-going covid restrictions and how you enter and leave the store can be a bit uncomfortable and off-putting.\n\nYou have to leave your backpack behind the counter and wait behind a rope before being allowed entry.\nThis is understandable in our city of Vancouver where shoplifting & addiction is rampant unfortunately. This store is way too nice to let any scumbags in. I get it.",

A Great selection of water plants.\nThey also sell rodents, guinea pigs and chinchillas too!\n\nPretty much bought everything for our tank from this store over the past 15 years. Except our actual tank which was from the 80s.\n\nJust a heads up side note;\n\nIt can be a little uptight with the on-going covid restrictions and how you enter and leave the store can be a bit uncomfortable and off-putting.\n\nYou have to leave your backpack behind the counter and wait behind a rope before being allowed entry.\nThis is understandable in our city of Vancouver where shoplifting & addiction is rampant unfortunately. This store is way too nice to let any scumbags in. I get it.",

They only do Cash which is very very annoying as you have to run bring cash and come back, they don't speak a single word in English so it's very very hard to communicate with them we had to translate through Google and show them what we needed at some point.  The lady that works here is very sweet, and she tries, but the males are very rude, and they yell a lot. My friend went to bring cash before we knew the total price so we were short of 50$ and said we will go bring more hold on but the guy started screaming in Chinese and just dropped some of the stuff we brought back to the tanks and kept only the food we had the cash for at the moment (our order was 200$, for this amount i expect a better treatment at least! Plus, we were about to go bring more cash!!) But they didn't understand us. We didn't understand them it's just a mess! I was annoyed that i couldn't get the rest of the stuff i wanted, and after that , I was not willing to go bring more money and spend it here! Also, if a Chinese customer comes even after you, they get to pass you and pay first even if you're standing there first, so just expect that.",

We went straight from the train station to the restaurant and had the best meal of our trip so far. The crab baguette was fantastic. Crusty yet soft baguette with an explosion of flavors. The fennel slaw added an amazing crunch and flavor. We also had the salmonito wrap. Fresh and fantastic - the salmon was cut right then and there to make our wrap. The fries were excellent too and we dipped them in the housemade tartar sauce. The staff was incredible and made sure we were happy with our food. I don't often leave reviews but this was too good not to note. Take the time to visit this slightly out of the way spot. You won't be disappointed. I'm hoping my first visit to Vancouver won't be my last because I'll be dreaming of this food for awhile.",

To say it was superb would be an understatement. The perfectly fried Arctic Char exceeded all my expectations. It was succulent and full of flavour, pairing harmoniously with the crispy chips. This dish struck a perfect balance between the delicate fish and the satisfyingly crunchy chips. Its like a perfect balance between trout and salmon in taste.\n\nThis was, without a doubt, the best Arctic Char Fish and Chips I have ever had in Canada. Their tartar sauce is also to die for they now sell it in mason jars great choice.\n\nRating: 5/5 Stars",

To say it was superb would be an understatement. The perfectly fried Arctic Char exceeded all my expectations. It was succulent and full of flavour, pairing harmoniously with the crispy chips. This dish struck a perfect balance between the delicate fish and the satisfyingly crunchy chips. Its like a perfect balance between trout and salmon in taste.\n\nThis was, without a doubt, the best Arctic Char Fish and Chips I have ever had in Canada. Their tartar sauce is also to die for they now sell it in mason jars great choice.\n\nRating: 5/5 Stars",

It is a bit loud when the places fills up but you can still hear your dinner companions.\nHowever they do have a great wine and beer menu for those who do partake.\nThe restaurant was clean and well staffed.

We were looking for sashimi grade fish, particularly Hamachi.  They don't have it at the time, but they introduced Shima Aji, which was pretty close to what we were looking for, and we were glad to follow their recommendation.  We also purchased  Bluefin tuna, and of course the toro was very fresh.  We were very happy with the quality of sashimi grade fish we got there, and will definitely visit the place again the next time we go to Vancouver.  Thank you Seafood City.",

Every employee there is really knowledgeable about aquarium care. Although I wasn't there to buy fish, the principles are all pretty much the same for my turtle, and I was able to get all the necessary decorations, chemicals, and materials to make the perfect home for my turtle.\n\nI also ordered my aquarium stand from them at a great price compared to other stores, and they hand-delivered it to me within the week! I felt particularly grateful for that, because I did not have the strength to carry that item myself, and I was already a bit stressed about that. They took the worry right out of my hands. Not to mention...it was free!\n\nI also had one of the employees teach me about improving the flora in my aquarium, and advised me on some good decorations that would not just be pretty, but support the health of the tank. Since I've done the recommendations, my tank is healthier than it has ever been, and it requires less maintenance compared to before. Every time I go into the store I learn a bunch of new things!\n\nI always enjoy going to April's Aquarium. Not just because it's fun to look at the fishes and browse the goods, but because the service is truly top notch. I highly recommend it for all your aquarium needs! Thank you!",

It was after work, so I was lucky enough to catch Calvin the owner unloading a van full of Spot Prawns that were massive and still kicking.\n\nWe did he prawns sashimi style and a quick boil.

I love it as it serves great lobster rolls without much fanfare and sitting outdoors in a casual environment is such an enjoyment.\n\nWe visited the live seafood next door where we were keen to try the sea urchins. However, they don't cut the sea urchins for you so I decided it was too much hassle to cut it myself. It didn't look as delicious as ones I had in Hokkaido so am ok to give it a pass.\n\nDon't miss out on the lobster rolls though.",

Freshness: Live seafood is the epitome of freshness. When you order live lobster, crab, or oysters, you can be confident that you're getting seafood at its peak quality and flavor.\n\n2. Flavor: Live seafood tends to have a more delicate and succulent flavor compared to seafood that has been frozen or stored for an extended period. The natural sweetness of these creatures is best preserved when they are alive until just before cooking.\n\n3. Texture: The texture of live lobster and crab is exceptional. When cooked properly, the meat is tender, juicy, and full of natural juices, making it a delightful dining experience. Oysters, on the other hand, are prized for their unique texture and briny, oceanic taste.\n\n4. Interactive Dining: There's an interactive aspect to dining on live seafood. Preparing and cracking open a lobster or crab can be a fun and engaging experience, perfect for social gatherings and special occasions.\n\nIt's really fun dining experience here in lobster man.\n\nEspecially thank staff Sean.\nHe provided exceptional service. He was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable.\nSean went above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was enjoyable.\nWe appreciated his recommendations and the way he made us feel well taken care of throughout the meal.

Crab Cakes,Truffle Spot Prawn Mac n Cheese)\n\nTo celebrate the launch of their fall seasonal menu, Fresh Ideas Start Here was offering a small bowl of complimentary seafood congee to the first 50 customers who came into their store and mentioned the word \"halibut.\" We'd never tried this seafood congee before, but apparently it's a \"cult favourite\" so we went to the store right when it opened and managed to bring home some of this famed seafood congee.\n\nOh wow! This seafood congee exceeded my expectations. I totally understand now why it's a cult favourite. It was packed with seafood. They don't skimp on ingredients at this place. According to the stickers stuck onto our containers, a small congee is normally $6 and a large congee is normally $8. I would absolutely go back and pay to have this seafood congee again! I'm so happy that it's Fall now. With hot summer days leaving, and cooler weather arriving, we should definitely have a reason to go back for the seafood congee!\n\nService: Good\nParking: Plentiful and free\nLocation: 7515 Market Crossing #180, Burnaby",
