I signed up for a trial pass after a few months off from my cancellation at another gym. When I came in, a younger male was helping me to activate the trial. I had received a text message saying the 7 day pass was no longer offered but a one day was available to claim. I decided to pass on the trial I booked in for and perhaps go another time. A few days later I got a text message offering a 7 day trial so my assumption that they were offering it to me since I wasn't coming in. The younger male at the front kept going back and forth and reading and explaining the text messages to me, not even doing anything to resolve or find a solution. Honestly, if he is looking to be a position of management in the future, making sure your guests are happy and feel taken cared for is the number one thing. The gym is a personal and intimate space and I was not happy with someone like that handling my account. He kept going back and forth and I literally said to him \"honestly this is not my problem, what can we do about it\". I told him either way a 1 day or a 7 day I'll take since I was already there. If it wasn't for Von I wouldn't even consider going to this location. Focus on learning conflict resolution instead of focusing on the problem and repeating it to the client thinking that it is the answer and will resolve it lol. Don't really need a male younger than me speaking to me like that but I'm patient enough to give people space to grow and learn, literally not my responsibility. The location is clean and quiet, I went around 2-3pm. They have a bag for Muay Thai\n\n\"I see we need to update our messaging system, I will check if we can honour the seven days but in the case we can't, is the one day trial for today okay with you?\"",

It's great they have a women's only section that is well equipped.\nHowever the way they get you to join is by pressuring you with deals. They advertise a '3 day free trial' but that's not really true, since you have to have a whole meeting about the gym and prices before you can try it, and then they'll hound you with deals you can only have if you join before working out. I wanted to actually try the gym before committing, but felt really pressured by this meeting (with Farah) and left with a bad taste in my mouth.\nI signed up for 3 months to see if it was worth the price (around $72 per month). It's a good gym with lots of equipment and always pretty clean. It's never crazy busy either and other people here are friendly and just focused on their workout. The classes system is confusing as you have to pay extra for some of them and the booking on my app never worked, so I didn't try the classes.\n\nThey don't seem to pay much attention to the bathrooms as the women's was frequently out of toilet paper.\n\nTheir customer service is only contactable by email and they take over a week to reply, or just don't reply. This is really annoying when you want to freeze your membership or do other things that the front desk can't do.\n\nOverall, I like this gym but they need to change the way they recruit new members. If it was a fixed price a month without all the fees and commitments I would probably stay. But the hassle and pressure isn't worth it for me, I'd rather go to a gym where it's the same price every month and they're not just trying to get your money.",

I just want to share my experience that can save others a hassle and potential harassment. Being a nurse and also a business owner, I didn't think I would go through a major downfall. Life happened where I lost my house and had to move in with relatives while I went through counselling and getting back on my feet now 2.5years later. These guys sent me to collections for over $600.00 not because of gym time I used but because OF A CONTRACT. Even knowing the circumstance I was in. With that being said, started then harassment phone calls, once again because of a CONTRACT. We are in an era where please try to refrain from any signage of contracts as possible. Then this year they sent another total to collections for an account that did not exist trying to collect extra money. Thank God I still kept the email of confirmation from 2.5 years ago. When I called, I knew I also needed email proof so they don't lie. Instead of an apology of trying to extort more money and sending it to collections, the women recanted and said she didn't have proof in writing but I sent the previous email for account closure and final receipt from the years prior. These idiots have caused so much time wastage and stress. To make time to even do this review, I'm at work on my break.  I could of course not afford a lawyer than whereas I can now and would of fought this just for the purpose of humanity. I have a membership with Club 16/She's Fit, Club Pilates and a personal trainer now. They are not like this. Transparency is key and this company really will Destry you when there is a bigger picture in life. DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THEM. THEY HAVE NOT CHANGED ANYTHING. Anyhow if you go through something in life, the customer service you will received from this company is beyond disgusting. There are many companies with policies in place like ones I work for and I own where we consider cancellation of services and deposit based on individual need. I will be posting more on my blogs in the upcoming months in regards to contracts. Also when approaching them, assure you have it in email - which is what I did to assure they didn't falsely take more money.",

The management team there has consistently displayed a lack of customer service skills, bordering on rudeness. During all my workouts, I was abruptly told not to drop the weights, a message that could have been conveyed in a much more polite and professional manner.\n\nBut what truly pushed me over the edge was the handling of my membership cancellation. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, I called to cancel my membership and was under the impression that it had been taken care of. Imagine my surprise when I just recently found out my membership was still active, and I had been billed all this time. When I called to rectify the situation, I was met with vague responses and no straightforward answers.\n\nI've since signed up with West Coast Iron, a nearby gym, and the difference in customer service and gym quality is night and day. Gold's Gym in Port Coquitlam has been by far the worst gym experience I've ever had, and I strongly urge anyone considering a membership to think twice.",

I was greeted by friendly staff who were genuinely interested in helping me achieve my fitness goals. They took the time to understand my needs and provided valuable advice without pushing me into any unnecessary commitments. It was evident that they genuinely cared about creating a positive and inclusive environment for all members. The equipment at this gym is also really good, with a ton of options. The cleanliness of the gym was commendable too, and I appreciated the staff's efforts in maintaining a hygienic space. One incident that really stood out to me was when I encountered a small issue with one of the machines. I approached a staff member and they walked with me to the machine right away and then told the maintenance team. I think what sets this gym apart from other places I've been is really the positive and motivating atmosphere. The members here are friendly and supportive, creating a sense of community that is often lacking in other gyms. The trainers are approachable and always willing to offer guidance, making sure that you get the most out of your workout routine. To sum it up, despite the negative feedback, my personal experience has been nothing but positive. I encourage anyone who might have been skeptical like I was to give it a chance. You might just be pleasantly surprised, just like I was! Overall, I highly recommend Fitness World Kingsway to anyone looking for a gym that offers quality equipment, helpful staff, and a welcoming atmosphere.",

I was greeted by friendly staff who were genuinely interested in helping me achieve my fitness goals. They took the time to understand my needs and provided valuable advice without pushing me into any unnecessary commitments. It was evident that they genuinely cared about creating a positive and inclusive environment for all members. The equipment at this gym is also really good, with a ton of options. The cleanliness of the gym was commendable too, and I appreciated the staff's efforts in maintaining a hygienic space. One incident that really stood out to me was when I encountered a small issue with one of the machines. I approached a staff member and they walked with me to the machine right away and then told the maintenance team. I think what sets this gym apart from other places I've been is really the positive and motivating atmosphere. The members here are friendly and supportive, creating a sense of community that is often lacking in other gyms. The trainers are approachable and always willing to offer guidance, making sure that you get the most out of your workout routine. To sum it up, despite the negative feedback, my personal experience has been nothing but positive. I encourage anyone who might have been skeptical like I was to give it a chance. You might just be pleasantly surprised, just like I was! Overall, I highly recommend Fitness World Kingsway to anyone looking for a gym that offers quality equipment, helpful staff, and a welcoming atmosphere.",

They didn't call me and I WAS CHARGED even though I was unable to practice any physical activity. I called them to inform about what was agreed (what the employee had told me), they said that no one would call me. It is not the client's fault the training structure they offer to their employees.I didn't receive any refund, even I saying that I could send them the doctor's note.\n\n2. Then, with a newborn at home, I requested the freeze again in a different period, and 2 days later, I WAS CHARGED. This is unacceptable. It is no the customer problem how is the financial dynamic of the company. We didn't receive the refund!\n\nFinally, we requested to cancel the membership and also because we moved to Calgary. The staff member said that they need 30 days notice - what wasn't informed to us when we signed up. We said that we wanted to cancel right away and we also requested our refund for what we were charged on the 2nd time. The lady said that she would cancel it but the refund could not be made.\n\nAt the end of the day, we basically paid the 30 days notice with the money that we should receive as a refund (for the 2nd inappropriate charge).\n\nWe feel extremely harmed by this company, we feel that we were charged inappropriately.

It's the only GoodLife near me and after reading all the reviews saying not to come between 5-10, I decided to try it out at 10:15pm on a Monday night. It. Was. Packed. The equipment is fine and exactly the same as any other GoodLife, but you won't get to use it. The space is waaay too small for the population it's trying to serve. I also didn't like how the whole place shakes whenever someone drops their weights (due to being on the second floor), which is constantly. I can't see how working out here after work is even possible and I have cancelled my GoodLife membership as a result.

I've heard golds gym ages ago also had an amazing tour in LA's where the staffs are also super friendly.Since i have membership with good life i didn't know the golds gym is also running business in Canada. So recently I've booked a free one day pass and really looking forward.After 1hr drive from where i live to UBC golds gym( they have four locations, UBC,west broadway. Langley and another i couldn't remember). I planned to go for a run after work out so i chose ubc one. Ok direct to the point now. I was told unfortunately I'm not allowed to work out here cuz i don't live near by within 10km or you can become the membership with us then i asked them to prove that regulation cuz i wouldn't even come if i saw this information. Then they showed me a sentence on the website says must be local resident. Please tell me how to define LOCAL. No matter which location i chose will be out of 10km. At the end i was told either pay 15 bucks or leave. Really don't wanna ruined my day so i paid. Booked a one day free pass turns out been charged. Hilarious. Besides that. All the equipments are super old. Oldies but not goodies.",

I've heard golds gym ages ago also had an amazing tour in LA's where the staffs are also super friendly.Since i have membership with good life i didn't know the golds gym is also running business in Canada. So recently I've booked a free one day pass and really looking forward.After 1hr drive from where i live to UBC golds gym( they have four locations, UBC,west broadway. Langley and another i couldn't remember). I planned to go for a run after work out so i chose ubc one. Ok direct to the point now. I was told unfortunately I'm not allowed to work out here cuz i don't live near by within 10km or you can become the membership with us then i asked them to prove that regulation cuz i wouldn't even come if i saw this information. Then they showed me a sentence on the website says must be local resident. Please tell me how to define LOCAL. No matter which location i chose will be out of 10km. At the end i was told either pay 15 bucks or leave. Really don't wanna ruined my day so i paid. Booked a one day free pass turns out been charged. Hilarious. Besides that. All the equipments are super old. Oldies but not goodies.",

But it's the placement of equipment paired with the shortage of equipment to match the volume of customers. This is a busy gym, and they waste so much space. 1/3 of the gym is filled with cardio equipment which is barely used. A very small free weight section. A large personal trainer section which is barely utilized, with a lot of that equipment being desperately needed by all the people going. The personal training area has too many squat racks, with not enough for everyone else. There is a large transition area towards a female only area. The transition has a few pieces of equipment for stretching and that's about it. It could have been used for more free weight area, which again is very needed. Would not recommend this gym in its current state. There are better GoodLife's.",

The hot yoga classes are always full, the gym equipment in the women's area has been broken for a long time. Specifically the cardio machines. They either don't adjust with the buttons, are in very poor shape, or they simply just shut off randomly. I've worked out in the co-ed side at night and have been harassed by other men who exercise there. Now the women's area is the only place I feel comfortable exercising in and even that area is below expectations. The steam room is always off. Towels everywhere, just overall unkept.\n\nThey also just got rid of the tanning beds completely. Prior to this their tanning was limited to every 24hours, in which they changed it to 48hrs, then just completely removed the service as a whole. I'm not sure what my membership even entitles anymore. It's not worth the price to exercise here unless the 24hour option is convenient for you. I was quoted less of a biweekly rate at Club Fitness right next door at Lougheed Mall which has way better equipment AND 24hr/tanning + classes with no contract commitments. Please do better as a gym to serve your existing clients as the condition of this gym is extremely dissatisfactory for the rates you are making members pay.",

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the intermittent closures earlier this year. We acknowledge that there were maintenance challenges that affected the availability of the hot tub during the months you mentioned.\n\nFirstly, one of the pipes that was essential for the functioning of the hot tub broke down unexpectedly. We ordered the new parts right away but because of the supply chain issues it took longer than expected. Further, there were chemical imbalances and a sudden visit by Fraser health led us to closing it. We have taken measures to rectify the situation and are pleased to inform you that the hot tub has been fully operational for a considerable period now, without any reported issues. Also, we drain the water every Thursday to fill it back in and that has helped us a whole lot in preventing these unforeseen occurrences.\n\nAs for the club runs, we value your feedback and will definitely be talking to the staff to better utilize their time and are more attentive to the member needs. \n\nWhile we are unable to offer a discount on your membership, as our membership agreements and pricing structure are standardized for all members, we are committed to providing you with an improved experience moving forward.

Your feedback is  important, and I want to express my sincerest apologies for the frustration and inconvenience you've endured as a result of your interactions with our team.\n\nI completely understand your concern about the membership and personal training packages you were pushed into purchasing, especially considering the subsequent challenges with cancellation and associated charges. It's disheartening to know that our handling of your situation fell short of your expectations, causing you distress and a reluctance to consider gym contracts in the future.\n\nNormally, if you are moving 30km away from the gym and provide a copy of one of the acceptable proof of move, it should have been a seamless process. Regardless, I apologize for any confusion or lack of clarity in our cancellation policies at that time. We are committed to improving our policies to ensure they're transparent and member-friendly to prevent such instances in the future.\n\nI deeply regret any negative experiences you had with our previous gym manager, Jean. Rest assured, we take your concerns seriously and will look into this matter further to enhance our management interactions and overall customer service.\n\nOn a positive note, I'm glad to hear that your personal trainer, Michelle, made a positive impact during your time at our gym. Our trainers are dedicated to helping members like you achieve their fitness goals, and it's heartening to know that Michelle played a valuable role in your fitness journey.\n\nIf there's anything more you'd like to share or if you have specific suggestions on how we can improve our services, I'm here to listen. Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we're committed to using it to make meaningful changes to provide a better experience for all our members.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
