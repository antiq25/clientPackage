Had to go to washroom first as I have some health issues and needed to wash my hands before I eat. As normally ppl should. Staff didn't want to let me in with an excuse that the maintenance is in progress. No one was doing maintenance they just simply decided to close to the washroom for the night. This kind of behaviour should be illegal as it is a restaurant and restaurant bylaw says clearly you need to provide washroom when ppl eat in. Hope they will not behave like this towards anyone else in the future. Managers name that night was Jenny. Hope the top management will sort this out. I will visit again to see if the behaviour towards customers improved. Then will revisit my review.",

Go to the Kingsway/Victoria location if you can, it's a bit cheaper.\n\nOn top of being one of the most expensive locations in the city this one's also one of the worst.  They clear off all orders from their pick up screen making for a confused, full lobby of everyone asking if their order is up.  Use the system as it's meant to be and things would be a lot clearer and run more smoothly!\n\nSomehow, this location also has the worst McIced coffee ever.",

Go to the Kingsway/Victoria location if you can, it's a bit cheaper.\n\nOn top of being one of the most expensive locations in the city this one's also one of the worst.  They clear off all orders from their pick up screen making for a confused, full lobby of everyone asking if their order is up.  Use the system as it's meant to be and things would be a lot clearer and run more smoothly!\n\nSomehow, this location also has the worst McIced coffee ever.",

This is not a one-time deal; they're the nearest McDonald's and as a busy student on a budget I end up here once in a while. No matter what time of day, even if they aren't busy, you'll end up getting parked to wait for your food when going through drive thru, even for a small, basic order, and sometimes end up sitting for upwards of 10 minutes. \"Fast food\", woo! There's never any greeting at the drive thru mic, you drive up and sit there waiting for several minutes without so much as a \"hello\" or \"be right with you\". Today, I received two \"sausage\" egg McMuffins with no sausage on either. Great... to summarize: terrible, slow, inaccurate, impolite and no end in sight.

This is not a one-time deal; they're the nearest McDonald's and as a busy student on a budget I end up here once in a while. No matter what time of day, even if they aren't busy, you'll end up getting parked to wait for your food when going through drive thru, even for a small, basic order, and sometimes end up sitting for upwards of 10 minutes. \"Fast food\", woo! There's never any greeting at the drive thru mic, you drive up and sit there waiting for several minutes without so much as a \"hello\" or \"be right with you\". Today, I received two \"sausage\" egg McMuffins with no sausage on either. Great... to summarize: terrible, slow, inaccurate, impolite and no end in sight. Not to mention their nightmare of a parking lot.",

Here's a balanced review highlighting the key points:\n\nPositive:\nMenu Variety - McDonald's offers a diverse menu with plenty of options. Whether it was classic favourites or new additions, there were choices to suit different preferences and dietary restrictions.\n\nNegative:\nSlow Service - This particular McDonald's service could have been faster. It took longer than expected to place my order and receive my food. Improved efficiency during peak hours would enhance the overall dining experience.\n\nNegative:\nAtmosphere Concerns - The atmosphere of the restaurant fell short of expectations. The seating area appeared unclean, and the floors were scattered with food and drink spills. This lack of cleanliness created an unhealthy and uninviting environment.\n\nPositive:\nFamiliarity and Convenience - McDonald's consistency in its menu and service can be comforting for customers seeking a familiar dining experience. Additionally, its convenient locations make it easily accessible for a quick meal.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to McDonald's in Vancouver had ups and downs. While the menu variety and familiarity were positive, the slow service and cleanliness issues detracted from the overall experience. I hope the management takes note of these concerns and takes steps to improve service efficiency and maintain a cleaner and more inviting environment for customers.",

Asked to change the hot fries with no salt and complained I had been waiting for my food over 30 mins.  The manager gave an attitude, \"it is not my problem, we were busy\", I said \"so is that my problem? you are the manager on duty and not responsible the human power?\"  She turned around and shout \"it's not my problem, give her something hot\".  I am patience enough to wait more than 30 mins for FAST FOOD and I deserve to receive this kind of \"Customer service\"????  The manager was trying to hide when I was taking her picture for evidence.  And other manager on duty was trying to cover her and asked me am I using human right.  There is nothing to do with human right but I was not treated right.  I brought it up to McDonald Headquarter about the incident I experienced at this location and asked for refund coz I threw them away.  The headquarter told me this restaurant manager would contact me within 10 business days but I never receive any phone call or email.  I received 2 meal coupons from Headquarter as a refund.  I will never ever come back again.  P.S. This restaurant is always full of garbage everywhere and no one was doing cleaning.",

I can see if it were late at night or busy or understaffed but it was quiet, with at least four staff around 7pm. I don't expect much from fast food but when I'm paying $16 for 2 burgers, fries and a coke I expect it to at least be hot. And ketchup would have been nice considering I specifically asked for it. Worst McDonald's I've been to in a very long time.\n\n*Edit\nI have since returned to this McDonald's and have had a much better experience. Maybe that one visit was just an off day or maybe there was a change in management. Whatever the reason, I hate to pigeon hole a place based on 1 visit. I will eat here again as it's close to home, and let you all know how it goes. Upgrading from 1 to 3 stars.\n\nEdit* I ordered a cone which immediately fell apart all over my hands. She grabbed a cup and put it in there and thought that was sufficient. I asked for a new one. She disappeared for a minute anf gave me the same cone in a cup and said it was new. I'm done with this McDonald's. 0 stars",

And when you refuse to be parked you get even worse service because now you are going against the normal, it's a drive thru and I should have to pull over and wait. While I sat and waited for my order 6 to 7 vehicles were parked so they can make their time for drive thru.  Truly terrible management for thinking this is acceptable to treat customers like this.\n\nAfter receiving my order my fry level is laughable. Ordered junior McChicken extra mayo and received my mcchicken with no mayo\n\nHow do you mess that up.\nCompletely unacceptable.\n\nCorporate McDonald's needs to review this location and it's management for customer service and drive thru operations.",

I went inside and stood at the counter and waited for my order. There's no lineu, there's only one order on the order screen, which was mine. There's nobody at the till, there's a couple cooks in the back mopping and a lady up front mopping. After a few minutes the lady up front sees me and then tells the cooks that there's an order up. The cooks say something I couldn't understandand and disappear around the corner. I assume that they're going to finish baking my cookies. Fresh baked cookies, yay, I mean why else would I be waiting around this long for six cookies? They were in the oven baking. No doubt.\n\nBut they weren't. They weren't in the oven baking. After about 7 or 8 minutes another young lady comes out from, I guess the break room, and asked if I've been helped. I'm like \"yeah I placed an order a while ago.\" She looks at the till and then reaches under the counter and grabs me six cookies and hands them to me. And, oh yeah, they weren't chocolate cookies either, they ran out. They were the chocolate chip ones. So I wait around for almost 10 minutes for six cookies, and they weren't even the right ones. The complacency at this McDonald's was unreal. I have to laugh honestly it was so bad it was comical. The girl who came in at the end who actually got me the cookies I will say, was doing her job correctly as far as I can tell..\n\nI decided to get cookies here because I was picking up an Uber eats order. Except they told me I had to cancel the order because the customer ordered things from the evening menu and it was now on the breakfast menu. So I had to text the customer and let them know I can't pick up her order because they can't make it and I'll have to cancel. And I canceled. My question is why does this McDonald's have items on their Uber menu that customers can't order? Every McDonald's I've ordered from will have either breakfast items on the menu or their lunch and evening items on the menu. Fix your Uber menu. This is crazy to me also how someone can be on break and literally know other employee in the restaurant looks at orders or prepares orders. Like don't you have a protocol for like, you know, knowing when orders come in? And getting the customers their food?",

I went up to the counter to ask how long as people who ordered after me were getting their meals and let's be real 18 minutes for two items at McDonald's is beyond ridiculous. Was ignored by several employees. Finally got the attention of one of them and was treated poorly as if I was lying. 20+ minutes for two items is ridiculous. The food was awful, no lettuce, super soggy. This place needs new management immediately as it clearly shows the staff they have now were not trained properly and cannot handle the work load (wasn't busy at all). You go to McDonald's and don't really expect top notch service etc but this was baffling.",

Of course there are individuals, I know someone who got ripped off by an individual in this Burger King. There are also regular working people, office people, young people, and tourists. Usually they always have posters up for items that sold out long ago. They have a really large menu with a lot of customizability. I always found the staff to be nice and patient with me, even though I have yet to memorize the Burger King menu, and always need to read it when I get to the front. When you're standing at the front waiting for your food, it feels really tense, like a contest, because some things take forever, and you could get your food way earlier or way later than you expect.\n\nNot just anybody can use the bathrooms, they would be too prone to abuse in a location like this, the bathrooms are for paying customers only. No shenanigans.\n\nI like the music they play in here, it's always pleasant. Generally '70s music with a leaning towards soul.\n\nThe Angry Whopper is dope, I like that, I get it with no cheese because I'm lactose intolerant. I want to try and see if they have any spicy chicken tenders or nuggets.\n\nThis is a lively and fun establishment.\n\nTo be honest, I like to go to Jollibee first and order a two piece chicken, eat that, and then smuggle the Jollibee gravy in my pocket and use it for the Burger King fries. I haven't gotten banned yet.\n\nI usually go during off hours in the afternoons, and there are a lot of individuals. Right now I'm here at lunch and it is very orderly and normal.

Everyone was working hard even the cashier looked drained. orders were coming out quickly, staff were friendly and helpful and someone was out in the dining room keeping things clean (I really appreciated that). Of course my order took longer then most because I had to get something that took time to do but no complaints from me.

Service is efficient and quick but I took off a star because they replaced my dipping sauce with another one without telling me because they were out of the one I ordered. I would have appreciated that they asked me with which one to replace. Also I took off another star for the size of the fries that is ridiculously small. Seriously bk, even the small size of McDo is bigger than your medium size!!",

I got my regular order which is a two breakfast burrito meal with coffee, a sausage McMuffin, and I decided to add a smoothie.  I got my order, opened the bag and right away there was no smoothie.  I take out the food and proceed to open up my burritos to add salsa inside.  Right away I noticed that the wrap seems soggy, I open it and the eggs and meat inside look wet.  I take a bite and it tastes fine.  Then I take my first sip of coffee and that tastes off.  I'm hungry so I eat my food.....  Then in around a half hour I start to feel light headed and sick to my stomach.  Then 15-20 minutes later I find myself puking and sitting on the toilet for a while.  It's now 8 hours later and my stomach has still been a mess.  No idea what happened, I've had this same breakfast so many times and it's never done this to me, so I guess I'm posting this to say if it looks or tastes off don't eat the food.",

For sure the restaurant part is closed. The inside is dimly lit.

A person was actually playing on her phone standing in front of the coffee station. So I guess there was one guy assigned to make the coffee and he was off doing something and needing to get scissors and going back but NO ONE even thought of trying to speed things along by making the coffee. They didn't look like trainees because no one was learning anything. There was a manager on site too! Plus other people in the back and a person sweeping up out front, and yet, no sign of a thought that they could help while there were only a couple of people waiting. Normally it's quite slow to get an order there later in the day but I always figured it was because they were overwhelmed with people and you can see many customers standing around (and at least they are trying and working hard), but in this case, they were not busy. So since no one had started to get the coffee yet, I asked politely if I could get the coffee in my own travel mug please. She answered yes, but with a derisive expression and tone but then didn't take the cup. So found out she was going to pour it in from their disposable cup after and that they don't charge for the cup there (which doesn't matter to me). The other McDonald's I go to has already put up a corporate sign encouraging using your own cup, so I know that while there is a Covid concern, as a company they have already made this change and McDonald's has produced this sign at least a month ago. Anyhow, I said that pouring it in defeats the purpose of trying to reduce waste, so she did bring it over to the area but did not explain it to the ONE GUY that apparently can pour coffee in the place and they still wasted a cup and to really rub it in, he opened up a straw in front of me to stir with completely unnecessarily when they knew I was concerned with waste because I had that conversation with that other woman and she completely couldn't be bothered to pass it on or look after the fact that I had made the request to use my cup directly (no one else was waiting in line). Also, when I told him not to (when I saw him open up the straw package), he continued moving to put it in the coffee even though I was CLEARLY saying no and then I had to really emphasize it, because he just wouldn't stop! SUCH AN UNPLEASANT experience. I am flabbergasted by the lack of any motivation to be competent by this crew. I understand division of labour but this was a huge failure. The other McDonald's that is encouraging travel mugs also gets the entire order done before I even get over to the counter and is friendly and normal, not rude and full of attitude on arrival. At the very least, try to be friendly when you greet someone, especially when they are friendly and happy in the first place, and especially when it was not busy at all! Submitted in the spirit of trying to help because if no one ever said anything, this place would keep having problems.",

Drive thru and in-restaurant ordering experiences were always positive.\n\nParking is plenty, but due to the elongated space, you're a little further away a lot of times.\n\nFood-wise, due to traffic volume, is more often fresh than not.

If ONE person has bad service it can spread, possibly this someone who has been there a long time with seniority? I do believe it can trickle down. Well if he's being lazy then I'm being lazy.

The late night staff seems to always have some sort of argument as to why they can't serve me the food I ordered. Today I ordered something as simple as a large ice water and the guy told me that I was unable to order that I told him I was willing to pay for it and he said sorry I don't want to do it. This makes no sense to me I've never been to a restaurant where you're willing to pay for a product and they say no to you especially if it's just WATER. Especially when you're spending 30 to $40 each time just for two people you would expect better service. I hope management gets involved in actually makes a difference and teaches these people customer service it seems that customer service has gone down the drain. The employees act annoyed to serve you. It's super sad. I miss the good old days of good customer service. Not a Karen just want basic customer service.",

Due to the heavy weight, the tray broke in half and the 4 coffees spilled on the ground. The young lady asked the manager if she could get a replacement and have someone to clean up the floor. However....the manager said back to her \"can you get the mop from the washroom and clean it up yourself?\" The young lady was stunned and overwhelmed that the manager actually told her to go clean up the mess. The manager continues to say that \"in here, whoever makes the mess gotta clean up themselves.\" The young lady was also shocked and said \" excuse me, but what?\" Seeing the customer unsatisfied, the manager said \"okay, you can clean it up and I will tell someone (a worker) to help you.\"  This left me speech, I have never seen customer service like this anywhere else.

Many people don't and therefore the toilet is disgusting, reminiscent of what we see in third world countries.  The door to the toilet also needs to be pulled open on the way out. They have no paper dispenser. Therefore the staff are probably picking up a collection of germs and bringing it to the kitchen.  I politely brought this to attention of the manager named Cameron B.  He was abrupt, dismissive and rash to the point of being discourteous. I'm at least double his age.  He kept repeating over my concerns: \"This has nothing to do with us\".  There are $20 foot pulls that they can install to allow customers and staff to open the door without touching the handles.",

When my son talked to the staff asking him to top up the large cup, he grabbed the two smoothies (one large and one medium size), and pour the smoothie out from the medium cup to the large cup to top up the large smoothie! What kind of attitude is that? We are not beggar who ask for free food but have paid full price for what we are entitled to receive from the merchant! When the staff passed the \"adjusted\" smoothies back to us, the female staff who was standing next to the Asian young staff who was dealing with our request looked surprised by what the Asian staff had done to the cups. This is a terrible customer service experience that we ever experienced at McDonald's. We will never come here again unless the team manager look into this and take appropriate action to a better training to their team!
