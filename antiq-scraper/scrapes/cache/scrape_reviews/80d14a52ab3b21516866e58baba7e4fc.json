We were blown away by the customer service and knowledge of the staff. We ended up getting steak fillets, halibut, tuna and shrimp. Everything was fantastic! My brother owns a seafood restaurant so I am very particular when it comes to seafood and the quality. After the seafood de thawed it had a sweet smell with no  fishyness . I was able to make raw poke with the tuna and it was divine. Would 100% recommend Daily catch and now we place bi weekly orders so daily catch has been crucial towards us leading a healthier lifestyle with amazing seafood! Thank you Daily Catch!",

From the moment I walked in, I was impressed with the friendly and attentive customer service I received from the staff. They were more than happy to answer any questions I had about the products and make recommendations based on my preferences. The seafood at Daily Catch is absolutely top-notch. The freshness and quality of the seafood they sell is outstanding. They had variety of species to choose from and were all expertly handled and packaged. I especially enjoyed the local oysters and the fresh sashimi-grade tuna. The prices were very reasonable, and they had good deals on the specials of the day. I also appreciated the shops commitment to sourcing sustainable seafood. Its always good to know that the seafood Im purchasing is not only delicious but also responsibly sourced. Overall, I had an excellent experience at Daily Catch and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for high-quality and sustainable seafood. The customer service is top-notch and the seafood is outstanding. I will definitely be back!",

They also have a variety of smoked products that are either frozen or ready to eat. What ever you a looking for, they got it! There are so many things I love about this store, and I hope that more people take a trip down to the Drive to experience what the Daily Catch has to offer.",

I know nothing about seafood, and when I called about picking up something on Valentines, the person I spoke to was super helpful, and listed many great options with friendly enthusiasm. They answered all my questions, and encouraged me to come in to see things for myself. So I did, Valentines after work, when I thought they would be slammed/fried/out of everything. Instead, I met Matt, who took time to recommend me his go-to (steelhead), as well as how to cook it -- he added his favourite marinade, gave me the time/temperature/technique, and what touches he likes to add for best flavour. He could not have been nicer or more helpful. It turned out great, was totally delicious, and helped me look good in front of the girl I like...! These guys are great -- Matt for sure. I appreciate them being sustainable, and being so awesome about it. I will be back, I recommend them to everyone, and most of all -- thank them for being great! Theyre awesome -- huge props to Matt -- thank you!",
