            "review_text": "Ive always thought this restaurant seemed fun and got to give it a try today. The wooden interior is cozy and I feel like the decor is evoking a little bit genuine nostalgic feel and also a little humour. Our waiter was super nice and the other staff was also friendly. Walking to the washroom takes you right past the kitchen, which is interesting to take a look at but also may give some peace of mind that you can easily see exactly whats going on in there. Their menu is mostly the basic Thai dishes that you see at casual Thai restaurants in Canada, but I was really curious about their take on fish & chips and poutine, which sounded very unique compared to both other Thai food and the Canadian versions of these dishes. So this time I tried Bobs Fish & Chips: fried battered cod pieces topped with sliced mango, onion, basil, and chilies with two crispy curry rice cakes, in a tangy sauce. Its not a dish youd recognize as fish & chips without the context, but I can see where the inspiration was drawn from. I thought it was really tasty! The vinegar sauce was zippy and refreshing and I really liked the flavour and crunchy crust of the rice balls. When I first got a look at it I was skeptical that it was really enough food to be worth $22, but the way they stacked the fish pieces was deceiving because there was actually a lot of fish, and I was fully satiated after finishing. I also tried their house tamarind ginger soda which was very good too! I was expecting it to be spicy like ginger beer and it was really mostly sweet because the tamarind is more pronounced than the ginger, but still a tasty and refreshing drink. My friend got the Chicken Cashew Nut for her meal and enjoyed it as well. There was enough that she ate only half and saved the rest (although shes not a big eater - I think with my appetite I couldve finished it or nearly finished it but been very full). Id say its a safe bet for standard downhome Thai food, and if you want to get a little experimental, the Fish & Chips is definitely worth trying. The positive atmosphere ties it all together.",

            "review_text": "Awesome spot on Main Street for Thai food! Ordered the Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles with Prawns, and Tom Yum Soup. Both noodles were very flavourful and the soup was the perfect balance of sour and spicy. All dishes had a good serving of prawn which were well sized. Also had a Thai iced tea which was refreshing and was the perfect level of sweetness. Service was also amazing - they were attentive, responsive, and quick to do the small things like remove chopstick/straw wrap from the table and bring take out containers. I definitely recommend Bob Likes Thai Food, and will go again!",

But along the way, we would like a little bit of service. And thats where Bob Likes Thai Food gets top marks. The young man serving our table, recently moved to Canada only a few months ago from Thailand. His service was friendly, outgoing and impeccable. He was patient and gave us so much time, not rushing us. Even when he was clearing up plates from our table and people at my table were speaking with him, he put the plates back down and listened like he really wanted to hear what we were saying. All the other staff that we interacted with in the restaurant from the server to the dishwasher where also amazing. Nice environment. Well done. Oh and by the way, the food was great. Drunken prawns noodle dish all the way. Vegetarian options: There are vegetarian options available. Parking: Free two hour parking and laneway parking. Wheelchair accessibility: Seems to be okay.",

I love their super spicy Pad Thai, and my kids love their lichee wrapped with bacon and pineapple. What a great combo. I would recommend going with friends so you can order a wide variety of things. Such as the  fish and chips  because this version has gone  Bob  style.  The greater question you should ask them is  who is bob ?",

I started eating a certain style of Thai fried rice about 20 years ago, and was very happy that the staff here were willing to customize the dish just the way I liked it. For such a busy  restaurant, I didnt expect them to be able to accommodate it. I understand there is another location too, but I havent tried it yet. Thanks Bob, whoever you are!",

The Pad Thai was perfect and probably the best i ve ever had, i then had the Miang Kam which was a wonderful experience, I d seriously recommend trying these when in this place, it was every flavour possible in a single mouthful. The Waitress we had was also really helpful and she clearly cared about the place which is really nice to see. 11/10",
