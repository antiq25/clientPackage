However, Im happy to see that non-Chinese shoppers patronize places like this. TYVM! I even heard one of the workers speak in fairly good English to the White Euro looking shoppers. These shoppers seem satisfied with their purchases. Please keep Chinatown businesses going by choosing to shop here than in T&T or in other places. Come explore Chinatown, experiment with products that you can buy here n with all of our help, hopefully Chinatown businesses will come back to their former glory . Id love that",
