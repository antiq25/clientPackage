One of our group vowed that she didnt like Salmon but she sure enjoyed this Salmon Burger and is now a convert.  The $15 cost was well worth it for a freshly grilled generous Salmon portion~ hope we get to enjoy the same next year!  A small favour ~ It would be nice to have the option of different types of Buns, besides a White Bun ~ thank you!",

The display counters have been redone, the displays look far more appealing, and I was really happy to see fresh sockeye from Barclay Sound (it always seems to be previously frozen, which I dont mind as the price is a bit better). I need to go back and pick up some frozen shrimp. Love the selection in the frozen section. Keep up the great work!",

Spoke with Stevie who said yes they had Sockeye. The price was quite reasonable. We got our Salmon. They dressed, cleaned and cut off the fins - ready for canning. The fish was fresh and the service was superb. They have many other varieties of fresh and frozen fish and sea food.  And sauces and spices. I also talked with Cato, the store manager and knowledgeable about their products. They are oceanwise. Highly recommend this place.",

I usually go there to get shrimps, mussels, and a couple of different fish. The staff are always friendly and helpful. I have worked with James a couple  years back when I was working in the restaurant industry, and he is very knowledgable, friendly and always tries his best to meet the customers requests to make them happy! Last week, he had recommended to me their Arctic Turbot. I had tried it for my client and personally for myself, and we were impressed by how beautiful, succelent and buttery Arctic Turbot fish was. Now I have to say that Arctic Turbot is my top favourite fish. I am looking forward to try upcoming new fish/seafood they will be bringing in the store.",
