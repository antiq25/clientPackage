            "review_text": "CodeTactic built my website two years ago. Throughout the entire process, all promises to fulfill and execute deadlines were met. Technical language and systems were explained in a clear manner for someone without their background to grasp. CodeTactic ensured to understand my history, goals, and overall vision of what I needed my website to communicate. They took the time to ask all the questions necessary to ensure that we were always on the same page. Anytime I had questions and issues with anything they were quick to reply and provide solutions. The end result is CodeTactic delivered on what they promised. I loved what they created. They have built me a website that I am proud to own. The website is an accurate reflection of the high quality of my business. Their customer service continues to be quick, accurate, and helpful whenever I have a question with my site. I would highly recommend CodeTactic to anyone who is searching for a company to take care of such an important part of their business goals! Yohannes Petros Founder/Owner - Hanes Hummus",

A few years later when I decided that our company needed to make some changes to our online portal, I couldnt find the original web guy... Lesson learned. I found CodeTactic after talking to a few collegues as I needed a professional web development company.  The experience was fantastic the website far exceeded my expectations.  Highly recommend staying away from freelance designers.",
