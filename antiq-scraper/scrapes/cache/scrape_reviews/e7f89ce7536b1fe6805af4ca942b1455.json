I go to the aisle and am wondering about something, and there is a staff member who explained everything I needed to know. I have my purchases, and go to check-out. I tell a young man I need help because of my damaged gift card. He says I will help you. He is fun and friendly, and BOOM everything is taken care of.

He helped me carry the product to my car, found an empty counter for me to finish the payment quickly, gave tips on how to use the product correctly and was very friendly and helpful despite being extremely busy. I just had one part of the entire purchase that was a bit weird. The product is working fine but the no return/refund policy was weird. I initially thought that it would just be on this brand but when I checked, it was present for all AC products, it was not brand specific. I am not sure of the reason of this policy but that was the case when I visited this outlet. I do believe that any issues we can address with the brand itself.",

Was a bit shocked but I knew why and the policy is on their receipt so can t blame them, only myself for not reading the receipt clearly. HOWEVER Bonnie and the store manager (I presume) were super nice and accommodating and allowed me store credit that I promptly used right back into the store. THANK YOU for turning this situation around making an initially not great experience into one of exceeding my customer expectations. Very pleased with the outcome and the way Bonnie was trying to help me. This is one Canadian Tire I will make sure to visit often (it s a bit older but there s free parking and starbucks nearby so win win!).",

            "review_text": "Honestly one of the best Canadian tires I ve ever been too. I use to go to the market crossing one but due to their being more of a firearms and hunting section at bentall location I started going here. First off joe from the hunting sectional is a phenomenal character and well versed and knowledgeable on almost all firearms and  goods!  His passionate level of service has kept me coming back to browse and shop there for the past year! The sporting good section has an amazing selection and mostly well stocked in what ever you need! He helped me pick out a required firearm and even introduced me to local areas and groups. My second Major deciding factor or point is the Automotive service section.  I had the fortunate luck to notice a problem before a long trip at this location and after being looked at by a third party in the parking lot I rushed into Canadian tire to see if it was service able that weekend! That s where I talked to bill! If you have a chance I highly recommend talking through bill, he was so calm and intelligent on the matters. even while waiting in line to talk to him he was able to deal with and successfully handle a very insistent customer. Never even breaking his calm and collected demeanour! I highly recommend this store and their personal!",

She was super helpful! Then later on, unfortunately when my partner was looking for something else, he couldnt find anyone and so poked his head into the back where two employees were talking and laughing. I guess this annoyed the one male employee, who was then quite rude to my partner as he was asking questions. Even yelled from the back no goodbye or thank you? when my partner closed the door. He also didnt help show us where we needed to look for a particular item. Luckily the day was saved again my Mei Lin because she happened to be walking by and helped us with a few options and showed us exactly where we could go. Thanks Mei Lin :)",

            "review_text": "I wouldn t ever expect to give a Canadian Tire a 5 star review, but I had such a great experience at this location I thought I better share this positive feedback. As my family was preparing to leave for a camping trip early the next morning, we discovered our roof box was broken beyond repair, and since we don t camp light, getting a replacement was crucial. Canadian Tire s website showed a few models in stock, so a friend and I went down to check them out and buy one. It was about an hour before store closing, and I was feeling a bit stressed to be having to buy something without knowing much about the different brands and options. The automotive manager, Kyle, was happy to help, knew the products well, and had lots of good advice on things I wouldn t have thought to consider had he not suggested them. He even helped us get the roofbox installed on my car, and was cheerful and chill the whole time. I left the store confident with the purchase I had made and was so impressed by the quality of customer service.",

            "review_text": "Amazing customer service over the phone with Ward! I called in ahead of time to make sure they had an item because I had a terrible experience at another Canadian Tire location. You could hear that it was busy but Ward went out of his way to provide exceptional customer service. He asked for the item number and had support to make sure the item was available. He confirmed it was and told me what aisle it was in and the location where it would be in the aisle. I walked in, purchased the item and walked out within 5 minutes. My background to the whole experience below. I wanted to pick up Settlers of Catan and saw there were 7 available at the Cambie & 7th location. I went to the location and it took forever to find someone for support. When I did find someone, they told me it wasn t their department and to find the other rep. I found the other rep and had to chase after him as it felt like he was trying to avoid helping clients. Odd when you are hired to help clients. When I asked him about it he said if they are not on the shelf then it s going to be in a box somewhere as they are redoing their toy section. There were a bunch of boxes around the area but he was not even willing to walk over and look on the shelves or even offer to look into a couple of the boxes of items. He just said he can t help and smirked. I am purchasing this item as a family member of a friend of mine is battling cancer. This was a gift to bring their family together through the battle as I heard it s getting tougher at the moment. I was so angry that no one was willing to help. They were clearly unorganized and understaffed.",
