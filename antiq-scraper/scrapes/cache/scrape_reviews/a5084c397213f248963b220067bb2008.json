She is doing very well there; I am very glad of the strides she has made at Qawsain both in character and academia. Their program is well-rounded and they pay attention to all aspects in their students  life. The Quran, BC curriculum and Islamic studies programs are all expounded with a great deal of thought, and care and with Islamic pedagogy that seeks to preserve the natural disposition of the student. I recommend any parent to place their child in this school.",
