They have a great membership program that gives you access to a tanning bed, steam and sauna room, yoga studio, locker and unlimited fresh towels. The location is great as its right next to Save On Foods and Shoppers Drug Mart. They have all the equipment you need to do various workouts and multiple sanitization stations to wipe surfaces and equipments. Highly recommend people in Burnaby to go there once while exploring gym options.",

The condition of the simulators is constantly monitored by the master and repaired if necessary. There are several departments.  Hall for group lessons.  Place for exercise on the mat.  Separate room for girls who are shy. Great changing room.  There are double size lockers for full height.  Many mirrors, hair dryers, lotion.  There is even an iron. In the mens locker room 9 showers, shampoo, shower gel, hair conditioner.  In the shower clean. Large towel issued at the entrance. There is a Finnish and Turkish sauna. Several bars with drinking water. Vertical turbo solarium, several massage chairs. I used a free ticket for 3 visits during the week.  This is a super offer! There is a large underground free parking. Great location. Successful sport club.",

My first time in, a really friendly staff member gave me a tour and made me feel so at home. The gym is very clean, even the showers and towels. The staff always greet me upon entry and seem eager to answer any questions I may have. The atmosphere in the gym is really great due to the variety of people that attend. The women s section is quite small, but still has all equipment necessary to get a good workout in. The overall layout of the gym is really fantastic and there s plenty of space for a hiit setup, walking exercises or jump roping. Thank you for having created such a safe and welcoming environment. I definitely recommend this gym!!!",

They have a huge womens only section and a clean womens changing and shower room. I like how they maintain cleancliness there too. I love how I can bring any friend or my husband for free with me at any time with the monthly plan I purchased. I always leave with a contentment working out here and I dont think Ill ever transfer to any other clubs. The only thing tho, I hope you can also have childminding @noon on Fridays.

I have had the same trainer for 3 years plus and he has seen me through thick and thin. No matter what, the workouts were always geared towards what I could do....they were challenging...and I always come away having laughed, worked hard and with a feeling of success. Some days, as I fought Lyme disease, the workouts were super easy...no worries. It was what I could do that day. I do a number of sports like indoor rowing, triathlon, spin cycling, running, indoor rock climbing and open water swimming. The workouts help me in ALL disciplines. And for me, the trainers and the staff at this Goodlife feel like family. Its my go to place....feel 100% supported here.",

            "review_text": "I love this place! I was a GL member in Ontario and, when I moved to BC, I had to cancel my membership becasue there were not any locations here. It was an easy process and I spent the next few months trying different locations in the area to try and find a place that I liked as much. I finaly settled at one place and hated it so much that I barely went. I was SO happy to see a GL location here! I waited until I was able to cancel my membership with my other gym and I made an appointment with Louise to go over my options here. She was absolutely fantastic! Ive now been here for a few months and there is so much that I just love about this place. Here are a few highlights: 1. Great location. Think about it. Youre on your way home from work and you can hit the gym, grab that jug of milk that you needed from Price Smart and that prescription from Shoppers and not have to run all over the place doing it. 2. Gorgeous facility. GL has a ton of space with loads of new equipment. Every piece of cardio equipment has a little TV screen and an iPod/iPhone charger built into it. This means that the hour you spend sweating isnt boring and you also reduce the risk of dropping your iPhone because its attached to something. 3. Classes. The classes here are fantastic! There are a lot of free ones including Body Pump, Body Flow and Zumba. There is a seperate studio for spinning classes and those are free too. Yoga classes are in a much quieter area and are not included but are really not expensive. 4. Staff. I know that a lot of reviews here said that the staff are not good but Ive never had an issue with them and have always found them to be really nice. There are sales staff, customer service staff and trainers and they are all really professional and friendly. (As for the claim that they lied about cancelation fees - read the contract before you sign it because everything is in there. And if you keep your copies of the paperwork then its super easy to cancel things if you need to.) 5. The locker rooms. This might not seem like a big deal but when you have spent the last few years at a gym with rusty lockers, communal showers and not a single ammenity then this is a huge wow. The locker rooms are massive and nothing has been overlooked here. They provide irons and ironing boards, hair dryers, straighteners, curling irons, shampoo, conditioner, body wash etc right down to Q-Tips. There is a really nice sauna and there are two gorgeous little steam rooms in here too. I was really happy to see that there are about ten private shower stalls (and they are HUGE) because this means that I will never again have an old womans naked bum rub against me (that did happen and I was traumatized. True story!). 6. The training. I have not signed up for training here yet but I did go for the free consultation and Mike was great. He set up a workout schedule for me based on what I like to do and what I want to accomplish and he also gave me a lot of nutritional information. Ive already lost about ten pounds! 7. Motivation. GL offers optional workout cards that you can fill out when you complete workouts. They have a lot of incentives for people to get the results they want and everyone there is more than happy to do what they can to help members reach their goals (results = more customers). Definitely check this place out for yourself!",

            "review_text": "Dear Sarah, Its unfortunate that you failed to write the truth about your experience at Goodlife and with me. You neglected to mention that recording your workouts meant that you were actually filming them on your camera phone which goes completely against our member rules and etiquette, and you are also in breach of your membership. After politely asking you to stop filming the first time, you completely ignored my request. You continued to film and slam weights on several occasions (even after you asked my husband to step out of the way of your camera!) and I know for a fact that several other members and employees also had issues with you because they brought it to my attention. Sarah, our RPM group fitness instructor asked you politely to stop dropping the barbell (from waist high) as it was interrupting her class beside you when all the members continued to turn and look at you repeatedly. This was extremely loud and you were well aware of how it was disturbing other members. You just shrugged this off and didnt seem to care about how this was affecting others around you. Leila, our administrator also had a chat with you where she tried to explain the proper rules (all gyms are the same) but you didnt seem interested in hearing about it. You also said that when you signed up, the Fitness Advisor told you it was okay to film but when Leila asked who that advisor was, you couldnt give a name even though it is written on your contract. Simon, our manager is well aware of the situation and I can tell you this....after six years with Goodlife, never ONCE have I had a complaint against me. I know our rules and etiquette of the gym and slamming weights and filming are not part of them or any other gym. Since you claim to be a powerlifter perhaps its a blessing that you found another gym which specializes in powerlifting as Goodlife certainly doesnt fit your criteria. Good luck in your new gym. *Rachel....thank you for a refreshing review! We are working on connecting to wifi and should hopefully have it by the time you come back.",
