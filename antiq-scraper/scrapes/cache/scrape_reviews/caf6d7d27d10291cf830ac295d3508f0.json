The staff is quite friendly even though the restaurant is packed, you almost always need to wait 10 to 30 minutes to get a table. So what makes this attractive to so many people? The size is way more than generous, especially for todays economy in 2023. Be prepared to bring a takeaway box (unless you dont mind paying 50 cents for a paper box from the restaurant). One final note: the default tips amount is less than 15%, which is something you dont see anymore in todays Vancouver.",

Given this is a small restaurant with only 9 tables, Im impressed by the diversity and quality of the food. Furthermore impressed that most meals are at the $10 and $15 price points. Beef and mushroom sandwich: Was eclipsed by the fries, which were prepared my favourite way, with batter and crispy. The sandwich was nice too, lots of beef, tender and cooked medium rare the way I like. Only complaint was that there was some cartilage in the meat, which I had to cut out. Panko-fried pork chops: Again, lots of meat, two chops, which were tender, juicy, and just gently seasoned, the way I like. Chicken rice noodle soup had a perfectly  grilled boneless chicken thigh with crispy skin. Mixed grill: All meats grilled to textural perfection. Enough food for 2 people. Onion gravy good with fries. Service excellent, attentive, friendly, with a personal touch.",
