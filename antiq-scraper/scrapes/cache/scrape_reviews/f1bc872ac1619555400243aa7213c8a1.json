I was so scared of being refused because of his aggression while waiting outside but the trainer went to check how he was doing for me between her lessons(I guess that was on her break).

The service employee,   Chris,   went above and beyond to help me find products,    and he found an on sale I needed,   but didnt see.   Chris was very patient,   calm,   knowledgeable,   and is an example of what customers like myself appreciate when  shopping,   especially in a big box store.    I also liked their wide selection of products,    and their prices are not any more expensive than other pet supply stores.    Thank you,   Chris.    I hope the Petsmart management recognize and value your contribution to customer service,    its employees like you who help me  decide to shop there again.    Thank you !",

Sure enough, 4 days later we received a call. Went in to pick it up and Matt was extremely accomodating, he carried the cage right over to us and made the transaction happen seamlessly.

The location is just a short block walk from the skytrain.  The prices could make you weep, so all I can say on that note, is that the prices everywhere else seem to be just as bad, if not worse, which is also why I go there.  The toy selections are really good too. Very pet friendly, of course, I always meet a new dog friend or 2 when I go there.  Also, the cashier was very funny when I accidentally handed her the competitions savings card instead of the PetSmart card.  Said it happens all the time.   It took me about 15 minutes to spend $52 on cat food, half wet (cans), half dry.  My girl is a very happy kitty   tonight! She keeps going back to her dish for more kibble,  like every ten minutes.  I may have to ration her severely.   CHEERS everyone, love your furry friends, they so deserve it.",

Delivery option is a good add on, but they used FedEx, which is meant for businesses, and not good for residential addresses so thats something I hope PetSmart fixes. Canada Post would be much better for customers since if we miss delivery, its easy to go pick it up at a post office near by, while FedEx doesnt have that option and you cant tell what time of day they will try to deliver.",

Michelle was his groomer for the day, and she was so sweet putting my dog (and me) at ease. He had the full package   a haircut, his nails clipped, a bath... all of the above + some extras. When I picked him up, Michelle gave me some tips & tricks on what I can do to make his next appointment easier (i.e. she said he didn t like his chin being touched, so I should train him to make him comfortable with that). That was super helpful! And despite the fact that we re still in Phase 2 of Covid-19, and they re not allowed to have 2+ stylists on a dog (for their physical distancing safety), Michelle still did a really good job with my dog s nails solo. I would definitely recommend this location and Michelle as a stylist to anyone.",
