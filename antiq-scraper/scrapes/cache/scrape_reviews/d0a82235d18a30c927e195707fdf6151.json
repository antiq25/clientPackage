Customers often wait while people work with their heads down not acknowledging anyone, even to say they ll be with them in a minute.

A few times I ve refilled my prescription ahead of time only to arrive and find it s not ready or the medication is not available, yet no one bothered to contact me. One time I was told to return in 45 min which I did after waking around the store to be told my medication wasn t in stock yet no one bothered to call me.

If I could give them  -1 star I would, and that s why I try to avoid going to that pharmacy as much as possible.  Unfortunately, this time it was an emergency and I had to go to the nearest one asap. I was promised 40 minutes, but after 40 minutes, I was told that I have to wait another 15, then another 10 minutes. Finally after almost an hour and a half I got my medication, but at this point the pharmacist noticed that I am allergic to penicillin and the capsules I got belong to the penicillin group of medication, in spite of that she sold it to me and advised that I just take Benadryl if I feel sick. I called my doctor and explained the situation, he said that I absolutely shouldn t experiment and see if I get sick or not. He called the pharmacy and changed the prescription.  I had to wait another hour for the new prescription to be ready (of course they didn t take back the first one), but the best part was when my wife told them that their service is poor she got the answer,  then don t come here . We certainly will take their advice and NEVER shop there again.",

She did not tell me to stay around 15 min or confirm allergies.

My biggest concern was the lack of pre-administration safety checks and post-vaccine instructions to stay around.  The women behind the counter were friendly and helpful.",

            "review_text": "My family has 10+ years of experience getting prescriptions filled at this pharmacy.  In the years I been there, at least 5 or 6 different crews of people have served me, which means this pharmacy has a hard time hanging on to staff. On more than one occasion I was dispensed the correct medication, but it was dispensed to me under the wrong Physician prescriber name!!  Even after both my physician and I pointed this out to the pharmacist manager, it happened again. The main problem at this pharmacy is poor customer service. A lot of the problems at the North Vancouver Superstore Pharmacy can be placed squarely on the shoulders of the management team. Putting consumer needs first, need to be a key element of the workplace culture. Without good customer service, who one cares if this store can get the right pills in a container (any pharmacy can do this). Pharmacy improvements could include: improvements to workplace culture thereby improving the satisfaction of the workers which in turn trickles down to the customers, friendliness, having Rxs ready when the pharmacy say they will be ready, fulling Rxs faxed in by physicians offices, calling customer/doctor to clarify (instead of waiting until the customer shows up) thereby forcing the customer to wait another 30 mins, calling the customer when the Prescription cant be filled. I ve moved my family to a much better pharmacy where we get much better care.",
