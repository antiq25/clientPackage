            "review_text": "The five course tasting menu explores a global array of spices and influences paired with beautifully sourced ingredients. Located in the West End, down a set of stairs off Davie St, Arike is an approachable and global dining experience. Every course had a remarkable variance in spice and heat, even the bread which contained bebere spice. My favourite courses were the Moroccan Ratatouille and the Sea Bream Ceviche. The ceviche was notably spicy, in a delightful way, and presented with a peanut hummus. I also had the wine pairing which was a stellar accompaniment. My sister found the melon course with the serrano sofrito and yogurt foam as her favourite. The meal was a wonderful progression from start to finish and we were delighted by it all.",

We have both visited and lived in various East African countries and were curious to taste the mix of these flavours with local ingredients. Arike delivered, and then some. We also really enjoyed the unique cocktail menu. Some of these cocktails were unlike any wed ever had. Well be back, and with friends next time.",

We had a chicken sausage + red pepper ( I think) gnocchi + mint chutney + baked manchego crisp. Sound good enough yet? Each item on its own was good, like fine, but together it was a sensational eating experience. As if that wasnt enough, the wine pairings were phenomenal (the two of us split one), and the ambience and decor topped it off. Hats off to Sam the chef, Jesse (who Im told did the wine pairings), and Jen the wonderful, fun hostess. Check out Arike when youre in town! And be sure to ask what the logo means :)",

We turned right walking down Davie street down the stairs when we discovered the absolute best bar experience we have ever had in the city. The bartender shared his experience of how his experience through Africa inspired his drinks... we were beyond impressed, he took us on a journey we never thought we would experience in the city. Sweet, sour, elegant, sophisticated, smooth... the city used to be boring and cloudy, but I found my place to enjoy the sun while all of you suckers hide under your umbrellas.

Service and the food were all amazing. The presentation, colours and flavours of all the food continue to impress. Original: Arike has quickly become one of my favourite restaurants in Vancouver. Its an amazing experience with great service and Nigerian fusion food done in a fine dining style. Fritters were next level. The flavour and texture. Onion rings were awesome (though small portion) and the cassava fries were good too. They both came with great sauces. Tried the ox tail and pork belly flat bread which was amazing and so was the joffi rice with beef tenderloin. The rice was so flavourful and the beef just melted in your mouth. Tried both desserts and they were amazing too. Best mini donuts ever... almost like gulab jamun mini donuts and best ice cream in West End.",

The Cocktails & Flatbreads were to die for. The Cassava Fries were crispy on the outside, soft & fluffy on the inside & the sauces that accompanied them were delicious. The Chicken Wings were well seasoned with a bit of heat, exactly what one would look for in a great Wing. The Corn Fritters were nothing like Ive ever tasted & they had a great little bite of heat. The Pof Pofs, were described as little donut holes but I can tell you right now theyre better than any donut hole Ive ever had & were the perfect way to end our meal. Although this restaurant hasnt been open for long, I know its going to make a name for itself, so grab some friends & head on over there before the word gets out & you have to wait months for a table.

The joloff rice has quite a kick to it so if youre into spicy food, definitely try it out. The beef was excellent and the flavors together really worked. Dont get me started about the corn fritters!! As for the flatbread, well that one hit the nail in the head. With the caramelized onions and the sweetness, oh dear! Well definitely be back until were tried every single item on the menu.

So tender and flavourful. Just the right amount of sweet too. Will definitely be back.",

            "review_text": "My wife and I had a great meal here.  A pleasant, understated interior with well spaced tables, and interesting music that was at a reasonable volume   you could have a conversation. Excellent service, our server was very knowledgeable about the food and wine, appeared like magic when you need something, and let you eat in peace when you didn t. The menu changes frequently, but I expect that it will always be of very good quality given our experience. We started with a perfect brioche with Tiger Nut giving it an unique flavor with thin butterscotch on top. A tasty, if sticky way to start the meal. Then a mango dish. We were told it was compressed mango which must made the flavour more intense because it was very intense. The leaves and spices all came together for a very good overall flavor. Next up a yam dish. I m not a big fan of vegetarian dishes (a true omnivore, I am), but I really enjoyed this one. Once again, some new, very good flavours combined in a perfectly executed dish. Then fish, a thin piece of fish on top of fluffy spiced rice, and again a great combination of flavours and textured. Final meat dish was rabbit, but rabbit unlike any I ve had before. I really enjoyed the Nigerian (and other parts of Africa) flavours that were used to inspire these dishes. Dessert gets its own paragraph. I find that dessert is often the poor cousin at restaurants. Not much thought goes into it. It is pretty common to see a sorbet, a Creme Brule, and something chocolate on the dessert menu. You don t get a choice here, but it was wonderful. A cylinder of pasty with spiced apples cubes inside, a creme caramel, and something light and coiled on top. My description isn t doing this dessert justice. It looked great, and tasted better. Not too sweet, not too heavy, a nice combination of flavours and textures, and the chef obviously put a lot of thought, time, and care into creating it. All in all, one of the better meals I ve had in Vancouver. Being Vancouver, it was raining, but in the summer the restaurant is steps way from a nice walk at English Bay which could be a nice activity after a great meal.",

So good as was the goat dumplings (did not photo). We came for the Dine Out Vancouver experience however their main menu looked so yummy. Im glad we decided to sample a few items off the menu and shared everything. I believe thats the best way to go with their menu. Were already planning a double date night as we want come back here soon. Definitely check it out as I believe its a hidden gem. Considering how much food we ordered including a drink each, the bill was under $85. I was surprised we had the whole restaurant to ourselves even though we arrived at 19:30 on a Wednesday.",

My Night starts with a warm welcome I choose to Sit at the bar to enjoy good banter with a great bartender, he knew his cocktails and his wine. The atmosphere and small tucked away location were excellent. As an east coaster the idea of Nigerian food would be extremely foreign and unknown to me. The bartender and server were able to explain the menu to me in a very clear way what the food entitled. It was excellent , menu was very small which I enjoyed as I was able to try 4 different items in the menu, One as great as the next. I can t wait to go back with a bigger party to enjoy everything on the menu. I can t comment on its authenticity ( I ve never had Nigerian food ) but it seemed pretty legit to me. I sure hope this one sticks, The west end and Vancouver need a spot like this.",

            "review_text": "Amazing. They have happy hour from 3-6 and after 9 (some appies, flatbreads and drinks are cheaper) as well as daily drink specials. We ordered one flatbread, an appy, and a side to share amongst the four of us. The suya BBQ chicken wings ($11 during happy hr, $15 regular) were juicy, warm and finger-licking good, and definitely a good deal for the price since we got about 1lb/12 wings. The oxtail and pork belly flatbread ($17) was a bit spicier than wed expected, but the heat wasnt overpowering and the sweet caramelized onions paired perfectly with the richness of the cheese. The cassava fries ($7) were golden and crispy on the outside but as fluffy as mashed potatoes on the inside, though the cashew garlic mayo was much less flavourful than the hot and sweet tomato dip. For around $10 per person, it was a filling and very affordable meal. The server was incredibly friendly and charismatic. I also loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. A lovely cocktail bar, dim lighting and a hidden but cozy location make Arike the perfect place to meet with friends and family and share conversation over good food.",

Roman behind the bar knows his cocktails, and how to run a bar: its the best French 75 Ive had this side of the Atlantic.  The chefs are knocking it out of the park on the food side: the spoonful of braised goat is that perfectly executed hors doeuvres with sandwiches and salads that go well beyond expectations, but its the unique flatbread and, in my personal opinion, the dumplings, that really stand out.  Dessert was the real kicker: in house ice cream with caramel and pumpkin seed puree, paired with a shot of espresso. I was in heaven.  Almost makes me wish it was an affogato. Lastly, this place is spotless.  Its refreshing to be in a place that is as clean behind the bar as it is out front.  To quote a patron I heard the evening I visited: You could do heart surgery back there.  Worth the visit.  You wont leave disappointed.",

I loved my time there and didnt feel uncomfortable eating alone at one of the communal high tables, the staff were excellent and made great recommendations. The goat spoon with spicey ata din din sauce and crushed peanuts is a good way to start your meal. Most plates are for sharing and I highly suggest the three-month cured lamb flatbread because it bursts with flavour. Both the desserts are great and not too sweet, the ice cream has a thick pumpkin seed smear which is very unique, the pof pofs are light deep fried sweet bundles of goodness. Overall a great dinner for those who like carb-based smaller shared plates with five star local service.",
