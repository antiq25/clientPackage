If you havent had a seafood boil, you might wanna google before you go. It was nice to see the place busy! They had a wide selection of seafood and other options to choose from. We had the Lobster, Dungeness, and crawfish among a few other things. It was great. Everything was cooked well. They do state that there is a headless shrimp option also! It costs a small amount more but you do get more. We were full by the end. The only complaint was with our server. We werent offered any drinks except water and had to get the attention of another waitress to take our drink order. We also sat and waited a long while after finishing before letting someone know we were ready for the bill. We noticed our waiter pacing/loitering at the other end of the restaurant but never checked on us. We felt bad bugging the lovely waitress who was being diligent with her own tables.",

            "review_text": "We were a little apprehensive at first given some of the poor reviews but definitely glad we tried this place out for ourselves! It was delicious and we had a great experience. SERVICE Not sure why the other reviews say bad service because the servers were wonderful! They did seem quite busy (looked like 2 servers for the whole restaurant) but they were personable and v helpful. FOOD Seeing other reviews complaining about the spice seems really silly - it s a seafood boil so of course it s going to be at least a little spicy. Cajun is crucial for this type of cuisine! It s how they do it down south. If you don t like spice, try another cuisine lol We got the  luxury for 2  and that was the perfect amount of food for us two. Ours came on a plate and the crab was delicious. Loved the lotus roots that were perfectly cooked. The corn was a bit bland  but just soaked it up in the sauce (we went mild which was just enough spice). Yes, the shrimps comes w head on and there s no cutlery aside from the seafood cracker. Again, this is standard for seafood boils. We didn t bother with gloves - best to just go all in! Overall, great experience and would come again.",

Next time, I go full spicy They did not have the King Crab but, they were more then willing to substitute with more Lobster or Dungeness and we did both  . It was my first time eating here and I already want to go back. Pricey, but worth it, says I",

            "review_text": "Captain Boil is a big franchise seafood restaurant. It has more than 30 restaurants across Canada in different cities. There are five locations in the Great Vancouver area. I have been to the two locations before: one is on Robson St. Downtown and another one is on Kingsway Vancouver. Both of the locations served quite delicious seafood. Very enjoy eating at Captain Boil. Captain Boil Robson St. Location is at 1487 Robson St, Vancouver, BC V6G 1C1. The location is on the one of busiest st downtown Vancouver. There are many restaurants on this street, attract so many customers. I had lunch with my friend at this location. we had a great experience there. We arrived at the restaurant around 12 pm when it just opened. So, the restaurant was not busy. Since it s on the weekend, it didn t serve the lunch combo. We decided to order seafood separately. We ordered Shrimps, Mussels, and Snow Crab legs 1lb each with Cajun, Captain s Boil and Garlic sauces. All the seafood we ordered comes in the arrival of the mains, not on plates, but straight out of the boiling pot with flavors added, delivered to the table still steaming hot in big (biodegradable)  clear-plastic bags!  Mussels are my most favorite dish in this place. They are big and very great quality.",

They lay down paper, give you gloves and bibs. This equates to less nudity, and more enjoyment of the food. ( Which I rate 9/10. )",

            "review_text": "Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Had a coupon for shrimp.  The medium spicy Captains boil sauce on a pound of shrimp plus a corn add-on was very tasty.  Spice level was perfect for me, and the shrimp was not overcooked. Seafood fried rice was good and was a big portion that would have been plenty to share as a side for several people. I wound up putting some of the sauce with the juices from the shrimp from the bag on the rice, and its a shame that most people will waste it (would be nice if there could be some comp bread for this).  Service was very friendly. Only open for about a month, so Im giving them some slack on running out of the clams that I was looking forward to getting.  Im sure they will work that out as they go along or maybe just everyone wanted clams today.  Place was comfy.  Only thing is that there isnt always real dishware.  Water comes in disposable plastic cups instead of glasses or even reusable plastic cups, and the pop is just served in the can. But the rice came on a real plate with a metal spoon. I didnt use the plastic bib (though did use paper napkins tucked in my shirt) and gloves to try to cut down on the plastic waste but everyone else in the place did.  The bags for the seafood are biodegradable though at least.",
