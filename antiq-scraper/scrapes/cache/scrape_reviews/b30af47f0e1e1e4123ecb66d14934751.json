I came to see the two household appliances that were advertised and scored excellent buys. Brightly lit aisles and well stocked displays. The microwave oven section was half empty but I managed to find a boxed Cuisinart air fryer convention toaster oven in stock as advertised at 50% off along with an additional $50 discount at the checkout! Wow! I also purchased a magic bullet brand personal blender on sale for $29.95. This place is a wonderful store for incredible buys. I come often to purchase specials from their flyers when there are things we need. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable. They publish and distribute a flyer every week or every other week depending on the season. This place is advertised as an automotive store but it has so much more to offer with a great selection of housewares, sporting goods and making your home beautiful. Well worth a visit.",

What I really liked about this location is that they have their patio/outdoor furniture setup and on display. This way you can test out the furniture to see if it s what you were envisioning online. The other CTs don t really do this so this one was great for that. One thing though is this one doesn t have any self checkout stations and there was a huge lineup and only one person jumped on to another cashier to help the one cashier for the longest time.

It s easy to reposition to eye level, and can hold any phone size. After three months of use when the product was super tight in the socket, I had a small issue by pulling the plug out on an angle too fast. Rather than fixing it, I returned it to the store with my triangle card and exchanged it for a new one. They found my receipt by tracking the purchase date. Very satisfied with service and auto accessories!",

I was so lucky to get Connors service. He asked a couple of questions to make sure I did need to change the battery. He even took his time to test the battery for me. When I decided to change the battery, he recommended the reasonable one for me. He also offered me two options to replace it: let their machinists do that for me (charge 68$) or by myself. In order to save the money, I chose to do that by myself.  I asked Connor to lent me the tools and tried it. Unfortunately, it was not as simple as I thought and gave it up, and I turned to the machinists for help, but none of them were available at that moment and asked me to leave my car there and they might replace it tomorrow. I was so disappointed and turned to Connor for help again. By the rule, Connor is not allowed to replace the battery for me, but he still be so nice to stand beside and guide me how to do that properly. With his instructions, I finally replace my battery. To be honest, I bothered Connor so many times today, but he was so patient and offered me the best service all the time! Connor, thank you so much for saving my day!",

Joe from the Automotive Service Department answered and told me to bring my vehicle in.  He said that it would probably take a few hours because they have quite a few vehicles in for servicing today.  He managed to somehow squeeze me in and had me back on the road in under an hour.  I cant thank Joe enough.  From the turnaround time to the service to the professionalism, I am extremely satisfied.  Joe and the Asian Mechanic with the blonde highlights (Sorry I didnt catch his name) was amazing.  Thank you once again :)",

Now i have seen alot of repairs on my own vehicles over the years and spentalot of time wrenching my trucks in the parking lot just like my dad would do . And my favorite part as a kid was getting to keep the canadian tire money. Over the years its been growing into a great all round needs kinda store there house brand is become very compeditive with the big name power tools and at a price way below which is a good thing for the low budget people or if you are just a tight wad like my self . They have a great spray paint selection for those small paint jobs or brush on or larger sprayer paints as well as all your paint accessories.  The auto motive section is large and user friendly lay out for the self serve types or if you need help well good luck on fast service and when you get it its rare to find an employee wllling to solve your needs if they dont have what you need .that being said  i think over all this world would not be the same without canadian tire . Im glad its there for my needs . I highly recomend this store for someone who has not already experianced the good this store has .",

            "review_text": "Canadian Tire stores around the Vancouver lower main land have been going through some renovations. This is a brilliant opportunity to find great deals on clearance sales as the store shifts its shelves they have lowered prices on items that have not been selling or the remainder of seasonal products. This is a wonderful store with great staff members who greet you when you arrive, help you find whatever you need while you are there and assist you when you are leaving. There are a couple of really amazing managers who treat the customers well and the staff seem content which probably means they are given the respect they deserve. All in all Canadian Tire is my favorite store and it is amazing that this fanchise has given their customers rewards since the begining. Canadian Tire money is the first reward system and that has changed our retail experience because now all stores have reward programs. This is a great sorce of pride for this corporation and a part of our culture which protrays a national identity which we all can be excited to be a part of. Support this store and you will not be dissapointed but rather fulfilled with quality and reasonably priced products.",
