Ordered the lobster roll and some oysters - both were great options accompanied by a glass of white. Loved my choices, but also wished I could have ordered more. Probably the best fries I had in Vancouver too.",

Everything was cooked fresh to order and was expertly made! The clam chowder was full of flavour and had generous servings of clams, mussels and shrimp. It was delicious and buttery! Fish tacos were pan fried, simple and fresh. Great prices for happy hour. Excellent service. Will be back!",

The best part is getting to know the servers on an individual level, they are all so friendly and unique.....the OUTSTANDING SEAFOOD and ambience of a bustling beachside neighborhood is a bonus. The food is ABSOLUTELY worth coming here for.. BELIEVE ME....the oysters and everything else on the menu are 2DIE4...but its the service and waitstaff that makes this place truly unique and special. This place is definitely my go to spot for fresh seafood and oysters. Youll have a heck of a good time at Papis guaranteed!!!.",

We had travelled from YYZ, and walked towards English Bay from our hotel, searching for sunlight, a terrific view  warm breezes, comfortable patio, relaxation, and good food. We were pleasantly surprised, actually thrilled to find all at Papis! The food - excellent! The service - extraordinary, music perfect. Sunlight, terrific view, terrific service! Oh my goodness, this is great! We both remarked we hit a 10 of 10 on the relaxation scale - instantly. Many, many thanks to the terrific team, and the location. Well be back! With Gratitude, Jay and Anne Paterson,",

We tried a selection of Oysters, the Prawn Arancini and Crab Cakes to start. Hands down some of the best crab cakes I ve eaten in Vancouver. We then shared a fish and chips for the main course. Wow! I m Australian and haven t found a place that makes fish and chips like the motherland until now. The batter was cooked to perfection, not too heavy and I really loved that they had two fish to select from. Huge shout out to the General Manager Dan for making our date night so special. I was surprised that a GM would personally serve our table but that is the vibe Papi s provides. It s not too big. You don t feel like a number. The service is so friendly and you won t leave disappointed. Highly recommend for a trip to the West End! Thanks Papi s!!",

Our server was doing double duty and clearly communicated expectations as they were short staffed. That being said drinks were out in fiver or fewer minutes, food under ten min tutes. Juicy oysters, great ambiance, phenomenal view. Server also had excellent manners which is very much appreciated. Will certainly be back.",

More than that,  the food are exceptional. We had their lobster roll, fried fish (can t remember the name, haha. Long ones for apples), fries, oysters and their seafood curry. It is to die for. If you like rich, exotic and full of flavour. This is a must! Have it with pasta or dip it in bread or eat it as is. Delisioso. The staff were on the younger demographic but they great. Very polite and easy to talk to. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to lounge and drink or to have a feast. Will come again!",

Turned out to be a perfect restaurant to start the culinary experience at Vancouver.  The restaurant was perfect ambience with sunset views from the patio and amazing seafood.   I tried the fish tacos which were light and had light tangy flavour and then for the first time ever I tried a lobster roll.  I was not disappointed. The creamy buttery lobster with their secret sauce was finger licking good and went great with their cocktails, specially mezcal based drink called smoke and mirrors! Our server were friendly and patient.  Pro-actively checked on us and made sure we were enjoying our meal. Would definitely recommend this to everyone!",

Great spot for people watching too. Amazing West End #WeAmaze Below is my older post from when they first opened. Went last night and sat at a sunny, safe table on the patio. Rebecca was our great waitress. Sampled some oysters and tuna tataki, happy hour wine. Nice first date in a long time. Best patio location. The menu has improved quite a bit since it was Beach Bay Cafe. Limited wine selection though, its either red or white. They have a delicious cocktail called a Sea Wall Banger that is wildly refreshing. He had the fish and chips and was well impressed. I had the kale, quinoa summer beet salad and it was scrumptious. They just opened and a few growing pains Im sure they will overcome in no time.",
