I wish that every sub trade was as strong as BC Floors. Keit the project manager was communicative and professional. She kept me regularly up to date through texts and phone calls throughout the work. The workers were respectful and diligent. We installed a new lvt floor. BC Floors looked after the demolition and new install. The team met an aggressive timeline and the final product is extremely well done. 10/10",

The projects professional installers, Jhoemar and Juan completed my vinyl sheet installations with perfection. Their politeness, hard work ethic, and installation knowledge was remarkable.

Also the installation went like clock-work, precise and with proper workmanship, including removing and reinstalling the heavy oak pews back in its exact position. We at Guardian Angels parish have nothing but praise for the organization and installation of this beautiful flooring.

So finding a contractor, that also supplies the product was an amazing discovery. When I first contacted the company, I was introduced to their account manager, Keit, and I have to say that Keit went beyond the scope of her work to ensure that as a customer, everything was laid out in a transparent and clear manner. She replied to all my inquiries in a professional and knowledgeable way. It was also very convenient that BC floors acted as a one stop shop, that had almost every type of flooring you can think of. I found their prices to be very competitive, and for the quality and speed of the work done, you are getting your moneys worth. I would certainly recommend BC flooring in the future, and if your lucky enough to get Keit as your account manager, it will make the whole renovation/new build process much more seamless.",

Although not recommended and quite difficult to do the team at BC Floors pulled together and advised me how to make it happen. From the moment I met Keit, the company rep and project manager I knew I was in good hands. Also the installers Bijon and Korish were obvious trade professionals and the best in the business. The floor job looked totally amazing in the end. I would highly recommend this company and they have experience in condos and strata rules .",

            "review_text": "The project manager, Eric, was very organized, friendly, and professional.  He orchestrated various trades such as tilers, plumbers, painters, drywallers, and so forth to install our flooring.  This included water proof laminate in our legal basement suite and a quartz counter top.  Our main floor tile was replaced to create a more modern feel in conjunction with our hardwood while our en-suite bathroom was completely re-formed into a beautiful Roman inspired modern bathroom! Eric went above and beyond helping us during our three month renovation and was able to problem solve using evidence based rational thought instead of  winging  it or just  going with his gut.   This resulted in solid solutions at reasonable prices.  Although the renovations weren t cheap, the price for quality of work (and we chose higher end materials) was worth it.  As has been said, you can have something cheap, fast, and correct but you can only ever get two of the three so if you want a quality job at a reasonable price then it might take a little longer but if you remain flexible, then it s worth it in the end. Thanks to Eric and BC Floors and we will definitely recommend them to friends and family!",

The guys were very helpful over the phone and then later when they came down for an estimate of work load and pricing.  The installation work was pushed back a couple of times due to my hectic schedule and an unexpected business trip out of town, but they were very accommodating every time (Thanks again Maxim and Oleg!).  The guys are very professional, knowledgeable and super efficient - cant say enough how easy it was to deal with them! We love our new fluffy carpet, now the room is the best-looking one in the whole house :) We just couldnt be more pleased with the results! Highly recommend to anyone in need of a floor makeover!",

Customers that compose mean spirited reviews instead of being grown up enough as an adult to avoid appearing vindictive, childish, infantile and just plain dishonest simply because they are paying?!. This type of demeanour and or deceptive mentality, was not so prevalent back in the early 1980s, when customers were much more Civil & Understanding.",

            "review_text": "Friendly helpful and accommodating. Prices and selection were very competitive. Installed luxury vinyl plank. Interaction with staff in office and on site was good but project did take about 3 times longer than quoted. There was more leveling work than anticipated which added understandable time but there were delays due to running out of materials and conflicting schedules with other projects. They did confirm my painters could come paint mounted baseboards one day but painters had to go home when they showing up and baseboards had not been mounted as promised. Was also promised exact material match on stair noses but was told on day of install that it would be best match similar material. It looks great but misleading promise on sales floor. Translucent silicone used on edges of half the stairs and white caulk use on there half because they ran out of materials which looks strange now. Some risers have scuffs and glue marks. Also last minute changes from vinyl transition to metal transitions for technical reasons on slope of transition which should have been identified in two site visits before project started. They worked to rectify issue and supplied extra transitions so we can change them on our own in the future. Had a hard time getting all baseboards remounted as agreed and ended up remounting some on my own to save time on project and not have to keep asking. Had to point out several corrective action where material did not hide properly under baseboards, stairs etc. These were corrected quickly but ended up leaving some because I got tired of pointing them out and having to schedule site visits. Told me they would screw down plywood floors in areas that had squeaking but this not done. Quite a bit of scuffs on jewly painted walls and resedue of leveling compound on some walls which I had to scrape off.  I am very conflicted in this review because they did try there best to fix things but it seems like lots of the things should have just been done right the first time. We are happy with the floors and would have given a higher rating if we didnt have to go through the little stresses along the way. It may have just been a bad month but I would have a hard time referring them to friends and family after our experience. Bitter sweet unfortunately.",

            "review_text": "Installation was decent overall, but they messed up one of the rooms and had to cover it up with awkward looking panels near the edges where the floor ends at floor-to-ceiling windows. Other issues: - Original expectations were that they would do the kitchen flooring as well. But they bailed on doing the entire floor because of some custom cabinetry that is raised above the flooring on elevated stilts. So half of the kitchen flooring is incomplete (old flooring hidden under the cabinetry). Would have been much better to be up front about that at the beginning. - They promised to replace our baseboards, but during the renovations they said the original baseboards were fine and asked if they would just use those. We ask for them to go ahead with new ones thing they would do the full job. Instead they cut new baseboards without painting them properly and never added caulking. So we were left to do that our selves. - They messed up one of our closet doors (couldn t get it to fit back in) so they cut it. Now the one door doesn t match the height of the other. Overall, a lot of the issues could have been prevented with better communication on their part before and during the project. They also rushed at the end to finish up. We offered to give them more time, but they already had other projects waiting to go right afterwards.",

They basically act as middle man and subcontract your project to others that literally have no knowledge of flooring and they will ruin your material and flooring. First off, I had to call Keit, the project manager to give me a quote, literally everyday two to three times. After a full week of calling her, she finally gave me a sloppy quote without coming to my place to see what the scope is. I had a tight schedule and made the worst mistake to pay them to do the job. Then their subcontractor came to my place without knowing what the scope of work is. He was supposed to remove the existing flooring on the stairs and install new stairs using the materials I have bought. He totally damaged all of the stairs while removing the existing stairs and noted that the floors now need leveling and demanded more money. As I was deep into this mistake, I agreed. Then he installed all flooring and stairs wrong and ruined the whole floor and stairs. The stairs nosing fell off after 2 days and I noticed that it is sitting on a hollow space!!! The flooring moves when I walk on it. When I complained to Keit, BC Floors PM, she accused me that I am lying. I had to fight a whole week with BC floors to prove that their subcontractor has ruined my materials and the stairs. After fighting for over a week and getting penny pinched along the way and arguing with me over every $10 I paid, I ONLY got around 88% of my money back and NOT the full payment. I have already spent more than $1000 out of pocket and still need to find another contractor to fix my stairs. I have never experienced such horrible service and customer service. So, if you really value your time and money, I recommend finding another company for your floors. Otherwise, you will end up losing lots of money and time.",

It means that there is someone who is always there at the showroom. Please understand that estimating is an art and not something exact and maybe you misunderstood that the lady is up selling you. She is also an estimator but may not be familiar with your case. In construction, every project is unique. It is best that you speak with the guy you normally speak so things will be consistent.

            "review_text": "As it stands, weve paid $3,500 in labour and lost $1,000 in materials for BC Floors to destroy our staircase. Keit and Nikita are dodging our calls and buying time and only giving half solutions. The latest solution was a mismatched repair where the stairs dont match the rest of our flooring. The stairs were installed 3 weeks ago and already 2 steps have come apart, with the nosing starting to peel off other stairs. The stair nosing came with a reinforcement track, the installer threw that out. Unbelievably unprofessional, not a company you want to do business with. We called them 4 days ago, they did not take our complaints seriously, until their inhouse person came by and confirmed the stairs were a disaster. They have now admitted fault, but cant provide us a timely solution, they just keep buying time.",

            "review_text": "We paid over $5,000 to have our hardwood floors sanded and 3 coats of Bona Traffic HD applied which was supposed to help protect our floor from scratches from our dogs.  14 months later, the floor is horribly scratched already.  It has also changed colors under a kitchen carpet. I emailed the company advising them of the challenges we have had  together with pictures, and they said that the warranty had expired after one year.  I let them know that we had delayed coming to them as I wanted to wait until a lengthy renovation was completed.  I tried making the case that the damage that was evident in the pictures had obviously developed over the past 14 months instead of over the last two months.  I suspect they only applied one coat of protection instead of the three.  Unfortunately, no subsequent response from the company.  I sent another email asking that this be escalated to a manager.  Again no response.  Very very disappointed.",

            "review_text": "I had the worst of luck with this company. I don t blame them with any malice. I think they ve been professional, but that doesn t change the fact my experience was... bad. I was asking them to renovate a carpet on behalf of a client in Burnaby (this was for an apartment with 2 small bedrooms) and I had a good first impressions. The salesman was friendly, I liked their carpet selection and I do like the job their installer did and the final result. To be clear, this company does good work. The carpet itself is beautiful. So I don t think they are normally incompetent like this. However, the salesman I had ... well I think he was a fine guy and he had good carpet recommendations. The issue was he messed up. First of all, he forgot to account the long weekend messing up carpet deliveries which pushed the project back. That... was okay since he let me know ASAP and got the carpet to the installer. So I ve forgiven him for that. The main reason for my poor review is the fact he grossly miscalculated the amount of carpet needed. He gave us a quote for 2000 cad which was around what the other companies in the area offered. However, we needed 54 yards, he estimated 34. This meant that the project needed an additional 1170 Canadian, bringing up the project to 3170 cad. The company did give me a discount of 170 dollars, which was appreciated, but this sudden extra 1000 dollar cost is not welcome. I understand the company s position, but this was a hell of a mistake. We honestly would not have chosen this company if the actual quote was presented upfront. Furthermore, we chose them with the understanding that two bedrooms would be completed... not one. Edit: After re-measuring and re-reading the original contract I realized that while there was an opportunity for me to actually catch the mistake. However, the fact that a professional and who came and measured the apartment and yet messed the estimate up that badly is still outrageous, and it doesn t change the fact that the initial quote was completely off by more than 50% of the cost. ADDITIONALLY, the contract says 2 bedrooms. The fact that they messed up how much carpet to order should not be up to me, but on the company representative who ordered the carpet and made the contract with the understanding that that amount of carpet was enough. However, I also realized that he contract itself had one huge issue in which it isnt actually clear about how much carpet was supposed to be installed. It listed a number of yards of carpet, which I originally thought referred to length of the roll. The issue is... yards to this company means yards squared.... which... is... just not clear.",
