The flavors were exquisite, and the presentation was top-notch. The staff was super friendly and made our night memorable. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Paris, and I will definitely be back on my next trip to the city. Thank you, Restaurant Firmine, for an unforgettable dining experience!",

The highlight of the evening was the food without a doubt, we opted for a ribeye steak cooked medium rare, grilled tiger prawn risotto, and mushroom ravioli.

It was close to our hotel and beautifully a block away from the Eiffel Tower so we we gave it a try and ended up coming back again before our vacation ended. Service was great, waiters are attentive, friendly and accommodating, and food came out fast every time even during busy dinner times. Everything I ate was delicious. I asked for the pizza to be made into a heart shape and they did it no prob. The pizza had the perfect sauce to cheese ratio, it was so good. Would return on my next trip.",

            "review_text": "I had the absolute pleasure of dining at Firmine, the charming Italian restaurant nestled within a short stroll from the iconic Eiffel Tower in Paris. From the moment I walked in, I knew this was going to be a memorable experience. Our server, Balvin, added a delightful touch to our evening. His warm and friendly demeanor made practicing my basic French an absolute joy. He was attentive, considerate, and a true gentleman throughout our meal. Now, lets talk about the food! We ordered the Diavola pizza, and it was nothing short of amazing. Having just arrived from Italy earlier in the day, we were pleasantly surprised that it measured up to the authentic Italian pizza we know and love. The ambiance at Firmine is simply enchanting. The music created the perfect backdrop, and the lighting set a romantic mood that made our dinner even more special. While its true that dining at Firmine may be a bit on the pricey side, its entirely understandable given its prime location near the Eiffel Tower. After all, real estate in such a prestigious area certainly comes at a premium. Lastly, I must debunk a common stereotype about Parisian restaurants. Contrary to the belief that they may have snooty staff, our experience at Firmine was the complete opposite. Balvin and the entire team were warm, welcoming, and genuinely interested in ensuring we had a fantastic dining experience. In summary, Firmine exceeded all expectations, earning a solid 5/5 rating. If you find yourself in Paris and crave a taste of Italy in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, dont hesitate to make a reservation at this hidden gem. You wont be disappointed!",

Spent about close to 200 Euros for 4 including alcoholic beverages. It was nice area and the staff was in top of their game. I definitely bookmarked this spot whenever I am in Paris again. Not sure why I only took photos of the onion soup, it was so good!",

I would highly recommend  The Regina , but you MUST have the pizza with goat cheese, honey, and arugula. I m sure if you make a stop here you won t be disappointed in the beverages. They were absolutely phenomenal. The interior was gorgeous as well. If it s in your range I d definitely put it on my list!",

I came with a friend and we did not book a table in advance, but they found a good table for us.  the beautiful girl the waitress was very kind and polite, communicated pleasantly, said compliments, made a very good mood that evening.  served quickly and extremely quickly our ordered dishes were ready, it was amazing.  I have not felt such a pleasant service for a long time.  We were very pleased and the food was very tasty.  I especially liked the without alcohol fresh fruit cocktail which was very nicely presented and tasty and a big glass,not every cafe have nice cocktails from fresh juice.its worth that money",
