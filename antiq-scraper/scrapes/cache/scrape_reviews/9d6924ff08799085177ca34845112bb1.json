I just walked in  early in the morning today on a (I know) busy Friday for them having one punctured tire to be repaired & for winter tire changeover  following seeing my tire concerns,  the staff told me that he will just organize the already scheduled work lineup at hand and assured me that by midday the work on my car will be done. By noon time; I picked up my car as the requested tire service was done. Kudos to Randy S. in charge of the shop and the crew who ve made it possible. Top-notch, quality service with integrity. More Power Big O Tire Kingsway Vancouver!",

After hearing this, Randy got me sorted out and back on the road in less time than it took me to inflate my flat and limp my truck to the shop. Besides being an awesome guy for many people in similar situations to mine (as you can read in other reviews), I trusted them to be my regular mechanic shop for all my vehicles when I was living in Vancouver.",

Plus the manager repetitively took his time to teach me not to look at the 360 degree surround view screen when parking. He gave me a life lesson saying that not relying on the parking assistance would make me a better person than I am now. I did not realized there is so much that I could improve in my life. I came to fix my tire but I never expected to get life-saving advice today. It was a great start of lovely Saturday. Everyone in Vancouver (even other province) must visit Kingsway Big O tire to get their tire job done. I am not paid to write this 5 Star review. It is my honest opinion. Highly recommend.",

They repaired the second hole and only charged me the $20 they would have had they repaired the second hole on the first visit. I thought this was fair and reasonable considering there was no way of knowing when the second screw punctured the tire. I would use them again for flat repair. They were courteous and honest.",

I was delusional enough to think I would only need one new tire. To Big O s credit they gently suggested that given my tires had done 50,000KM that I should replace both front tires. They got me checked in the same day. The change took less than an hour. During this time I got several calls to discuss changes. All positive. Great customer service.",

They had an emergency repair going on for my first appointment and couldnt get my job started and was not able to call me to let them know. But when I rolled in Steve gave me a sweet deal as compensation instead. And on my second appointment Randy honored that deal even though Steve wasnt there confirm it for me also he made sure to make me stick my new insurance sticker on my plate before driving off (so I dont get fined), if thats not above-and-beyond-customer service, I dont know what is.

            "review_text": "Needed a tire repair, they were quick fast and helpful and great customer service today.  My dad needed a tire repair last year and came to this location, he was quite pleased with their service. Which is why I came back. You wont be disappointed. While I was paying for tire repair, I was talking to the gentleman about our driver side window wondered if they fix that as well otherwise we were on our way to another mechanic, thankfully the gentlemen said why yes we do, lets take a look. The mechanic came back with actual part costs, options and he was also able to fix today. Again great place and people that work here, they give you straight forward answers not vague answers or options. Prior Ive called a few places and they couldnt give straight answers or costs or had time, I didnt feel comfortable going to those places or  trusting them. BUT This place Big Ol Tires made our day by being amazing, helpful, straightforward and most of all was able to help us with a reasonable cost as well. I will forsure go back if I need any repairs done or to buy tires from this place, hard to find places like this when you need emergency repairs done.",

Now I have pretty well zero dollars...and still need a spare..not knowing that if I left my back door open and not my front my alarm would go off. So the alarm starts going off and itwont lwt me start it with the dam butterknife Im using until I can afford a key. Im bawling at this point. Im so stressed. Im half a block from this shop though. So I try my luck and stroll over in tears. These gentleman and I regret notknowing thier names. Helped me get my car going so I can at least get around for a bit. Compassion goes such a long way in business and Im so greatful. Out of the kindness of their hearts they helped me in a tough time and when I asked how I could pay them back he told me not to worry. I would come here with any future issues. Thank you. Thank you so very much. I cannot express how grateful I am to this company. The one gentleman who stayed to helpandthe manager who gave the go ahead to do so. Awesome folks.",
