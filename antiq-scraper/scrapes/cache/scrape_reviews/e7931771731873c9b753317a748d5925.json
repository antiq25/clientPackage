            "review_text": "This is a great gym. The staff is very friendly and approachable if you have any questions and feedback on equipment etc. I would give this gym 4.5 stars only because they are missing a few key pieces of equipment but that s only if your the body builder kinda guy. But I did talk to them and they are planning on adding those pieces in the next couple years which is why I gave the 5 stars. One is the pendulum squat machine which is one of the best machines to add on your leg day to really focus on the quads better than any workout you can think of for the quads. The pendulum squat machine is very difficult to find in any gym so the fact that they re adding it is amazing. Another is a standing lateral raise machine, Some call it a Watson machine. Another is the standing T Bar Row, they do have the seated one, but it doesn t put you at the best angle but still workable. All in all a great gym if you can avoid the busy hours. Thank you Golds!!!",

Usually gyms are cash grabs where they oversell memberships and hope people dont show up but I really appreciated this gesture. Gym itself is usually great and not too busy during the weekdays.

Bel was such a patient, caring, and highly knowledgeable trainer.

The facility is always clean, machines are rarely down for any period of time and there s ample room between stations to navigate without fear of tripping over someone. The facility has a good mix of free weights and machines so there s always options if the bench or machine you wanted to use is occupied. If you live within a 30min drive, this gym is well worth the commute. Also, a 1-time parking pass fee for free parking on the west side in a secured facility is a bonus!",

Free passes for my friends and family and colleagues to try out. Staff is super nice and easy to get along with! They know all the good spots in town, social and fitness. Prices are fairly reasonable. Policy/protocol with Covid is consistent and overall, a clean gym. I cannot find dust anywhere. Mirrors are sparkling clean for those gym selfies! One of the cleanest green turf areas I have ever seen in a gym. Way to uphold the brand Golds Gym! Never been a member of any other gym.

In addition, Golds trainers have always set an example of safety when training their clients. Impressed! As an older personal trainer myself, I appreciate the extensive equipment at Golds.

Although inconvenient with the whole time slot thing I like that golds has frequent times that they go around to clean and disinfect all the gear. I really like that the gym is very inviting for people that want to practice Olympic weight lifting as the platform, bars and plates are all eleiko branded. I hope one day the gym will once again be 24/7 with the showers! but we all take it one step at a time. overall its a really nice experience training at golds and I recommend it :)",

Due to covid, I havent had a gym membership in 2 years, but I miss Gym Life so I decided to get back into yearly Gym membership. I browsed several other gyms before checking out Golds Gym. From my friends referral I got to check out Golds Gym free for a day.  Honestly, Golds Gym was the best out of all the other gyms I checked out. I really like how West Broadway Golds Gym has new well-maintained clean equipment and the gym itself is clean. The gym has enough space that I can find a quiet space for myself to stretch before working out. The West Broadway staff are friendly, welcoming, and always helpful. The General Manager Noz is super sweet and nice, and she really cares about all the members. Noz is the best! I recommend you check out Golds Gym, It is definitely the best in Vancouver!!!! I hope they open a Burnaby location in the near future!!",

They sanitize the facility between each cycle of members. They also provide you with a spray bottle/sanitary wipes. They are keeping everything very controlled and clean while going thru this pandemic. I m super impressed with the level of care from the staff, and legitimate interest in getting to know us as individuals when we joined. Special shout-out to Nicole for always greeting us with a warm and friendly smile, asking us about our day/workout, and making sure everything is taken care of. Same with Noz.

We went well above the hour and he still took the time to show me some exercises I could do at home when I told him I had lower back pain. After 2+ years of doing weights thanks to John I realize that I was doing most of them wrong and that was probably the cause of my lower back pain. I would 100% recommend him, he is not only extremely knowledgeable and helpful but he is really passionate about fitness and helping people :)",

However, I feel that this location has done a great job. Staff are friendly, welcoming and accessible at all times for any of your needs. They are responsive both in person, and over the phone to answer any questions or concerns that may arise. The gym is spotless; it is evident that this location values the advice of the Ministry of Health and goes above and beyond the current COVID-19 guidelines. The gym has done its best to institute policies and practices that ensure that every member has the opportunity to have a safe, effective workout. The current guidelines not only hold their staff accountable, but also other members, making it one of the places that I feel the safest in our current state. I will definitely be recommending this gym to my friends and family. The facility itself is top notch, but it is really the staff that make this place excellent. If youre looking for a new gym, look no further than here!",

The classes are fantastic with excellent, quality instruction.  Everything in the gym is high tech, yet even a low tech woman like me can manage to enjoy it with some guidance.  The free weights and machines are fantastic.... cardio equipment is the best I have ever seen and the assisted stretch area is amazing.  Its a wonderful family run business that has been anything but a cash grab from my experience.  Hopefully see you there for a workout :)",

            "review_text": "I ve been training with Raven for over a year now. The gym facilities are fantastic- Golds has everything you need to reach your goals including group classes when they re open. By far though, my PT Raven has had the biggest impact on my success. Not just for what she s taught me about form, new exercises tailored to my goals, and reaching fitness milestones along the way- but for the confidence I ve gained through the process. I ve had incredible physical results from the training, but more importantly was the change in my mindset. Raven taught me to set smaller achievable goals along the journey, find what drives me when I m motivated so I can lean into that when I m not, and that it s not perfection but progress and consistency that are key. Throughout my journey so far she s always been in my corner. More than that though, Raven also taught me to be there for myself.",

Theyve only recently allowed their members to enter without an appointed schedule which works better with my always fluctuating work hours. Enter when I want, exit when I want (although their busiest hours do have time restrictions. Thankfully that isnt a problem for me) But by far my most favourite thing is that it seems like they have an internal work joke, where the person at front has to go through a certain set of COVID 19 guideline questions (to ensure the safety of their customers) as quickly as possible. Auctioneer level speeds. Very impressive. But yeah, great variety of machines. Clean up after yourself. Maintain social distancing and youre happy as can be.",

I m no stranger to working out and I ve always been confident in my own ability to do it right, why would I need one? Mirthy has converted me. It s simple as that. I bought a package when i realized i wasn t really getting anywhere and if I was it was taking way too long. I chose him as my trainer because he is obviously invested in fitness (you have to see him to understand!). His knowledge, skill and drive have pushed me into working out the right way to get the results I want and need. He supports, re-focuses and guides. If you want results, he s your man. I ve never felt more alive.",

Gold s Gym West Broadway is beautiful. On top, their staff and management are top notch! The mass return of members to the gym post covid, as one can imagine is no small feat. Management has been so quick to respond and resolve with any issues experienced in the new process. I have never in all my years experienced such amazing member care as I have with Gold s west broadway. (Kudos to Naz and Kyle who have really gone above and beyond with any requests I have had! I know its not easy, but you guys sure make it look simple!)",

He was always responsive to text messages when I had questions and he was very accomadating to your personal schedule. Apart from all that I saw results with him in a month that I could never get by myself. Thanks again man for the training and all the precise and intricate techniques you taught me.",
