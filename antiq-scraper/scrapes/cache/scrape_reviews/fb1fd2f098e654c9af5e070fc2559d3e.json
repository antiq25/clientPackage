The older Asian man hasn t been that rude to me, but he s just really slow and seems kind of miserable. Haven t had any trouble with any of the other staff, but the evening people seem to sometimes take their lunch without someone to cover for them, and leave a sign up  will be back in 30 minutes . Not sure if she still works there but there was one young lady who was excellent with customers. White lady with brown hair. Super nice and super helpful when you had a problem. There were a couple times that I went in the next business day after 1 pm to get my package and it wasn t at the post office yet. I would recommend going 2 or 3 business days after receiving your door knocker, just to be sure.",
