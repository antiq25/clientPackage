We paid  8.50 for 1 liter of water (as an example  ) We ordered the bacon carbonara and pizza (can t remember which one),mojito and pornstar martini. Overall great experience, really cute decor and location. *you cannot see the Eiffel Tower from the restaurant, only the top",

After a long day of walking more than 20km around the city, this restaurant was the perfect way to end the day. We ordered a bottle of French wine (Cotes du Rhone), Planche de charcuterie et de fromages (cheese board with meat), tiramisu, and brule, and everything was amazing! The flavors were exquisite, and the presentation was top-notch. The staff was super friendly and made our night memorable. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Paris, and I will definitely be back on my next trip to the city. Thank you, Restaurant Firmine, for an unforgettable dining experience!",

Roasted chicken came with some kind of auju/gravy that my husband said was the bomb. Soooo good. Beware if you order the large size beer,  its very very large, like a viking would drink.    Our waiter, Yazid, was great. Came to the table when we needed him and not when we didnt. Timing was perfect. Amazing beautiful date night.",
