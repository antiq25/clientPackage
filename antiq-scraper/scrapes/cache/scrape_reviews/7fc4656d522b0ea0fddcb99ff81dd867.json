            "review_text": "Sun Sui Wah is a popular dim sum spot in  Vancouver, BC that has been frequented by @sethrogen & @davidchang. After eating here, it s easy to see why this place is so loved. It was probably one of the best dim sum meals I ve had outside of Asia @eatswithedith on IG Ordered: 1. Shrimp rice noodle roll 2. Beef rice noodle roll 3. Radish cake 4. Siu mai ( 5. Tofu skin roll ( 6. Steamed short ribs (     ) 7. Chicken feet (    ) 8. Sticky rice (   ) not pictured Every dish was so authentic and delicious, it brought me back to my travels in Hong Kong   I absolutely loved everything we ordered (maybe except the chicken feet but that s my personal preference  ). The stand out dish was the radish cake because the texture was perfection.. I usually order egg tarts & other sweet treats at the end but I was so full from the other dishes that I didn t have space for it :( Tips: -call in early in the morning to make a reservation, they pick up the phone! -portion sizes are largeee -get the sweet soy sauce as it adds so much flavor to the dishes -add hot sauce & Chinese mustard on the side, they are the perfect dipping sauces! -go with a group of friends so you can try everything Price: $120 CAD/meal for group of 3",

Then ushered back to the entrance to wait until food was brought back. The restaurant was fairly busy but definitely adjusted to accommodate for social distancing. Servers were wearing shields mostly. Overall quality is very good. Most items come in 4 which is nice as some restaurants will sometimes have items in 3 which makes it difficult to share. With the high turnover rate of food everything that was ordered was clearly newly made and fresh. Things that were expected to be crunchy was crunchy, nothing soggy.",

I usually go to the Richmond location but this time I stayed in Vancouver so had to check this one out.  It was a bit empty, but also a weekday.  They have a large screen TV just like the Richmond location.   Wife and I actually like the Richmond location layout better and we sort of made up our mind that the Richmond location was better until the food came.  Staff was friendly right as we were sitting down, but then got a bit slow until ordering. We got our standard order of king crab and this one was just a little over 9lb.  Kids dont eat seafood so we had to order them the sizzling beef which they loved.  The crab was cooked in two ways and we ordered the same styles as the other location for a true comparison.   Last time was 8lb, but this one extra lb made a huge difference in the legs.  We didnt get the fried rice as we could never finish with it.  Got a bottle of white wine as usual.   But its a bit expensive comparing to if you were to buy it at a store direct. The entire meal was most excellent and we couldnt finish the body, but also expected for the size.  We actually finished everything else.  Also gave the corn juice a try.  It was interesting, thats all Ill say about that.  Both style of the crab was cooked perfectly and seasoning did not take away the crab meat natural flavor.  This is now new spot for king crab when visiting for sure!",

He and his team were so easy to work with and accommodated all of our requests throughout the planning and execution of the 10-course dinner. Upon Wallace s recommendation, we also switched up a fish dish in the 10-course meal for two dishes of ling cod done two ways, and they were both very delicious! We were so impressed how all the vegetables were cooked to perfection in each dish as sometimes they can be too chewy or underdone. He also brought out an entire set of kid s dinnerwear for our toddler to be able to enjoy the dinner. Big thanks to Wallace and his team for all of their hard work and pleasant service! We d definitely plan another dinner here again in the future.",

I ate at Sun Sui Wah when the owner opened his restaurant just up the street at a smaller venue.  i then went to Richmond when he opened the restaurant there and finally now on this main street location. The dim sum is always great for lunch, they are very busy so reservations is a must.  If you do not like making reservation then earlier the better or expect a very long wait time. I love their duck in noodle soup for dim sum, their deep fried shrimp rolls, their dim sum menu is extensive so I recommend a good look through and I am sure you will find something you will enjoy. Their dinners are generally very expensive so be prepared for that.  However their quality of food for dinner is well worth it.",

I havent lived in Van for over 10 years now so having a get together with friends and their kids, we needed to both fill our food cravings and have a place large enough to seat so many. We were seated in a room with other small tables. Thank goodness so the kiddies could run around a bit, but hopefully it wasnt too bad of an experience for others there (were pretty sure there were a few dates that Saturday morning). The server was always pleasant, and was quick and attentive. Honestly, he probably made the experience a 5, as often, the service in Chinese restaurants are sub par from Western culture but almost expected. He was really ok it! And the food. Oh, man, the food. We over ordered, of course, but every single dish was just delicious. Dumplings were plump and full, came in a timely manner, fresh veggies....it was just a great experience for me coming back so I had to give them a 5. Recommend!",
