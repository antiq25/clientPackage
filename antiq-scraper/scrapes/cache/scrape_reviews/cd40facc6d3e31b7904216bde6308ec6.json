Very spacious, clean and well arranged, a lot of foods, treats, toys, clothes, accessories, and other stuffs for your pets. As far as I noticed, they cover dogs off course, cats, fish, birds, reptiles, and other small pets (like rabbits, hamster, guinea pigs, even rats and mice). Although I never used their service, but hard to miss that they also have grooming and training facilities. For the clothes, I found not too many choices, but for food and treats they have quite a lot options to choose. Installing their phone apps is worth it, where we can find promotion info, check stock availability, online shop, book appointment for services, etc. For Petsmart, keep up the good job!",

            "review_text": "As I waltzed into Pet Smart with my shopping list in hand, I couldnt help but feel a sense of excitement bubbling up within me. On my quest for 11 neon tetras, dog food, and other pet essentials, I was prepared for a whirlwind of an experience. And let me tell you, dear readers, Pet Smart did not disappoint! The moment I entered, I was greeted by a symphony of meows, barks, and the gentle swish of fish swimming in their tanks. Like a seasoned conductor, Pet Smart had orchestrated a harmonious blend of products and services to cater to a wide array of pets and pet parents alike. With my eyes set on the aquatic section, I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of fish on display. The neon tetras, in particular, caught my attention. They shimmered like tiny aquatic gems, boasting vibrant hues of red and blue. With the help of an attentive staff member, I handpicked 11 of these underwater dazzlers to take home to my own aquatic kingdom. Next on my list was dry and wet dog food, and Pet Smarts selection was nothing short of a canines dream buffet. From grain-free options to high-protein and even gourmet choices, the variety was extensive and tail-waggingly delightful. I managed to find the perfect balance of nutrition and flavor for my furry companion, leaving me feeling like a true doggy connoisseur. As for the other supplies, Pet Smart offered a plethora of options for both fish and dogs. From aquarium filters and heaters to leashes and chew toys, I found myself lost in a maze of pet care nirvana. The stores organization and knowledgeable staff made navigating through this treasure trove of pet supplies a breeze. In the end, my experience at Pet Smart was akin to a tango with my beloved pets - a dance of delightful discoveries and well-executed moves. With a cart filled to the brim with neon tetras, dog food, and other essentials, I couldnt help but feel grateful for this one-stop pet utopia. Pet Smart, you have truly outdone yourself, leaving this pet parent more than satisfied and ready for an encore. Bravo!",

We submitted a form to adopt one of these kittens, and a few days later someone called us to come in and pick her up. She was 15 weeks old and a happy squeaker. Our Cats, before they got spayed and neutered had a kitten together and raised it, so we were hoping they would adopt Miley as their own - and after less then 24 hours the new family has already bonded. Miley seems very happy here and in-between the cuddling she loves to run around and explore the place. Shes also very affectionate and loves to eat. We would recommend PetSmart if you are considering adopting a kitten.",

Across the street is Michaels craft store and Tim hortons. Theres also a sun given foods grocery store in the same parking lot. Thats actually the most challenging part of attending this store is the parking which can be quite busy. Otherwise the store is great because its so large and serves all types of pets from dogs and cats to small mammals, fish and reptiles as well. Of course they have food for all these types of animals which is great because we have a snake and are always looking for a local supplier. The store is always clean and not too busy period they have grooming services as well as dog training services. There is a had adoption centre at the front of the store. There seems to be enough staff that work here to provide a good customer experience overall. Value for money is what you would expect at a pet store and overall the experience is excellent. Definitely will come again.",
