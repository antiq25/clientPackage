I didn t have Canadian cash and was unable to get cash from all those ATM machine. Fortunately they also accept U.S dollars and made the process so easy. Price was reasonable. I only spent $6 for both washing and drying. They don t have seats inside and the store is kinda small, but their service is too notch.",

I get a family run business vibe, they are hard workers and they are always busy doing tons of drop off orders but I ve never had an issue with needing a machine when I come in, have never had to wait even at busy times. They run their business very efficiently and don t put up with shenanigans. Everything takes loonies or quarters, but they will give you change at the till. Largest washing machines are $7/load, and the dryers are very fast. Usually a big load will dry in 30 minutes and cost $2.50 ish.",

I took a picture. It lessens the time your clothes need to be in the dryer. Just that convenience alone is worth the $1/load cost. Its also supposed to help your clothes not get worn out so fast. After my clothes have been in the extractor for all of a few minutes, I only need to run them through the dryer for about 30 minutes and theyre totally dry. They have a variety of double loaders, triple loaders and Jumbo machines for the washers. The dryers are huge and easily take my three washers worth of clothes in one. The people running the place are very helpful. Theres plenty of tables for folding and baskets for transferring your clothing. They have a change machine and a vending machine for laundry supplies. They seem to be one of the locations doing washing for the one of the hospitals? as theyre always doing massive loads of whites or what look like regular issue surgical scrubs. They have a wash and fold service for people too busy to do their own.",

Each and every time, I am met with amazing customer service and have been satisfied with the quality of work every single time! To be frank, running a laundromat during a pandemic cant be an easy feat and the sweet people that run it work nearly every single day. Id love to see more of our neighbourhood supporting them and considering using their services. Bonus: There is parking in the back of the building.
