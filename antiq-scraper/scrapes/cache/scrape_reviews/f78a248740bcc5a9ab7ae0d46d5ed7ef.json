We were introduced whats create of taste is all about. Waiting is not that bad, especially when the have 8+ orders in line. As soon as I got my sandwich i was amazed on how great it looks!! Colleen, one of the staff assured as that were having a great time!! Few things that i wanted to point out that i believe will benefit them to give the best experience to their  customer can have. If theyre goal is to give the full dine in experience, they should not offer their wrapped plastic fork/knife. They should have stainless steel cutleries for their customers. The sandwiches are huge, as you are creating your own food, so when theyre serving the sandwiches, they should include the cutleries right away. Other than that, the food was amazing, and the hospitality was excellent. They went above and beyond by ensuring us (guests), will have the best McDonalds experience well ever have.",

            "review_text": "As far as McDonalds go, this is one of the best ive experience in a long time. It is Nov 13th 2016 in the afternoon. Its not terribly busy, theres 2 floors with the upstairs hosting one of the rare play places, and the service is on point. I walked in, saw the digital ordering kiosks. I love how amazingly powerful they are. Dont forget that you can tap on an order and hit Customize to go crazy with the most granular possible nit picky stuff you can think of.  Today the Build Your Taste burger builder was fully integrated and let me absolutely get the details I wanted. Once the order was complete it got me to pick up an elecronic device known as a Table Tracker, this allowed me to bring my kid upstairs to the play place with my number and pretty close after ordering two gentlemen came upstairs with my order on a wooden paddle, and my daughters happy meal carried separately and carefully. The men asked us if we wanted any condiments, to which we asked for ketchup to which they happily obliged. No restaurant, especially fast food, has evolved over time quite like McDonalds. I though McCafe was a pretty big deal when it came around but now McDonalds seems to be catering to thise who want real food, with real service one could experience at a standard family restaurant.  Except i dont have to wait 35 minutes to an hour gor my order to come about. I imagine it wont be like this all the time, in fact im pretty sure to expect just like what happened to FatBurger. Sure everyones enthusiastic now, give it a month and some change and well be back to old habbits. But for now, I will remember the excellent service and encourage it where I can.",
