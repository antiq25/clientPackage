Then I ordered the Salmon from the happy hour menu with cooked prawns on the side. Not the biggest fan of the sauce they used (I typically like my fish a bit more plain), but it was not poured heavily and soaked into the Salmon which I appreciated, was just a bit on top of the Salmon and on the bottom of the dish (as seen in the photo) . You are able to order a side of Salmon here as an addition to your meal which a different restaurant said was not possible. I like that the option is available here. Presentation was excellent and friendly staff members. Bathroom is a bit small. I would definitely come back!",

Presentation of the halibut cake was ok but it tastes fabulous. The tartar sauce was just right not too sweet to help compliment the savoury cake. The seafood hot pot has a tad of spiciness to it and gave it an extra kick. The seafood chowder and seafood linguine from the all day menu were also very palatable. The seafood chowder is also slightly spicy which I thoroughly enjoyed but it might not be for everyone, especially those who do not enjoy spicy food. Only the cheesecake dessert from the dine out menu was a let down. Cheesecake itself is already quite heavy and combining with a thick chocolate fudge topping is over the top. *Been back here a few times already. We would go to adventure with kids and come over for lunch. Kid friendly restaurant with family washroom. Hailbut fish and chips is one of our favourites. The kids love the chicken steps and cod bites.",

We managed to find Vancouver Fish Company at a lunchtime lull- lucky us! First, there were perfect refreshments for such a hot day, like the Pear-ple Rain, with Empress gin, pear, elderberry, and bubbly. The best riff on a French 75 ever! My favorite was the Jeffrey, though, which was kind of like an extra juicy Pimms cup and I had several to verify that it was indeed my favorite. The Smokin Dobbs is a delicious mezcal Old Fashioned and definitely worth a try if you like mezcal. We started with a shared plate of the crab and shrimp fritters which were very nicely done without too much seasoning or breading to let the seafood really shine. Yum! I had scallops that came with polenta and kale, this amazing pancetta reduction, and topped with a little pecorino. I savored every delicious bite! My husbands salmon with Israeli couscous was equally well-prepared and disappeared quickly! Our waiter was super- he was funny and even though he was busy, he never seemed rushed or in a hurry and was always right there when we needed him, like magic.",

The Bison Tartare was delicious, especially with the mustard on the side. Fresh oysters were wonderful and FAT. I had the Salmon which was tasty as you might expect a salmon to be. My partner had the burger and it also tasted fine. Fries may have been better with an aioli rather than just ketchup. The service was exceptional. It seemed every table had their own server which I feel made it more personable rather than subtly noticing your server giving another table a different experience. Great choice in that strategy! It was noticed and appreciated. The white house wine is delicious. Like crisp apple. Loved it! And, location right on the pier to smell the water outside. Lovely decor and lighting. Also a bar counter seating section was available which was nice to see for those stopping for a quick drink. Thanks for the experience!!",

It was clearly for one person, and I confirmed this. If soup is served hot, it must be eaten first.  Make two trips to the table so the diner isnt sitting with 3 plates of food in front of them. (That said, our server was friendly and efficient.) Another in our party ordered the lobster and grilled cheese and pronounced it delicious. Another ordered the fish and chips. Excellent beer battered. You can get 1 or 2 fish. Get 2 if youre really hungry. We washed this all down with a refreshing pitcher of white sangria. And the view! Lovely, right on dock looking at the boats. Fun place.",

I like it soft, perhaps for others, it would be great.  Overall ambience was great especially sitting at the deck.  You should visit soon.",

The staff was very friendly and helped me choose something out of my wheelhouse.  I was torn between the scallops and the sablefish as Ive never tried that fish before but I was quite pleased with my order!!   Sourced locally off of one of the indigenous islands, Haida Gwaii, this fish was an absolute treat to eat.  And to top it off it was served on a wonderful display of, to put it in non foodie cuisine lingo, potato leek soup. For those not so adventurous, the halibut fish and chips that my wife ordered was some of the best Ive ever eaten as well as the cod bites that my 5 year old loved! The tartar sauce was the best tartar sauce Ive ever had to the point where I asked the waitress for the recipe, to which she was able to give me the ingredients and I still swear theres a hint of coconut somewhere in the recipe.   If you have the opportunity, dont hesitate to stop in.  It wasnt the least expensive meal but it was well worth the treat!",

Sitting out on the expansive deck with all of the sailboats in the harbor is the perfect setting to enjoy reconnecting with a friend. The heaters ensure that you wont get cold and being in the open space reduces the chances of Covid19. The oysters are perfectly shucked and served with lemon, vinaigrette and Tabasco. Ordering a dozen for two people is a must! Believe me they go down so easily. The Hangover Poutine was just the right size for one person and had the perfect mix of pan cooked gravy with cheese and meat! The service here was prompt,  knowledgeable and friendly. I highly recommend this place and look forward to coming back. If you agree with me, like this review.",

As soon as the food were served, we dove into it! We had the Seafood Linguini (not in photo as it was gone in a heartbeat), Salmon and Halibut Fish  n  Chips and the Salmon Club. It was a hot day and we were starving that we opted to dine inside rather than wait for a seating to be available on their patio. Nevertheless, the food was scrumptious!! Staff are friendly and seems to be enjoying what they do, fast service, and amazing experience. Will definitely be back here. Highly recommended when in Granville Island!",

We sat out on the patio with the sun setting - it was a great atmosphere with the twinkle lights etc. I would recommend to anyone visiting from out of town looking for some fresh and delicious seafood.",
