Their customer service was impeccable with courteous and attentive drivers. Vehicles were new, comfortable and spotless, ensuring we had a smooth and enjoyable experience. We would highly recommend Ritz Limousines to anyone looking for a limousine service!",

We couldnt have asked for a better experience all thanks to him, he was so helpful and patient with our large group, it made all the difference- Thank you Jay! I will definitely be using Ritz limousines again in the future, they are the best weve worked with! Thank you Ritz!!",

He was there early to pick us up, also very patient. The party bus we got was really nice and exactly what we needed. It fit the whole crew comfortably. The lights and sound system was the best. Cant beat rolling up to good ol nickleback lol. I very highly recommend this company from its booking staff to the Limo Driver, they are hands down the best in all areas. Thank you Ritz!",

No need to worry about missing a connection with that kind of promptness. We had the same driver for both trips, Rey, and he was courteous, friendly, and professional.

Without a real destination, I was unsure how the afternoon would go but Gary was a great driver, and kept us on time and on track to get the full use of our time. The weather was colder than expected, so we didnt take as many photos as planned, leaving us a little extra time to tour around. He chose a route that allowed us to see some things and keep the kids singing along, with opportunities to stop for more photos if we liked. Ritz sent plenty of Day Of communications to make sure we knew they were coming and when. Gary arrived ahead of schedule, and was very polite and accommodating, even as 7 teen girls screamed out their favourite lyrics at him while he tried to turn the car around. We felt very comfortable with him as a driver. He was polite and made sure to check with me before making any changes to plans. The limo was clean, the dispatch service was helpful, and the car arrived on time and did exactly what we needed. We would definitely use Ritz Limos again in the future!",

They then picked up my friends and took us to and from the wedding. The chauffeur waited for us and made sure that our things in the limo were safe. They were very knowledgeable of the area and were communicating to us which roads they were going to take. For any of you who are from out of town and here on a business/personal trip, I highly recommend Ritz Limousines. Comfortable, professional, and pays attention to the finest of details.",

Good communication from company on what the bus was like, including photos, and route it would take. As we were a bit early the driver made an impromptu stop for team to take some photos around sea wall which ended up being a highlight of the day. I would recommend this for team functions as it kept all together and was an excellent bonding experience.  Inside was appropriate as well for age group: clean, spacious with great sound system for team to play music. Price wise was very reasonable for size of vehicle and what we wanted to accomplish in the time we had to do it in.  Thank you",

            "review_text": "New Client and First Time Experience: I spoke with Sam basically throughout the entire process for my event. His customer relationship skills are top notch and I really appreciated the one on one customer feel you provided for me. I myself have worked customer service for years and its always great to chat with someone who has the same kind of attitude. It 100% seals the deal. I was so impressed with how we worked out plans for my transportation on the phone call, that before I had even had my event, or seen our ride, I was already bragging about this company lol Great Job. Finally our bus arrives and its a gorgeous, white, 30 passenger limo bus, absolutely blown away and so were all my guests! Two fantastic guys greeted us and welcomed my crew aboard the boat with again flawless customer service relationship skills. It was a beautiful bus inside and out. You guys killed it from beginning to end and I will be back(Even though I told Sam this was my last limo bus before 30) with more events in the near future! Thank-you so much for an absolutely fantastic experience.",

            "review_text": "If I can give them 6 stars I would. We had multiple cars booked; 2 busses and a stretch. I was quoted a price that was about the average quote I was getting, but what got me was when I was asked to come view the vehicles. No other company asked me to have a look. So I started to request to see the vehicles from a few companys I had gotten quotes from. 2 companys said no and 3 others allowed me to view. By far Ritz was honest about the seating capacity and size of the busses, the stretch SUV was the same. The day of service we got a phone call from the chauffeurs which was nice. All three vehicles were stocked with ice and water which was nice for a extremely hot day. The chauffeur I was with did a fantastic job; professional, polite, and courteous. For my future events I will book with RITZ again and definitely recommend them for anyone looking for good rate, great cars, and service.",

I have used a couple other companies before. Even flagged down limos from downtown like taxis with bad experiences. Ritz are the only people that I trust now to drive me around. If you are looking for professional, friendly and quality service then look no further. I highly highly recommend them for all limousine services.",
