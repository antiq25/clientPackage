            "review_text": "Amazing food at very reasonable prices during happy hour lunch service. Staff were friendly and very attentive. Food came out very quick so kudos to the back of the house for keeping things moving during happy hour! We got lobster rolls, truffle fries, fish tacos, and 2 of each regular oyster and premium oyster. For drinks we ordered their red sangria (rotating basis presumably between red and white wines) and a non-alcoholic local hazy IPA. We arent big drinkers so wont go into detail, nevertheless they were both refreshing and tasty drinks that paired well with our food choices. The lobster roll was great, you can taste the freshness of the lobster meat itself. This was something we did not find in the lobsters weve personally had around Toronto. The dressing and small cuts of veggies did well to complement and complete the lobster roll. Truffle fries were well seasoned, being able to get hints of truffle (presumably from truffle oil) every other bite or so. The aioli paired well with the fries as well. Fish tacos were fresh, the flavor and texture of the coleslaw went well to balance out the grease of a fried fish fillet. I probably could have gone for another order but didnt want to risk a permanent food coma. One set of oysters tasted more of the ocean than the other. Going by what the wait staff pointed out as the regular vs premium, the latter had the more ocean-y briney taste. Not for everyone especially if you arent a fan of seafood, but if you dabble then these are definitely worth a try at a reasonable price. All in all, we were thoroughly impressed with all aspects of our visit. It is on our very short list of places wed definitely revisit on our next stop in Vancouver!",

            "review_text": "This place is in the top 3 of best oysters Ive ever had! And the #1 spot for the best uni (sea urchin) Ive ever eaten. Definitely a 5 star! Lets break down this joint. Great vibin atmosphere. We were seated exactly at our reservation time. Our server was nice, quick, and knowledgeable on the menu. She mentioned the uni was firm and that made me go for it (Ive had some bad experiences with this delicacy). It was delicious. Ordered many different dishes - Sun Seeker, Sweet Select, and Kumamoto oysters were all delicious and fresh. One of them were very meaty. The horseradish is freshly grated. Lobster poutine was packed with lobster but pretty meh overall. Crab cake was a bit dry. 6pc scallop was seared to perfection. The tuna tartare was a bit salty, but still tasted good. The octopus was amazing and tender. And of course as mentioned earlier, the uni was the best and most fresh Ive ever had. The wife says they make an amazing espresso martini. Definitely get a reservation as this spot was packed on a Monday night. They have fresh oysters that you can take home if you like to shuck (who doesnt like to shuck)? When I visit Vancouver again, I will definitely be stopping by.",

Once seated, the owner personally explains the menu and introduces the daily specials. We ordered fresh oysters and premium oysters, as well as the owners recommended daily special - octopus salad for 26 CAD. Additionally, we ordered a tuna tartare. The oysters are exceptionally fresh, with no fishy taste whatsoever. The octopus salad is wonderfully crisp and pairs well with beer. The tuna tartare is a delightful appetizer; the tuna is very fresh, complemented by cucumbers and avocado, providing a refreshing and slightly aromatic flavor. Served with crispy wontons, its both crispy and sweet. In summary, its a fantastic choice for seafood lovers to try",

In addition to the great variety of oysters, they also had sablefish collar in the menu, and OMG was it amazing!  We also had the scallops with pork belly which came highly recommended by the staff and didnt disappoint.  Its hard to decide what is best on the menu because everything is!   This was by far my favorite restaurant in Vancouver.",

            "review_text": "We enjoy this so much that we actually came twice within the 3-day period we were in Vancouver! Such a warm and relaxed place, with great staff and fantastic seafood!  The lobster bisque was outstanding with a generous amount of lobster. The seafood boil was not overly salty and again was wonderfully generous with the best seafood. Just the right amount of kick in the Cajun seasoning so it didnt overpower the seafood. We even got grilled sourdough bread to soak up the sauce because we couldnt let it go down a drain. We demolished the cornbread which was probably the best Ive had because it had additional flavours that gave it more depth and made it less cake-like. If you like pork belly, the scallops and pork belly were a nice modern twist on bacon wrapped scallops and the sauces and vegetables added a refreshing element. Oh and a great assortment of oysters as well! We left stuffed and super happy with our choices!",

We came here for the dine-out experience and had a delicious meal. Each of the appetizer, main, and desert selections was very tasty. The seafood was fresh, the oysters had a nice fresh taste, even the lettuce was fresh and crisp which is more difficult during January. Also a big surprise was the size of each portion. Usually during the dine-out events, the serving portions are more like for a tasting menu. The portions they served were large, probably their normal serving size.

Their fanny bay oysters were fresh, meaty and tasty!! Were big fans of East coast oysters but the fanny bay ones changed our minds. We ordered a few oysters as we were there during happy hour and they came within a reasonable amount of time. They also had a special on uni (sea urchin) while we were there so we had to order some - they were delicious. We also ordered their crab cakes and tuna tartare appetizers - so so good. My boyfriend loved the tuna tartare. The place was busy and the service was excellent. If youre looking for some good seafood in downtown Vancouver, I highly recommend you try Fanny Bay!",

Server said it was okay and brought her a plate and silverware to eat it. Chef came out of the kitchen 10 minutes later and scolded us saying he would let it slide. Uncool since we asked permission ahead of time. Not going to let that guy downgrade the review and sort of like the fact that he only wants his food eaten in the establishment.",

No reservations during happy hour so if a larger group go near start ot make reservations later. Cajun seafood boil, crab corn bread, raw oyster and uni in pics. Get a side or bread for the crab boil as the broth is excellent and youll not want to waste it.

When we came in, we noticed just how busy it was inside, but the seafood decor was a great touch. We were promptly greeted and seated. We were pretty hungry, so we ordered a bunch of stuff: 2 dozen raw oysters (sweet select variety), 5 fish tacos, truffle fries, a lobster roll, caesar salad. We were impressed at how quick and attentive the servers were despite a full house. We sat beside the bar and it was a great show watching them shuck the oysters. All the food we ordered came within 3 minutes which was super impressive. The oysters were so incredibly fresh and the house toppings really complemented the flavors. The fish tacos and lobster roll were so delicious and satisfying too! I kind of wish the lobster roll filling was warm though... Aside from that, we had a fun experience, and all the staff were so friendly and great! We would definitely come back again.",

We only had 60 minutes to spare but drinks were on the table quick and food came rapidly as well. Oysters, chowders, mussels & clams and raw large clams were devoured by all, the biggest surprise being the lobster roll which the Easterners gave high marks because it is simple, tasty and the grilled soft bun delicious. Top marks to our server who got everything moving and was there when we needed him.",

Sable fish was cooked to perfection, buttery as hell while crispy on the outside, served with creamy mushroom and gnocchi, though we enjoyed another place garnish more. Service was quick, friendly and on point. Note: don t put in too big of an order at once for oysters, as you get 1 sauce whether if it s an order of 25 pieces or 6 pieces.",

Overall most things were very good and everything tastes super fresh. I would say the stand outs were the premium oysters (the day I went it was I believe Sandunes PEI), fish tacos and the mussels & clams. I thought the lobster roll was a bit light on the lobster and the collars needed a bit more sauce, but overall everything is very high quality The staff is also extremely nice, and the interior is very cool. This spot definitely gives you a taste of the PNW, and has many things to try. It is fun to go with friends and get a few things to share. I didn t try any of their entrees from their non-happy hour menu, but they sounded good too.",

The paella was visually striking with all its colours, and had tons of seafood! In terms of taste, I thought it was good, but became a bit greasy/heavy towards the end. The portion size was great too, we got a paella for 2 and split it between 3 people, and it was more than enough (although we each ordered some oysters as well). I really liked the grilled oysters as well, but my favourite part of the meal has to be the fish tacos. The fish was perfectly fried, and paired perfectly with the pickled onion and the mango aioli. These were by far the most delicious tacos Ive ever eaten, and I would come back just for them. Overall I thought the service was professional and the dining environment was nice as well. I thought the prices were reasonable for the quality of food, but I would probably consider this a 3 dollar sign restaurant, especially if you plan on ordering any oysters.",

Lobster was doused in buttery garlicky decadence    ciopinni had tons of seafood and wonderful grilled sourdough      geoduck and uni sashimi were transcendent (first time I ve ever seen sashimi sharing the same menu as Pacific Northwest dishes   Salad has a great anchovy flavour in the dressing   oysters tasted briny and very fresh    seared scallops and pork belly were a little on the sweet side but paired well with the bitter radicchio and roasted cauliflower Looking forward to including this restaurant as part of my yearly epic seafood dinner celebration with my friend!",

Its so insane that this place didnt get an actual michlin star. Those guys are dropping the ball. To those who might be scared to get raw oysters-- Im someone extremely sensitive to any contamination to the extent that the same oysters that gives my friends mild stomach discomfort would land me a fever for a week. I ate 1.5 dozen here and absolutely nothing happened. Can vouch with 300% confidence   I hope to be back soon!",

We also ordered other seafood dishes and wines. Oysters were reasonably priced with $3.50 each and extremely fresh. All the dishes were very delicious.

Ordered a round of drinks (I got the spicy Paloma, it had a delicious salt rim) and ordered our happy hour noms! The sun seeker oysters were super fresh and delicious with hot sauce. The tuna tartare was beautifully presented with 8 chips. We enjoyed the mixed mussels and clams in white wine broth. The bread was a little hard to cut and break up though  still delicious since we wanted to soak up the sauce. The brussel sprouts were perfectly seasoned, and the truffle fries were great as well.
