I found the description of their face mask to be promising more than what the product actually was. When I contacted them to try to find a win win solution without having to write a negative review, I found their customer service really disappointing.  To me if felt like they were more focused on trying to avoid responsibility for the issues rather than focusing on serving their customers. Their face mask was also on the more expensive end of the range.  If they had delivered well I would have had no problem paying that price, but it ended up just adding to my disappointment. I wish this company the best of luck in improving the experience of future customers.  We are all human and a work in progress after all. :)",

            "review_text": "**DID NOT RECEIVE REFUND UNTIL AFTER I FOLLOWED UP, OVER A MONTH AFTER ITEMS WERE DELIVERED BACK TO HERSCHEL** I ordered several things for Christmas. Upon arrival, I was very disappointed in 3 of the 5 items and returned. The return process was a hassle. I had to  request  a return, wait several days for a response, then pay return shipping. I did not anticipate having to pay return shipping although I acknowledge I did not check prior to ordering. I sent the items back 2/13/23, tracking shows they were received back to Herschel on 2/15/23. As of 3/19/23, over a month later, I d not heard a word from Herschel. No acknowledgement of receiving my return, no refund, nothing. I reached out to Herschel via email and immediately rec d a canned response email saying the company was very busy, it would take several days to hear back from them, and to consider their chat. I went to the chat and had to provide the order and return authorization number, and tracking number for the package that I paid to return. After proving that the package was signed for by someone named Gabby at Herschel, the refund was issued almost instantly. Of course the shipping was not included. There was no explanation of why my money had not been returned, and I AM POSITIVE MY MONEY WOULD  HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO ME IF I D NOT GONE TO HERSCHEL. At the end of the chat I asked why I hadn t received my refund without having to proactively reach out to the company? The response from Herschel chat was  No worries- the warehouse is really busy . No worries ?? Clearly on Herschel s end, but the chat person as a representative of Herschel certainly seemed tone deaf to what I was saying. It was a worry for me, that s why I ve been waiting for over a month. It s my money, and I worry about it! It s clear Herschel does not, so  no worries  I won t be ordering from your company again",

            "review_text": "I placed an order 2520751 and received the backpack yesterday and had my four year-old try it on. Unfortunately, the backpack is too big for her, both straps fell off the edge of her shoulders. Therefore, I called Herschel Supply Roberson and asked if I could bring the backpack back there for a return. The staff told me no because this backpack is the sale item. I am quite surprised and upset for this reason: When I purchased the backpack, a 30-day return policy was listed below. There was not a pop-up window that told me I can not return the sale item. Besides that, the reason I bought this backpack is not because of the sale, it is because my four year-old daughter loves the butterfly pattern. I checked the size for the current Herschel backpack I have at home for my six-year-old daughter. The measurement fits the dimension that is described for a mid-value backpack on the website. But they are actually different sizes, which I realized after I received the butterfly mid-value backpack. I didnt know there are so many different sizes apart from XL and mini. This is also my first time purchasing Herschel online. I am quite disappointed with online Herschel. I thought I would return this butterfly backpack and purchase another one online from Herschel. But I also learned today that heritage kid backpacks do not have inside laptop sleeves and a side packet for carrying a water bottle. By contrast, Indigo offered the Herschel backpacks which have all those features that I mentioned above. In the end, I had to purchase another Herschel backpack for my four-year-old daughter from Indigo where they also do not have a no sale item return policy and they have all the features that I am looking for for a kids backpack. I talked to the store and they asked me to call customer service where they never answer the phone and Llivechat staff named James did not respond me back after I tried to explain my order, Indeed, he just closed the livechat!!!!!!! I will never buy Herschel again! Moms, please not waste your time on a company that does not want to serve their customers! The $50 dollar backpack is a lesson for me to learn!!!! Hope my post can help someone at least.",

And now Im still waiting for the one that ordered. I cannot even cancel because they can not guaranteed. How can you do business like this This is so frustrating.
