            "review_text": "Came here for the Alaskan King Crab dinner with my family this week and it was amazing and super reasonably priced. They pre-order the crab once you confirm your reservation and show you the crab before bringing it into the kitchen to cook (it was alive and flailing). The crab was perfectly cooked into 4 dishes. The legs and claws were steamed with garlic, the body fried with salt/pepper/shallot/garlic, seafood fried rice was baked into the shell, and residual meat/juice was used to poach some yuchoy. Everything was perfectly cooked and tasted fresh and delicious. Service was amazing too. You have to drive through some shady areas of Vancouver, but definitely work the trip. Highly recommend and would go back in a heartbeat.",

Flavor was a bit in the salted side but thats most Cantonese Chinese food. The duck and chicken came out with crispy skin so that was bomb. Tea was strong and dark too, tieguanyin tea. TIP: If you come with large party, call ahead and order ahead so you dont have to wait for them to cook in the back.",

The food was EXCELLENT. The green beans with minced pork, the hot and sour soup and the fried squid - all excellent. Im going to be coming back again soon. The patrons also seem to know their regulars well and spend time laughing with them - which is nice to see. A really nice environment.

The owner, a very humble man, has become a good friend to our family and has always offered us to try new dishes and they NEVER disappoint. I had gone to Hong Kong and I m happy to say this is very comparable to the quality of food Hong Kong offers. Service is great and the staff are hardworking! Great place for large parties - It s always best to make reservations so you can secure your spot! Highly recommend Pelican!",

Dim sum is simple here, not too many creative/different dishes, just the good old favorites. Serving size isnt Western-Lake-size (also really enjoy that restaurant) but quite fair for the price. Service is good, tea is filled timely, never felt rushed to eat. I dont understand complaints about sequential food delivery; when the kitchen finishes the dish, the servers get it out ASAP. Would you really rather have a dish sit under a heat lamp while waiting for another dish to be completed? Ambience is just a typical Chinese restaurant. Chairs show wear and washroom needs a renovation but its not the worst...",

            "review_text": "Best Chinese food ever!! The waiters speak very little english. But they are still very accommodating. Based on food alone, this is the best place for chinese food. So tender, tasty, and perfect. I orderes the house special chow mein which was filled with big split prawns and white crab meat and large scallops. As well as the sweet and sour pork which was done perfectly and not chewy. As well as veggie mix that had my two year old asking for more broccoli. Absolutely love this place and definitely going back.",
