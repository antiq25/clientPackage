I have been looking for a patio set for a while but couldnt find anything I like. Once I saw this set , I fell in love and wanted it in my home right away . My car was too small to fit the big box , Yak was able to arrange fast shipping, and I was able to get it the next day . I was not sure about this set, and Yak gave me his honest opinion. The set is high quality  and very comfortable.  I love it.  Thank you, Yak and his team.  Highly recommend homedepot, especially this location.",

Thank you so much to Glenn from the bottom of our heart; Glenn was kind, patient, and helpful everytime my father came into the store to ask questions. It was challenging for my father to converse and speak proper English as English isnt his first language . Glenn didnt just give simple replies; he listened patiently, researched several times and wasnt willing to give up. Finally, he was able to find the exact one for us and gave my father all the information he needed. Thank you for your outstanding customer service Glenn, my father has never met someone as dedicated to customers as you are. You really made his day! I hope your hard work doesnt go unnoticed by the management and the company. Home Depot is lucky to have an employee like you. Thank you thank you thank you we really appreciate you.",

I LOVE great service! Feb 22/23 I had to make a return for a client who made an out of province purchase for her dad in Vancouver. I wasnt sure how well this would go. The client called customer service to explain the situation. The returns staff Fred and Mostafa were absolutely amazing, professional, and efficient. Lester helped me move the items from my car to the store. I was in and out of there in less than 15 minutes! I have always been a fan of Home Depot and their great service, but this really took things to another level. Makes me wonder why I/we would ever go anywhere else! Thanks guys you are the best!!",

Apart from the Warehouse size supplies for every DIY project under the sun, their online shopping usually offers either free delivery or free pick-up from the Store and offers an even wider range of products. The really neat thing is that unlike online only retail outlets, I can take any problematic item directly back to our closest Home Depot and theyll take it from there - no need to organize with Courier Services for any return items. I find this hybrid model of physical store + online shopping mix suits me very well, and Im happy to see more outlets doing the same - best of both worlds.",

I have been treated like a little dumb old lady whose biggest concern is the color scheme elsewhere. A big thank you to Brian for sharing all the info with us. For example: I seem to be shrinking and have to put my upper half inside the my current washer to take out the laundry, feet off the ground. I cant wait for my front loader! We feel confident that we got a fantastic deal. Please let Brian know how much we enjoyed the experience. Go Brian!! 5 out of 5 or 10 out of 10.",

We had ran into a problem when an item we bought was discovered to be faulty after the installation which makes things a bit complicated. Again Larry was extremely helpful and with Susana provided us with a solution that we greatly appreciated. Renovation can be a very stressful time for home owners and when you ran into problems it is even more difficult. Thats when the Home Depot stuff was a god sent to us with their caring approach and excellent service! Highly recommended!",

There is no shortage of customer service agents as well to provide good advice. They have a pickup facility for online orders as well. There is a large contractor area and lumber and building supplies section. Overall, if you are looking for a tool or part or decor for your house, this is the place to find it.  There is a McDonalds across the parking lot if you are feeling like needing a break and a Lordo and Staples across from that to get the rest of your supplies for the home.

We didnt know where to start and were overwhelmed. Then the assistant store manager, Mario Dedios connected me and my wife with the Pro Desk at Home Depot Richmond. Myron and Susanna helped us tremendously and made the process very pleasant, with flawless efforts. They went out of their way and beyond to accommodate our work schedules and even did overtime to help. We never experienced this much quality services at any Home Depot location in our lifetime (We are in our late 40s). Myron brought in many associates from different departments to provide us as accurate information as possible and also in a timely efficient manner as possible. The Pro Desk supervisor, Mark Wong, also gave us critical advice with purchase timing and delivery efficiency. Special thanks to Myron who oversaw all the packing process for days until the shipments left the store and didnt even rest on his day off but called us from home to make sure all the shipments arrived safe and sound. I would recommend Pro Desk Team at Home Depot Richmond to anyone who is planning in bigger projects than just regular minor DIY jobs. They are better than excellent, like they never sleep until you receive your orders. Thank you Pro Desk team!",

We provided a color code we saw on the paint manufacturer website, but it turned out to be the wrong shade after it was mixed (screen and real life doesnt match). Tiffany took the effort to try to fix that for us by manually calculating the difference in dye needed to match what we wanted instead of just telling us to buy another one. At that time we were satisfied with the new color so we bought it, but back under our home lighting we decided that the color still wasnt right so we went to a nearer Home Depot to get the correct shade (we had the actual swatches this time!). We told the paint associates there what we were trying to do and they told us it wouldnt work, and that Home Depot didnt carry that type of paint, which confused us. We called up Tiffany, and she did extra legwork to confirm for us that the paint type we originally got was correct and it would work. On top of that, she went above and beyond and called us back to tell us that a better quality primer was on sale, and put aside one can for us. She took time to explain things to us despite it being a very busy time at the store. She provided great customer service and made our visits to Richmond Home Depot very pleasant!",

We had to disassemble it ourselves with no instructions as it was the last model, but they assisted in every way possible by offering us tools. The customer service shown was just great during the whole process. I ended up buying another Gazebo as a gift as the whole transaction was super pleasant.  Andrea had literally 8 different customers at the same time along with staff questions,  but still managed to find time to check in on us which was greatly appreciated. Super awesome work guys!",
