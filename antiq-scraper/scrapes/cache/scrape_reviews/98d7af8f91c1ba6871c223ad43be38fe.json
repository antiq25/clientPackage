We have exclusively used Toshiba products which work particularly well with our windows/Mac blended environment. I had nothing but issues with my enterprise level HP MFP because it would not get along with MacOs. The Steelhead team offers fast and thorough tech support. Many things are diagnosed and dealt with by phone and failing that someone is always available for s site visit. The sales team is thoughtful and interested in delivering the best and most cost effective solution. We dont need to think about our printing, copying or scanning needs because Steelhead always has us covered.",

Let me tell you that if you want bad support, try companies like An.. or Col.... where you cant even get someone to answer the phone.  We switched to Steelhead about a year ago.  Average wait time to get someone to answer the phone - none.  (Im not even going to tell you what the other places were like - and another nameless equipment place asked me to do something illegal - seriously).  Steelhead is either able to remote in or walk us through a problem in about 10-15 minutes or they have someone onsite in about 4 hours, which is critical in tax time.  One time with one of the competitors we had to buy a small printer from Staples because they were going to be days to fix a problem.  Days.  In tax season.  Really!  My office manager has just told me were never switching because she can at least talk with a person at Steelhead.  They have been patient with us and we so appreciate that we arent a big customer, but they dont treat us like a small one.",
