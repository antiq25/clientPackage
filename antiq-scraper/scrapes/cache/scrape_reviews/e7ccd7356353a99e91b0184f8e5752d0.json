Yes, its simple tasks but a task / role that many overlook, perhaps including this company itself. As shes most likely just another sin number on a piece of paper to most. In truths, its because its a simple task and many consider it needy and the right / entitlement to neglect her and her position. As a senior manager myself, I see value in her role. The task itself becomes challenging as it is all about repitions day in day out. If everyone could do this, they already wouldve. The times I frequent this establishment while shes away or after her shift, the condiments etc are always EMPTY. Thank you for hiring her so us customer can constantly have straws, lids, condiments at our disposal. A little goes a long. Hope this translates / transpires into a wage increase for her. I will be acknowledging her that Ive left this review to have her be recognize. You store managers should do the same.",
