Being a realtor I got Nash Moving recommended to me by another realtor. Then I tried them on my clients first and my clients were extremely happy with their service. Then we hired guys for our own move. The guys are working  so hard and so fast and we didnt have a  scratch neither on our furniture nor on any walls. They gave us over 40 large packing bins for packing (returnable), so we didnt need to get any boxes.They wrapped everything and they were working like machines. Yet, their prices are more than reasonable based on quality of their job and the timing. I always recommend Nash Moving to my clients for moving and to my friends and other realtors as well. Next time we move, Nash Moving is our to go company. Way to go guys! You definitely changed the way this industry works! Have you heard of people tipping movers before? Neither did I :)) And we sure did! These guys do amazing job and fully deserve to be tipped. Thats how great they are! We recommend Nash Moving for your next move!",

Nash Moving handled it all with ease, even making a last minute schedule change with no complaint!  The took great care of our belongings, securely packed, wrapped, padded and protected everything, and put it all back together in our new home.  They came ahead of time and quoted me on the move, were very competitive with their pricing, and they charged EXACTLY what they quoted.

A friend of mine heard about their expertise and professionalism and mentioned them to me. Everything was shrink-wrapped and moved very carefully asking me where I wanted each piece upon arrival. One doesnt expect a mover to show personal kindness and thoughtfulness if you are having a particularly bad day. It was due to these unforeseen circumstances that I had to phone Nate and ask if he could possibly move more items on a day during which he had hoped to just relax. Nate and company are the best and most likeable movers I have ever used and Im now a senior! Nate is not only more than obliging he is compassionate too. It is perhaps this part of his personality that is as valuable as his moving expertise. I have never been in even a remotely similar personal situation before but Nates kindness made such a difference in my day. Thank you so very much Nate! Just in case any readers might think this is a marriage separation or problem within causing my grief please know that this was not the situation. I will be recommending Nash Moving Ltd. to everyone I know when they need a professional, reliable mover in every way! They do not come any better!",

From start to finish, they were both professional and friendly, and they showed great care with our possessions and about timing.

They were extremely professional and very compassionate, hard working and kind.  I needed help setting up a couple of items cause I lost my tool bit and they were so helpful.  They moved my items with care and protection and nothing got damaged.  They took extreme care in handling items that were delicate. I highly recommend Nash Moving and if I ever need to move again, I will only use them.  They are absolutely amazing.",

We loved the blue boxes they supplied, used their services to pack our most fragile kitchen and dining room items, and   were very pleased in all aspects of both moves. Nate was very accommodating when we found out on short notice that we could book an elevator for our new place. While we paid for our storage monthly, the second part of the move to our new place was included in our original quote to move us once into the condo directly. The flexibility and full service options were perfect for our situation. Highly recommended.",

But moving with NASH was the first time where we found ourselves ahead of schedule, drinking coffee (since we didnt need to help at all), and laughing. Seriously - the NASH team was having a good time and telling jokes, and my husband and I actually LAUGHED! Thats a huge testament to the difference with using NASH versus the other companies weve used in the past, where our stress levels were above maximum (and there was no sipping coffee or enjoying a good joke). I always recommend NASH and plan to never do another move without them. Theyre fun, fast, efficient and so strong that I dont have to worry about being helpful as a 52 person. They gave us moving containers in advance, disassembled all our furniture for us, and then reassembled it upon arrival. We were fully moved into our place and unpacked within a week, thanks to all the awesome help and perfect moving strategies. Thank you so much!!",

Few things I didnt like about the way they moved like not using dollys enough or not having a ramp on the truck to move things easier in and out of the truck and the owner would just brush anything i said off like its nothing. Shady owners.. The other co workers I did moves with were rude and lazy. Would try to make me do most of the stairs and try to do the bare minimum to get away from doing real work. Would not recommend anyone work for this company. Beware!",

Weve been in business for 10+ years and have had employees with us almost that long. They wouldnt stick with us if this was the case. Feel free to ask anyone of my movers what they think of the owners! 99% of them our our friends if not family at this point.",
