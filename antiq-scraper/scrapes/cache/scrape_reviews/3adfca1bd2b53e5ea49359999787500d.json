I ordered the veggie plate and my spouse ordered something with meat and we were both in awe of these dishes. So much food!!! It lasted us the sit down meal at the restaurant AND a late night snack at the hotel. Loved talking to the owner. He was so kind and hospitable to us. If we are ever in the area again, we will be back.",

I love a food culture that encourages eating with your fingers using some type of food as your main utensils and Injera fits the bill perfectly. I didnt do the ordering and am not totally sure what all we even got or what I was eating other than the bread but it was mostly all delicious. I think a favourite was a goat curry and a lentil dish. Also the chicken curry was unique and great",

You get a large pan that is covered with Injera. This is kind of like a spongy pancake. In reality it is a sourdough flatbread. They also give you a side basket of for eating. This is why there are no forks and knives. The flatbread soaks up the flavors of the toppings you put on it. This is what you are ordering off the menu. Once it is done, the owner and cook will pour your toppings onto the pan and you can eat. Taking parts of the flatbread you scoop up the food. Its a great experience and is good for a group. Left overs are difficult so dont get to crazy your first time. My personal favorite is the lamb. Please give it a try. Its a worthy experience for any westerner.",
