On my last visit to fill and pick up a refill, my prescription was not initially ready, and I was asked to wait aside. After more than a half hour and making eye contact with numerous assistants and pharmacists, I went to the counter to ask how much longer. It turns out that my prescription was indeed ready, but nobody informed me. Had I not approached the counter to ask, I would likely still be waiting. I understand that this is a  high volume  pharmacy, but there s no excuse to poor communication between staff.  I ll be transferring my refills to another pharmacy.",

Walked to the pharmacy, the staff said prescription was only partially filled, I paid the full amount and I have to come back to pick up the remainder next week. The staff are not friendly. Feels like I went to this pharmacy to get some ration. What kind of service is this? ... two weeks later..  came picked up the remaining medication.

I stress gentlemen here because the women pharmacists were frantically running around seemingly organising medication and incoming pick ups. If you hate your job or had a bad day, thats fine.
