The food was delicious huge portions, I even took some home. If you are celebrating your birthday, they give you a dessert and a Polaroid picture as a suvenir. The coctails are wonderful and everything is served in a super creative way! I will come back soon!!!",

I found they will serve the fresh washibi instead of the manufactured one!!! That s a great surprise!!! All the environment let you feel like you re in Japan. If you celebrate your anniversary or birthday, they will offer a complimentary pudding and sing a special song for you. It will be my number one if I want to enjoy the Japanese food. Definitely will let all my friends know and highly recommend if you want to try . Just in case, please remember to make your reservation.",

The Chicken Karaage and Garlic Edamame were some of my favorites. It was a bit hot in the section where you take your shoes off when we went but theyre great for special events (very entertaining birthday singing with a tamberine and free polaroid of everyone).",

When we arrived, we were sat at the patio table where it is bright and breeze, very comfy. I was impressed with how attentive staff were. Water jug gets fill whenever close to empty, they remembered which member has food allergy and let the person know as we order. For the great taste, good portion and amazing service, the price point is justified in my opinion. The birthday star got a birthday song, dessert and polaroid photo from the staff. Totally made the day. Thank you for making this visit so so special. Vegetarian options: There is menu Wheelchair accessibility: Not wheelchair friendly as the Restaurant is on second floor.",

            "review_text": "Some of the best vegan Japanese I ve had outside of Japan. Felt like an izakaya. Cozy, busy, stylish with artful dishes. The moment I arrived the staff were gracious. Seated in a spot out of the way along the counter so it was a bit calmer. I pre ordered the vegan bento box (you have to call ahead at least 24 hours so they can prepare the bento boxes). They went above and beyond to verify whether I had any food allergies and anyone who served me was aware of my request. They work incredibly well as a team. Ordered a jasmine tea which is in the form of a blooming tea...this was a nice surprise to receive most places only use dried flower. The vegan bento box is like a meticulous work of art. Each dish highlighted different ingredients and flavours true to the style of dish. It is served with rice and a rich almost creamy miso soup (best I ve ever had). Vegetarian options: Vegan bento box",

However, if I ever wanted to share a solid sushi meal with someone new in town or maybe even a business meal, I would definitely bring them here. I came here with my wife and kids and the service was excellent. The toro is some of the best I ve ever had. This may not be a place that I d come back to often simply due to affordability, however, If I ever want to celebrate and enjoy high quality sushi, I will come back for sure.",

The atmosphere was really nice and the staff were busy but still friendly. I had the deluxe seafood bowl which was not cheap but the ingredients and the quality of the overall food made it feel like it was worth the hefty price tag. Other food was generally delicious but if you want the best bang for your buck, I would suggest the katsu. The cocktails were also quite tasty. I had the yuzu flavoured drink with the yuzu infused ice cream which was perfect on the hot summer evening. I highly recommend this place for any occasion, but especially birthdays because it seemed like almost every other table was celebrating their birthday. I know this because the staff would come up and sing you a song with a nice dessert. Overall I had a great experience and would come again to try other menu items!",

The Uni Lunch Set for 2 was more than enough and we couldve realistically done without the Aburi but there were no regrets with the additional order. Without any doubts everything was delicious. What made our experience exceptional was our kind server, Momo (Peach). She provided an excellent recommendation when we couldnt decide on what to order and checked up on us regularly providing the next dish as well finished ours. She made us laugh and towards the  end of our meal she took a photo of us, giving us a copy to commemorate the occasion. Overall the food was amazing and the service was 5/5. Well definitely recommend the restaurant to our friends and family",

We actually liked those three meat dishes (steak on garlic rice, hamburg teishoku, and menchi-katsu) better than the sushi. They were all juicy and tasty, probably the best we had ever had in town. We left very full, happy, and satisfied. We look forward to coming back for more good surprises! Excellent service staff were all genuinely nice!",

The portion of kids food is more than enough although half of it was raw cabbage; wasnt too appealing for the kid. Kid-friendliness: High chair and booster seat available.

The udon was very flavorful and the beef melted in our mouths. The 9 appetizers were well coordinated to compliment each other. The miso soup was delicious too! After we finished our meal, the restaurant gave us a surprise. We got a complimentary dessert and the whole restaurant congratulated our anniversary. The waitresses also printed out an instax photo for us! Very nice experience.",

Man, we are so happy that happened because while we love Kingyo, Raisu is even better! We may have lost our reservation, but we still end up coming for lunch before our flight home. I sadly missed out on their Sho Ka Do Bento as it was already sold out. Next time! We ordered the Vegetarian Udon for the kids. Wowza! Im no vegetarian, but the broth is amazing and rich. Plus, the portion size is bigger than we expected. I would eat it myself! We ordered the Yuzu Tuna Tataki, the Grilled Hamachikama Teishoku, the Mushroom Agedashi, and the Snow Crab and Ikura Hitsumabushi. Each dish was above expectations and shocked us with amazing flavors and portion sizes. The Yuzu Tuna Tataki was so fresh! The Grilled Hamachikama Teishoku was huge! The fish was so buttery soft. The Snow Crab and Ikura Hitsumabushi were perfectly flavored. I cant believe their stone bowl was even better than my favorite stone bowl from Kingyo. Finally, the Mushroom Agedashi was my wifes choice, but I love it too. Every single dish we ordered hit it out of the park! For dessert, my wife ordered Coffee Jelly. She loved it as well. Not one single failure. It was an amazing meal, and we already made another reservation already. Kid-friendliness: My kids love the Vegetarian Udon",

Perhaps you wanna balance these flavors with a tide of umami, from the savoury and hearty vegetable udon.

There were so many dishes we wanted to try but we had already made reservation for bento boxes. On top of the bento boxes, we were also planning on ordering spicy lobster cream udon but the server insisted that it would be too much for us. So, we ended up just getting two Sho Ka Do Bento boxes, which turned out to be amazing and made us very full at the end of the meal (thanks to the server who stopped us from blowing up our stomach). At the end of the meal, we were also treated with a complimentary desert to celebrate my birthday and a Polaroid picture for us to take home and remember!

The udon was very tasty and flavorful with the lobster! They also brought out a complimentary dessert for the birthday people, and took a Polaroid picture of our table. We were very impressed with the flavors and how fresh the seafood was, and we ll definitely be coming back!",

I tried the house special sake which was on the first line of the sake menu, it was easy drinking, and kind of fruity taste. I loved it. I would recommend the robster cream udon, and chirsashi don. The cream uden was so flavorful, and super creamy. Also, the seafoods on the top of chirashi don were rich and fresh. For feedback, in my personal opinion, I really didnt enjoy the seaweed with tuna sashimi which came with in the bento box. I thought that the seaweek taste was pretty strong, so it kind of hid the flavor of tuna sashimi. Overall, the foods were so fresh and delicious. The servers there were nice and friendly. The atmosphere was cozy inside, and the tables outside is really nice, too.",

Maybe windy for some people. Omosaka for two, Umi not Good as I expected.umi mixed with toro are great, but The wagyu beef mixed with Umi it does not combine by well, I throw up afterwards. The udon is recommended. But the portions are small. The first time is the charm but for the second time, The surprise is gone. Overall some of the food that has sauce is overwhelming and off balance. Other than the sauce, the food quality except for Umi, are excellent. I will come again for The sashimi bowl.

If they are sold out of their specials, they should let people in line waiting know, and they should not be giving those menus out. We lucked out as no one bought their special bento that night - everyone feeding on Ootoro, so we got it instead. I highly highly recommend this path - extremely worth it in terms of quality of items, taste and portion. The meatball in this bento was so amazing - I literally cannot describe it other than pure concentrated beef flavour. Please, please try this out. The Truffle Uni shooter, equally amazing. I would go as far to say this quality and taste of food was than the $200pp omakases floating around town. All for $34. The chefs pressed sushi is not worth it and not that great. Pretty par - skip this. Agedashi Tofu was interesting - very tasty, good portions but didnt like the cornstarch thickened agedashi broth. Truffle Uni shooter is amazing, must have (dont share it!). Uni egg custard is tasty - worth trying but skippable. Snow crab on eggs is a definite skip - the bento contained more snow crab and didnt offer anything special. Takes AMEX, make sure you book as the lines are long. It was still very busy around 8pm, and they sell out of specials around this time.",

Then our Choice of carb was the lobster uni cream udon. All the food was good, but by the time we got to our carb dish we were pretty stuffed. My personal favourites out of all the dishes were the Sashimi, otoro aburi sushi, and the wagyu nigiri, then finishing with the matcha creme brulee cake.",

The lobster was conveniently peeled and placed outside of the shell, juicy and cooked to perfection. Udon noodles were handmade and had the perfect chewiness to them. Broth was creamy and flavourful. The plum wine sangria was refreshing, full of crunchy fresh fruit. Highlight of the meal was the wagyu nigiri-the touch of truffle salt really elevated the flavour profile of this dish. Decor and atmosphere was bright and aesthetically pleasing. The only area of improvement would be the speed of service. We were waiting quite a while to get our orders taken and bills at the end of the meal. We did notice the server appeared to have someone shadowing them, so leniency was given due to this. Otherwise, an overall pleasant experience! Highly recommend!",

I had their holiday menu for 2  It was a lot more food than I thought. Atmosphere is very cozy and loud with the music and energy from the staff. Loved the bar countertop experience! Original review: Went for the first time to celebrate my anniversary and loved it. Food was so fresh and super delicious. My favorite is the Milky Silky Mentaiko udon, wagyu and the uni   I was super excited for the otoro blue fin deluxe bowl, but found that a bit chewier than I expected (tendons? I dont know).

The uni (sea urchin) is fresh and amazing, anyone looking to try it for the first time this is the place to go! My first uni experience was at another restaurant and honestly it was terrible and ruined my perception of it, until I tried Raisu. It was amazing and I was completely blown away.

Not wheelchair friendly though. To get there you have to walk up the stairs. And if u want an balcony table seat you have to request for it when making a reservation.

Also, the waitress explained every seafood in the bowl, very professional. The presentation & the taste is very nice, no fishy smell. Of course, it s fresh too, no complaint. Highly recommend.
