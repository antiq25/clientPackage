They make the BEST vegan tenders I ve ever had! The crunchy exterior has popped quinoa (yum!) and the chick un interior is semi-moist.  All their dipping sauces are vegan too! I had the flaming mayo and chipotle sauces which were both heavenly with the tenders. The salad was fresh to order and tasted so refreshing On top of their savoury dishes, they offer vegan desserts like vegan cookies from Bonus bakery, vegan cakes, crepes, smoothies, ice coffees, and more! Looking forward to coming back soon",

I appreciated it having both lettuce and coleslaw I couldnt go without adding pickles either (a personal preference). The combination of the soft, toasted bun, fresh, crunchy toppings and firm patty were great. The skinny lemon pepper (at no extra cost) fries were cooked to my preference, not dry or overcooked, still soft in the middle. The server and chef was very nice to tell me about their menu and business. They packaged the food with care. This is their second location and theyve been open for about a year. I cant believe theyre open until 5am most days.",

The chick un tenders really stole the show though! I had it with chipotle sauce (recommended by V) and spicy mayo sauce. Don t let the simple decor and warm interior fool you, the food is worth checking out Will be back to try the burgers & sandwiches!!!",

The nuggets I ordered were amazing with good texture. the honey mustard, sweet Thai sauce and all sauces you can choose are cruelty free. My partner had the sweet Thai chicken wrap and it was good. We were impressed with the vegan crepe options as well. The oat smoothie I ordered, banana was delicious. Sadly they were out of the phish filet, already was planning to come back but excited to try that! Truly so nice going to a dessert and comfort food joint that s all cruelty free I wish I got pictures of the food and the main menu. always forget cause everything looked so delicious.",

In an unassuming spot along Fraser Street lives this local gem with an extensive menu that offers poke bowls, Japanese tapas, and most importantly - sushi burritos. It was my first time finding out about this place and I cant get over their sushi burritos... which costs only around $10. So reasonably priced with incredibly fresh ingredients. The perfect spot to go to for a quick, hearty lunch/dinner without breaking the bank. The portions are so generous. I couldnt even finish half my burrito in one sitting. Im stoked to come back to try the rest of their menu! Everything sounds so delicious and honestly, I had the hardest time trying to take my pick!",

The food is beyond delicious, the nuggets will literally blow you away, they are the best we ve tried anywhere, so worth the journey from wherever you are coming from!! Also the burgers are divine and they have really tasty kombuchas there as well. For all the non vegan folk they even have Cheesecake Factory desserts!! But seriously, everything we try is so good, 12/10! The owners are really delightful, super friendly on the phone and in person and answering all your questions, and that was what made my friend recommend them to me in the first place! Amazing local shop to support!",

Some portions are snack sized which is awesome because it allowed us to try multiple items. We ordered: - Egg Chashu Rice - It looked simple but was really delicious. The Chashu was melt in your mouth soft and full of flavour. The ramen egg was done to perfection and the sweet soy sauce tied it all together.  *Tip: Ask for extra sauce* - Simple Grilled Cheese - A rather simple grilled cheese, kind of like something I would make at home. Toast, butter, cheese, toasted. - Mini Poke Bowl - This was an interesting version of a poke bowl but came with only 1 pc of tuna and 1 pc of salmon. Maybe try the full size version? -Churro Donut - Looked unpromising but gosh it was like AH- MAZING!!! Like, knock my socks off amazing! You HAVE TO order this if youre a churro fan like me! - Iced Creamy Vanilla Coffee - Went nicely with the donut (: We ordered on their website and ate it at the beautiful Memorial Park- about a block away. Obviously, I am in love with this place and will definitely be returning real soon (like.. tomorrow? lol) to try out the other items all that the other 5 star ratings have been raving about! Please come support this local small business so we can always have this gem around!!!",

There s a ton of vegan options in Vancouver, but this is the only place that seems to have it all under one roof. AND they re open late. Just go and see for yourself.

A little bit difficult to grab with chopsticks but taste was amazing - Dalgona Coffee.... ok I ve been looking at this on the internet for awhile and wanted to try it and never really had time to make it at home. I bought from them (photo in the post) I asked for a large Dalgona Coffee with soy milk and  Dalgona rocks (caramel rocks)....holy guacamole it was delicious sweet but not extremely sweet and refreshing and creamy, for $5 I think it was definitely worth it. - Their Mole Pulled Pork Sandwhich... was delicious I mean a little sweet; a little spicy with lots of avocado inside....... This is truly a gem like Duffin Donuts, they sell everything you can think of, sushi, Mexican, fried chicken, coffees, etc. For a very reasonable price I ll be definitely trying other items in their menus  thinking to buy one of their burgers next time and I ll be re-ordering their Dalgona coffee again of course! Thank you I really hope you can stay on business regardless of everything that s going on right now. >> Order local and support local businesses like this one!",

I actually  like them better than McDs. They were very nicely crispy with excellent fluffy texture. 10/10 will order the largest size next time. Tiramisu was nice and light. The poutine got a bit soggy between packing and unboxing here at home, but made for decent morning after hash with my eggs. Old review for Simple Bites: My husband orders from here often not just because we live in the neighborhood, but because the food and service is great. The kitchen clearly takes a lot of care in their food preparation, and in developing delicious menu items. Highly recommend the portabello mushroom, calimare,  and the latest sushi burrito special option was delicious (smoked salmon and mango was combination that was new to me, and that I found delicious",

What a great little place! Yummy variety of food ranging from Japanese dishes and snacks to burgers, milk tea, skewers, salads, and more. Menu seems to change with different daily specials so it s fun to see some variety in what they serve. We ve tried many different dishes and everything tastes very fresh with basic but quality ingredients and prepared with care. The prices are also unbeatable for the quality! Also the delivery is in-house (by scooter!) so no need to depend on courier services like Uber Eats or Skip. The delivery driver is very nice and courteous too. Overall a great little place to order some yummy comfort food. Happy we discovered Simple Bites.",

Iced coffee is about $1 for a small size and Cappuccino Choco slush (or frappuccino) is about $3.50 theyre all tasty. They both serve food in mini and regular sizes. I had their Poke Bowl($10) it was big and filling. My friend D had Chicken Teriyaki Bowl it was tasty. A classmate brought tempura bowl to try and the Prawn Tempura was really good. He told me they use air fryer to make Tempura, and thats why it was tasty. Service was fast and friendly. It might be hard to find seats here sometimes so I recommend getting take-out. The name Simple Bites is very suitable for this place and their food is made with love.",
