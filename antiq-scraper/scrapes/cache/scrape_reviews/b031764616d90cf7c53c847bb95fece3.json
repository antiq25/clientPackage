Servings are pretty good and you get food value at affordable prices. Had their Ebiten and Mega Bowl and youll really get what you see on their menu. Downside would be, we ate inside the store and we were just about to start our day, we definitely smell like their food the whole day",

I always get the chicken teriyaki don with a poached egg and extra salad on the side. The chicken pieces are nice and sweet with just the right amount of fat and skin. Pre covid I would add pickled ginger on top. Ive had the katsu curry here a few times as well, also with a poached egg and pickled ginger. The curry has a nice spicy kick to it and the pork pieces are breaded and fried perfectly. It would make me so happy if they opened another location! Preferably closer to Burnaby!",

This place is authentic and is great for a quick, filling, delicious bite. Its currently offering some limited dine-in seating, and takeout is easy and well-packaged. Great prices for the size. As the name of the restaurant suggests, be sure to try their prawn tempura (trust me, its worth it!)",

Crispy cooked pork, rice was amazing, the pickled vegggies on the side was PERFECT pairing, and the portion was huge! Con: I wish I asked for curry sauce on the side because it was quite drenched. Do yourself a favour and just ask for sauce on side so you can add to your liking.",

The Yakiniku Beef is also a must-try, with tender slices of beef that are cooked to perfection. If youre in the mood for something simple and satisfying, the Plain Udon is a great choice. The noodles are cooked just right and the broth is deliciously savory. The portion sizes are generous, and the prices are reasonable for the quality of food you receive. Overall, EBI TEN is a great spot for a casual meal with friends or a quick lunch on-the-go. The service is friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is cozy and welcoming. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who loves Japanese cuisine.",

Best of all, a meal with a drink will only cost you around $14 including tax and tips. It beats any other fast-food restaurant in downtown Vancouver. Note: they are closed on Sundays.",
