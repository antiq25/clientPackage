My biggest mistake is ordering extra snacks and eateries during the birthday because the trays are super enough, and we couldnt even finish them (we were 8 persons). Very tasty and delightful, well cooked, and extremely various. Moreover, they customized me the trays to be a 100% vegeterian without extra cost. One day I will try their kushary",
