My daughter lives in Vancouver and I called on her behalf and the shop was able to help her out with same-day service. My daughter is a person with a disability, so her vehicle is very important to her as accessible transportation is not always available. The shop was very understanding, very responsive and very helpful. Would definitely go back!  Special thanks to Alex for the exceptional above and beyond service!",

I called in before bringing in my car(flat tire) and was told by the representative that they have the exact same tire on location and provided me the latest time/day it will be finished. That day came and when I called to check if my car is ready, turned out they do not have the tire and will have to be ordered and shipped from a different location. At this point, I was given another day/time when it will be completed. I received a call saying my car is finished, I came back and the car is not ready nor is the tire even on location. No one seems to be taking ownership of the 2 mistakes with the exception of Genesis. He took ownership of the issue and provided me with creative solutions to have the car ready at the time I needed it by. He was able to have my car ready within a very short time frame. We (consumers) need more reps like Genesis. Service: Tires",

The customer staff have always been helpful and courteous. Unlike other shops I had tried before, its nice to see that the staff here take the time to help you from start to finish rather than get interrupted every time someone comes to the counter for a quick question. Definitely recommend this auto shop for anyone who wants to make sure their vehicle is serviced properly.",

            "review_text": "Hello I d like to express the greatest gratitude to Johnny Ray Ritchie and his team of specialists for having brought my vehicle back to running condition and returned it to my property over the weekend.  The team was knowledgeable, transparent, and went the extra mile to order the necessary parts from out of country or did the repair if possible when parts are no longer available.  Despite me being only in town only during the month of Aug I was kept updated via email every step along the way and work continued long after I left for another 2 months. The vehicle involved is a 91 deVille which had sat idled for around 5 years with numerous issues.  It had a decomposed flat tire, dead battery, engine wouldn t start even when jumped, and inoperative windows.  It was towed in with an objective of bringing it back to road running condition. After initial diagnostic it was discovered the fuel tank was cracked and the fuel pump was non functional.  I was advised up front the potential of finding additional faults so the hidden costs may exceed the vehicle s worth such that I was able to make an informed decision and set the correct expectations. Since then the team went on to identify additional faults.  The AC compressor and power steering fluid line were replaced.  For the pulley system it was initially suspected that both the AC compressor and water pump pulleys were faulty.  I was expecting both to be replaced but the team took the extra time to confirm only the AC compressor pulley needed work.  For the windows switches, they investigated both buying original parts removed from other vehicles vs disassembling the mechanical switches to try repairing themselves.  They decided to try the latter to save costs for the parts. Worth mentioning is a vehicle like this wouldn t have been able to be serviced if it was brought into the dealership.  Not knowing when I d be back in the country next a scheduled reminder have been put on my profile so a quote will be sent to me a year from now for the vehicle to be towed back in for its next annual maintenance. As a customer I was not only impressed with the team doing what they needed to do to get the vehicle repaired given the scarcity of parts, I was also extremely pleased with the way Johnny managed it, and did what he could to keep the costs down. Regards, Titus Cheung",

As you mentioned, my team is in fact trained to recommend inspections and diagnostics be performed to isolate most of our customers concerns. This is to ensure the repairs are guaranteed, instead of wasting money on repairs that arent needed. It can definitely get expensive if you have multiple concerns, but we do our absolute best to keep things affordable for our customers. We have heard way too many horror stories of technicians replacing parts based on codes or uneducated guesses, and simply do not want to fall into that category. Standing behind our work is important to us, and we cannot do that if we dont encourage due diligence from the start. We appreciate both your feedback and business!

Our hours of operation for the Service Center have remained the same over the last few years. They are 7am to 7pm on weekdays, and 8am to 7pm on weekends. We have never claimed to be open until 10pm.  We have experienced issues with Google changing our hours in the past, so I apologize if this has caused you any inconvenience. I hope you understand and give us a chance to turn this into a positive experience/review. *Update* Thank you very much for your understanding. We truly appreciate your updated review, and if there is anything we can do for you, please do not hesitate to reach out to me personally. Sincerely, Johnny Ray Ritchie Operations Manager Canadian Tire Auto Service 604-707-2291",
