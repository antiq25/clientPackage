It s one of the BEST (if not the best) spot in town for chicken. Generous portions, great combination of flavors and very very friendly stuff. I freaking loved it! In terms of the actual restaurant, it s not anything extraordinary but more of like a grab and go place, with a few stands if you wanna dine in. Nothing wrong with it tho, will definitely visit again soon!",

            "review_text": "This fried chicken shack ruined other fried chicken for me forever!!!!! Yes it s hard to find parking, minimal seating, sometimes lengthy waits, expensive (compared to what though? It s Vancouver) but it s so worth it. The fried chicken is always juicy and perfecy seasoned, the skin is so crispy. The pickles are seasoned too and it s so good. If you just get chicken to go, they ll put it on bread to absorb the oil which is genius. The crinkle cut fries are delicious and I like to alternate between ketchup and DL sauce. Because of the price, this is more of a big scheduled treat than a convenient stop for me but I look forward to it!",

We got the OG Sando Combo (with in-house coleslaw & sauce), crispy chicken skin, french fries (with special sauce) side dishes, and handmade Lemonade. The chicken is juicy, tender, and very flavourful - the best chicken sandwich I have ever tasted. The fries have a special spice craveable to the palate.  Their in-house DL sauce is super yummy. Both the sandwich and fries are huge portions. Staffs are friendly, service is excellent. Limited indoor/outdoor seating space. Be ready for a long queue.   Street parking can be a challenge. Will definitely be back. Try Downlow Chicken Shack, you can t go wrong.",

Sandwich comes with their in-house coleslaw, sauce, and the bun tends to hold them pretty well along with the big chicken piece. I had the lemon pepper sandwich, which can be served with either a breast or leg meat, and it was not too hot. I tried the jerk chicken with the fries, and it was hot but very good, though. The size of the sandwich is good, and it would suggest getting the fries only if a couple of people are willing to share them. They have a small seating in the restaurant and outside, and I would suggest to try having the food over there as the food might suffer if you try to hold it for long (carry-out). Vegetarian options: Its a chicken shack, and the only vegetarian option is the fries.",

Id wager its the best fried chicken sandwich in Vancouver, and certainly the best Id ever had. Ive been going to DL for a long time and typically order the Jerk Chicken Sando. Its not a true Jamaican jerk style but its still off the charts amazing. Recommended sides are the coleslaw and the mac salad. They do unreal chicken thighs as well. I dont know where they get these chicken breasts/ thighs from but they are extremely juicy and tasty. Super high quality and Ive always been impressed with the passion these guys put into serving fried chicken. Im a huge fan, and will continue to hit this place up whenever I can.",

We also got the tenders and fries with some DL sauce and it was pretty good! The fries were pretty flavorful. Their original tenders are pretty good by themselves too. Would DEFINITELY come back to this place if I ever visit van again.",

Firstly, the chicken is crispy and juicy, perfectly fried. The pickles are different here, I usually hate pickles but I loved these, the flavor left a nice refreshing taste after the bite of fried chicken! The fries on the down low are super worth the upgrade they add pickles, pickled onion, coleslaw, sauce and chicken to the fries. Its super addicting. Come in hungry and order up and you wont be disappointed!",

            "review_text": "We finally decided to brave the line-up and check out Downlow Chicken Shack.  We had the two by four combo, the original and the rookie sando.  The fried chicken was very tender and the sauces and spices were very complimentary with the sandwich.  As a personal preference, next time, I will ask for half the amount of the spices because it was a bit too much flavour.  All in all, it was excellent food and service and definitely worth the wait.  We will be back!",

The line is normally always pretty long but it goes by pretty quickly. All the employees are very friendly and always have a smile on their face! The parking can be a bit difficult because it s only pay street parking. So give yourself time. Aswell it is easy to drive past as it s a bit hidden away on the corner. But If you love chicken I would highly recommend you check this place out !",

The fries were cooked perfectly and it s some of the best cornbread I ve ever had. I wish I grabbed two slices. I didn t like how the chicken came with pickles around it. I ll just be saying pickles on the side next time. If you like spicy and fried chicken this place is the bomb! Good beats to nod your head at through your meal too!

Suggestions for ordering: ask for light sauce as Ive gotten too much sauce both times Ive ordered and it causes the bun to get soggy almost immediately. Also skip the fries unless youre sharing as the chicken sandwich is very large and filling. Fries are pretty good, although not as good as waffle fries from Frying Pan.",

I will be visiting this place every other day until I have tried everything on their menu. A chicken lovers paradise. Tenders: I have had the extra hot and the hot and both are perfect. The skin is crispy and hot, the chicken more so. These dip offered balances the spice nicely and adds a fresh note to a very savory affair. I have had them twice, with crinkle fries. The fires could maybe do with some more seasoning but they are very crispy. OG sando and the jerk sando: OG was amazing, the chicken was tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned. The sauce used in the sandwich complemented the chicken very well. The chicken piece inside was a bit large for a sandwich that size making it difficult to manage it with one hand but that is just a personal preference. I did not like the Jerk Sando, the chicken was dry for my taste. It was nicely seasoned too but the chicken felt too dry and chewy making it an unpleasant experience. It is entirely possible that I got one bad sandwich and Jerk Sando is pretty good but I will only be able to confirm once I try it again.",

            "review_text": "The fried chicken is Crounchy! Yes Crounchy! Its like an elevated level of crunch! So damn good! Probably one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I have had. I make a point to always find a fried chicken spot or a fried chicken sandwich place and Im glad I found this one! Staff were nice, one of the guys running the line came up to each of the customers and asked how the food was and had a little chat with everyone which was a nice touch to the whole experience. We ordered the original fried chicken sandwich with the thunder heat and it was fantastic. I actually want to try the hotter options because the thunder was a nice spice but I always look for a little bit more heat. We also ordered the Cool Ranch dusted fried chicken sando and it was delicious. There is very minimal inside and outside sitting so just be aware of that. I didnt get a chance to snap a photo of the other options they provide but there is probably something for everyone. Including a few different sides to add to your fried chicken sando or just fried chicken. If you have 30 mins to an hour you should definitely take the time to check out this spot. Definitely hits the spot! If we come back to Vancouver we will definitely be returning!",

Hot is an understatement if you enjoy a spicy meal with a wide range of heat levels with a couple even off menu their so hot!!!!, With collaborating with so many other restaurants and brands within the city keeps their menu rank top above all.

This isnt necessary just it was a beautiful day and I was the first one there. When the line up started closer to opening I was behind a few people and a staff member noticed I was waiting and offered to put me at the front of the line.  I declined but it really shows how much they care about their business and customers.  If I listed all the things this place did right it go on forever. Downsides are the Hot wasnt spicy but I eat spicy foods so take that with a grain of salt.  I think for any real spice youll need to try Extra hot or side of milk Didnt try either this time though.  They didnt have any sweet tea prepared when they opened and their supplier shorted them on their lemonade but stuff like that happens.  Their mac salad is good but wished it was southern mac and cheese instead which would be perfect with hot chicken. Lotta places pop up and you hear about the hype and wonder if its worth the time and effort.  Often it is not worth it.  This isnt one of those places.   My commute there was an hour and it was worth it.",

After downing my red bull and a few cups of water I was able to cool down.   the air conditioner and my shirt being soaked in sweat from the lava stick i just ate helped as well.

The dry spice mix is quite heavy, but thats a good thing because it really gives it a flavourful kick.  I can honestly say that this is the best fried chicken Ive ever had in the lower mainland. I went on a soaking wet Tuesday afternoon at 2pm during the middle of the 2nd wave of Covid, and it was lined up.  I had to wait for about 6 orders ahead of me (thankfully they have ample room on their covered patio to wait for my order) but it was all worth it.  Definitely go here...now!  Stop thinking about it.  I said go!  What the hell, youre still waiting? Whats wrong with you?!",

I had bite of my kids mild and it was too spicy for me. So, if you have no/low spice tolerance I suggest going with the Classic, which has no spice.

Every morning I wake up and pray to the effigy of Doug Stephen in my living room    , and spend 10 minutes of meditation thinking of fries on the DownLow   . A must-try in Vancouver.",

            "review_text": "Without exaggeration, this place has one of the best fried chicken sandwiches Ive ever had. I tried the Original sando, and I have to say that it blew me away. The chicken is well-seasoned and delicious, spicy, super juicy, and once you get a bite with the toppings and the DL sauce, you might go back to buy another sandwich before you finish the one in your hand. As the chicken sandwich was the only item I purchased, I cant comment on the chicken pieces, tenders, or any of the sides. But, to be honest, get the chicken sandwich and youll be a very happy diner. They can have quite a long line-up, so make sure you go with a lot of time to spare if you go during busier hours. Cheers. Check out @foodpharaoh on Instagram for more food!",

Since there are multiple choices and we did not what to expect, we ordered the first item on the menue, called The Original The fried chicken was covered in a flavorful batter with what I would call  Southern spices, was placed in a burger style bun. The box was filled with first class French fries, also covered with flourverfull spices and last but not least, the food box contained a water bottle. All this for $20. Not cheap, but good. The only thing I would caution about, is the fact that this type of food should be eaten on the spot and should not be shipped for to long, because your bun and your fries will turn eventually soggy. Highly recommended.",
