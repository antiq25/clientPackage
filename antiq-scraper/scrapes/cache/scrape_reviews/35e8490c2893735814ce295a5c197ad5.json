The coconut rice was literally the best rice Ive ever eaten in my entire life, you should definitely pair it with your curries or even eat it alone",

Highly recommend the red chicken curry, chicken fried rice, coconut rice, garlic beef, cashew chicken, and the pad thai   Hands down the best Thai food in Vancouver",

I tried Cho Muang for the first time which was delicious!! The Tom Yum was certainly the best Tom Yum I have ever had  Both fried rice and Pad Thai was unique and scrumptious. And what more can I say about Coconut Curry  Each dish was less than 20 dollars with good amount of portions. Also I was very satisfied with the friendly, fast and efficient staff who were very accommodating and prompt to meet the customers  need. Our server was super attentive when taking our orders and answered our questions attentively. My experience in Sawasdee very memorable and satisfying. I cannot wait to go back as it has become my favorite Thai restaurant in Vancouver.",

The chicken curry was great but the beef was just a steak with a Thai dipping sauce - nothing I had ever seen in Thailand. The overall dining experience was still great and this meal didnt take away from the fact that this restaurant is consistently good.",

OH HAPPY FRIDAY! I ordered all of our favourites by phone - had to get all of them since we are not able to go often. Every bite of every dish was delectable - such a treat!! Favourites include Tom Kah Gai soup with prawns, Yellow Curry Chicken, Cashew Chicken, Pad Thai Woon Sen with Prawns and soy sauce, Satay Chicken and Spring Rolls. Will definitely make a point of visiting in person or take-out more often when we are in Vancouver! Parking in the area can be a challenge on a busy night but well worth it.",

Seated with in 10 mins, and staff are attentive and often to return to tables to see how your doing with your meal. I do recommend to space out your appetizers from your mains. The restaurant has a tropical vibe to it. Not much of a waiting area but you wont be waiting long. Come with a empty stomach. If you drive here, best to try finding side street parking,  Main st is a difficult parking location.",

Everything on the plate: pad thai both regular and tomatoe flavour, along with the garlic chicken and beef, crying tiger beef pieces, green beans, fried tofu and coconut rice and stuffed chicken. Although I would definitely get the curries next time especially the panaag, not the same without it. The pad Thai is savoury, and the garlic chicken and beef are the favourites. With the stuffed chicken being my least favourite. And all eaten with coconut rice adds so much different tastes to the whole meal along with the fried tofu and green beans being the lighter tastes. A rush of flavours will come at you. Although be ready to be paying a heft sum if you want a great meal like this. And be careful to add up the bill amongst yourselfs since we had problems last time and ended up over paying. Still great place. And a must try if you havent been.",

We werent even an hour;  food came out so incredibly fast we were happily shocked and it was soo fresh. Tom Kah Soup with chicken is my go to everywhere & its a healthy and delicious comfort food/ having been first time here I was so satisfied with the flavour and the cool mushrooms ... theyre called straw mushrooms. They resemble olives but are mushrooms.(never had those mushrooms but love them) The #67 I believe it was and I cant remember but it was a seafood dish.  Soo fresh & the popular pad thai the server suggested was fantastic. It wasnt the red one but the other dish. Just ask for the most popular pad thai.. anyways!  We ate and left before 6:30 & continued on our road trip.    My husband would be thrilled so Im going to try and take him here as soon as we can.  The baby in belly loved the dishes to hehe.",

This place is usually known as busy so be prepared to wait or make a reservation. You can also order take out I believe. We got lucky and were seated right away for 2. Knowing what we wanted, we were able to order right away as they checked on us after refilling our water. Our food came out within 8 minutes and we were eating right away! We got the Pad Thai w/ Tamarind Sauce, Sawasdee Fried Rice, and the Yellow Chicken Curry. Everything we got was full of flavor, juiciness and heat. Enjoyed all that we ordered and will come back for more. Also, the waters on our table were constantly filled. They are slightly more in the pricier side is the only negative thing i can say.",

Crying tiger beef is also one of our faves, you can always request to adjust the spice level as needed.  Make sure to call ahead for a reservation, this place gets super busy.",

We ordered the chicken satay, sweet and sour deep fried fish, and chicken stir fry and all was absolutely fantastic! Rice is served separate, which we actually appreciated. All in all - the two of us ordered, ate home made tasting Thai food, and paid the bill within 30 minutes. Highly recommend!",

We have eaten there twice and the food was extremely delicious, huge portions and reasonable priced... in fact we thought it was some ways cheaper than many other restaurants. They have plenty of options for vegetarians and not one dish has disappointed so far, although I thought their peanut sauce was a little too sweet. But the service is very good and quick . and by that I mean REALLY QUICK!! You order and the food comes to you in less than 10mins, but I am not sure if that was because of the items we chose to order. In fact we even got some ideas to cook Thai food at home from their menu like the spinach and tofu in peanut sauce. The ambience is also good; I would go there especially in the summer because they have skylight over the seating area in the front that I think would be a great delight to eat under. Too bad they are not open for lunch on weekends but I guess that s their way to show that they care for the staff as much as they do for the customers and give them a break weekend mornings. Very impressed overall  I would recommend this place to everyone that loves Thai food.",

This is my favourite restaurant in the entire world and I recommend anyone in BC who enjoys delicious Thai food to make the trek to Sawasdee, you deserve it. :)",

Usually I m lukewarm about Pad Thai but the dish here is just on another level from what I ve ever had. The menu is expansive with lots of delicious-looking options. Green Curry was also amazing. Can t wait to go back and try some other things out on the menu!",
