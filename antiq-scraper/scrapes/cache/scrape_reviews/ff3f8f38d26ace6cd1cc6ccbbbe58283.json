I have done personal training with Vish - would recommend as you get to learn proper form, technique, have a workout plan. Plus with the personal training, there s a seperate room dedicated for it so you don t have to wait or worry about rush in the general gym faculties itself. The place has decent amount of parking as well including an underground. Overall would recommend this gym and it s personal training services.",

It doesn t matter whether you are looking for a convenient location, expansive training space over floors, ample parking-Gold s meets all of these criteria and more. What I especially find endearing are the super friendly staff who are personable and help create a warm and trusting atmosphere. In fact, Gold s Gym Langley has had a handful of amazing   friendly, personable staff-superstars in my opinion like Cam, David, Dylan, Sophia, Jasmine and Jana!",

Tons of machines to choose from in addition to different private spaces to do your own work outs. The staff is hands down the best in the biz; Very polite and always in a good mood. My mornings are always positive thanks to Paiges smile and sense of humour. Ive also had the chance to take some personal training sessions in the last year with Natalie and I can see and feel a huge improvement in my overall look, stamina and mental heath since Ive started. Ive built some pretty solid friendships thanks to Golds. Im really happy I chose this gym 4yrs ago. I would highly recommend Golds Gym Langley to anyone looking to join or switch from another gym.",

The only gripe I have with this place is that the members are very bad at putting away their weights when they are done with them. This isnt the fault of the staff however and they usually try their best to clean up after the messy members.",

Its apparent its been around for a bit as the lockers had their fair share of wear but it was clean and had everything I needed. I arrived around 7:15am on a Saturday morning and had the lifting room to myself (which is nice to not have to wait for a rack). As it got closer to 8:30am, and I was in the main machine area, there were still benches available when the gym started getting busier. I never had to wait for a piece of equipment. Which for me is a big deal. Staff made it easy for a drop in, not an excessive amount of paperwork, just the basics. Well done Golds Gym Langley. When Im in town Ill be back.",

After explaining my issues, and without any hesitation she sprang into action, almost knocking the door off the hinges as she entered in an industrial hazmat suit. She came equipped with an arsenal of supplies and expeditiously eliminated any trace of the prior incident! Even after going above and beyond she still showed immense courtesy by giving me an air freshener for the trip home!! Overall amazing place and I would recommend it to any of my friends!",

I was very apprehensive at first because almost all gyms offer the same services and claim to be the number one gym. I must say that my experience with this gym was perfect. The trainers constantly motivated me and corrected my posture to achieve best results in less time. The group exercises were an awesome experience. With the right mix of movements I have improved upon my body fitness and strength as well. I wish to continue with them and recommend the gym to anyone.",

I have been in a lengthy process of evaluating whether or not to commit to this gym and have been looking at other options (Fit4Less and Steve Nash are the close ones). I want to dispel any notion that Golds is run even remotely similar to the manner it was before. I had the pleasure of being accommodated by Scott and also some of the upper-management. They explained to me that there was a shift in mind-set and management culture recently after the owners (I assume?) realised that not all staff were handling customers well. They went from  (judging by the comments) pressuring, money-focused sales people to kind, friendly, non-pressuring advisers. I was given a 3 day pass (free) and then he gave me and my wife space to workout! No pressuring, no number-crunching right off the bat. Just freedom to feel out the gym. When I decided to sign up the manager who assisted me took the time to walk-through all the terms, and actually prioritized me understanding everything over getting it over it, she took her time, was friendly and ensured I was okay and on board before moving forward with every section. The contract was reasonable, competitive (compared to similar gyms, not discount gyms), and easy to understand. The locker rooms have had a huge upgrade, have lounging areas with TV;s, nice wood finish lockers, UV Saunas, and the equipment upstairs is well setup and lots of new and expensive equipment as well as the good-old free weights. Apparently they are going 24/7 soon... And getting proper crash-plates and Olympic pads... Time will tell, but even if they dont, I am so pleased with my experience. I walked out of there feeling like I just made a great decision, not feeling like I was talked into something and dumped after the bill. Would recommend any one to seriously consider this place. Its a luxury gym (not a rec centre or discount gym like Fit4Less), so dont complain about the price and compare it to those (No one shops for a Ferrari and complains it doesnt have a Civics price tag). But Steve Nash has been spamming my emails and phone non-stop since I checked it out and I felt like I was just a commission in my sales guys eyes. Go check it out. Experience the new Golds for yourself. You wont be disappointed.",

The ladies at the front desk are very friendly, some have even remembered my name- which I appreciate! I started going to Golds when my son was 3 months old and they won me over because of their a AMAZING childminding team, and care room. All of the caregivers are extremely kind and accommodating and from day one my son warmed up them all and loves coming to the gym. Now he is 1.5 years and to this day he is very comfortable here! MOMS AND DADS IF YOURE LOOKING FOR A FACILITY THAT HAS GREAT CHILDMINDING SO YOU CAN WORK OUT WITH A PIECE OF MIND, THIS IS IT! As for the rest of the gym, I have found over the last year and a bit of being here the gym has improved and they keep looking for ways to improve, constant cleaning and maintenance, different classes etc.. Thank you so much Golds Langley for making me love the gym!",

We narrowed down my diet to remove any problem foods and lower calories. Tons of unique bodybuilding and athletic knowledge. Great old school trainer with a lot of knowledge.",

When I first began training with him, I was suffering from a torn ACL, and he helped me rehabilitate my knee, then reach my fitness goals and even surpass them. He s knowledgeable and patient, but knows when to be tough to get me to the next level. I highly recommend Marco for anyone looking to improve their fitness.",
