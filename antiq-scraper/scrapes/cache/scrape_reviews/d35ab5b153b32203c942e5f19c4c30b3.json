The food is tasty, and it will bring mouth watery flavours to you. A great sea food experience, the one you wont experience anywhere else. Food service at its best, servers are so welcoming, friendly and their recommendations are great. Beers, Lagers, Ale, wine, and speciality cocktails name it any, and they will have for you at the bar. The best oysters with the best standards. Perfectly shucked. Come and have a experience!",

Everyone loved the food - the only comment the even resembled criticism was the angry pasta could have been angrier (spicier) but so many dishes had us talking about them days later: baked oysters, sliders, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, seafood mac and cheese, the mocktails, cookies & ice cream  it was the highlight meal on our trip! The staff was beyond accommodating and everyone we interacted with was genuine, cheerful, and each an absolute delight! We were a group of 8 with small children and we wandered in without reservations and we were treated to a fantastic meal. I can t recommend this place enough!",

There s also a pool table that s free to play. During our visit we had caused some confusion as we left our table to go play pool. When we came back to our table, another guest was seated which led us to thinking that we had paid already. They had instead moved us to a table nearer to the pool table and we mistakenly left without paying. When we called back, after realizing a few hours later, to let them know of the situation and what we could do to transfer the missed payment, our waitress, Eva, had informed us that they had already taken care of it even though it was our fault. We will for sure come back to Hook to try out other things on their menu and to leave a generous tip!",

It s the kind of burger worthy of a top ten list. Brasserie L ecole or Veselkas type of good burger. Really good beer list as well. Really punched above its weight class.
