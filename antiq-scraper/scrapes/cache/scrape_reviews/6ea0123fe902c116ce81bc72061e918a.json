The staff were incredibly kind and lovely, and I really appreciated how much of an effort they put in to create a cozy dining experience. I sat at the bar and was well attended to, bartender & server all very warm and friendly. They consider the little things in both the service and food. Highly recommended and added to my favorite food list for a revisit.",

As it was my birthday the staff gave me a signed card and went out of the way to make the dinning experience world class. From unique shared menu for two that I highly recommended to cocktails that will knock your socks off. The McKenzie should be high on your list of restaurants to try in Vancouver and is 100% worthy of their first star. -Max",

            "review_text": "Dined solo to kick off my last week in Vancouver on this trip. Focusing on locally sourced ingredients, the solo menu is comprised 5 courses. At only $74, it s an incredible value. The menu has pun names which I absolutely adored; Sashimi Not, Zucc I am Your Father, Trout Krout Sprout, of Bison Men, and Le Big Mack. My favourite bites were the zucchini two ways, the trout (minus the brussels) and the King Salmon sashimi. The bison was very well cooked and the spinach was delicious but the potato was lacklustre. Along with the meal, the bar manager made me a beverage pairing which had cocktails and glasses of wine based on my preference. The final digestif had pickled spruce tips stuffed in an olive. There were a number of other dishes on the menu which caught my eye. I definitely will have to come back the next time I am in town.",

If you are a foodie this is a MUST TRY location. Best option is the, I WANT IT ALL option ($85/person). Its a 12 course tapas share option, of delicious pallet popping delights, where you get to try the entire Chefs Creations. Only catch is you need a minimum of 4 people to try this. So get your double date on and try this place. Youll thank me later.  CHEERS!!! PS- There is also a very creative signature cocktails menu if you so desire.",

Their  I want it all  menu is reasonably priced at $85 for 12 courses and all reasonably portioned that you d be full by the end of the meal. The service is excellent and the vibe is quite lively. The only thing I d note is that I d like the lights a tad brighter. If you are coming by vehicle you can come down Powell street after a left turn from Knight street. Park in front or on the next block, at $1 per hour. Definitely a must try if you are a local or visiting Vancouver for your first time. Make sure to book your reservations in advance (1 mth). Of all the courses I really liked the  chicken of the sea ,  Hal 9000 ,  lamb tartare ,  Pigs in a blanket , and  Rhubarbra streisand .",

The stand out dishes were the chicken of the sea and the pork dish. I also ordered a non alcoholic ginger beer for $5 which I thought was a great price for the taste . Overall I thought for the food and service, the price we paid was fair. I would definitely come back with 4 people to try the full tasting menu. Areas for improvement would be check the chairs/stools to make sure theyre level as mine was wobbly. Not a huge thing but its a small fix that I think would improve the experience. Also I would recommend Ubering as the area is unfortunately very sketchy. If you are going to walk, Id recommend parking in the neighborhood with houses more south and then walking.",

Similarly, the service was also chummy, like we knew each other and could joke around casually. They also knew their staff, introducing each plate perfectly. The space and washrooms were clean. Some things to know before you go. The area is not upscale, downtown Van. I wouldn t walk from my car to the restaurant in the dark by myself. (Maybe that s just me.) The building is old. I noticed that my table was on a slight slant. If you re with vegan friends, the restaurant will accommodate, which is amazing and not too common. And make reservations, if you can!",

As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by a charming staff, and our server even made the effort to address us in French, which truly added a special touch to our experience. However, the real star of the evening was the food. The dishes were simply exceptional, and it was evident that a lot of effort went into crafting the flavors and presentation. Every bite was a burst of flavors, and we were pleasantly surprised by the creativity of the dishes. Personally, Im not a big fan of desserts, but the plum choux with pistachio cream was simply divine. It was the perfect sweet touch to conclude this memorable feast. In summary, I wholeheartedly recommend this place. The restaurant offers an exceptional culinary experience, a pleasant atmosphere, and attentive service. If youre looking for a memorable gastronomic experience, look no further. This is a must-visit address.",

The location is in Vancouver s old Japantown, right across from Oppenheimer park, which at night isn t the best place to walk around, but the building has a ton of character and it is a nice hidden gem. The chef is creative and puts some bold flavours on the plate. Examples include a sea urchin pate with a hazelnut spread and charred onions to be scooped up with torn squid ink bread. Or, a  cabbage roll  with cabbage, pork, pork belly, and sweet breads on top of pomme puree. The cocktails were also delicious and they include some great local beers. Next up is the  I ll have it all , a menu for a table of 4 that includes all of their dishes.",

The first item, known as Chicken of the Sea was an extraordinary flavour bomb.  Sea urchin pate and squid ink brioche might be uncommon but they are part of a signature dish here that should not be missed. Next came a salad with uncommon radish varieties, pear chunks and lardo. Slow roasted salmon with miso beurre blanc and nori oil was so good, it will change the way I cook this fish at home. Duck breast met the same high standards but our Gods Flan dessert, while attractive, was less satisfying. People may hesitate to visit a restaurant in Vancouvers Powell Street neighbourhood but I am not aware of any problems experienced by diners during years of operation. Scout Magazine rates this as one of Vancouvers best 25 restaurants and were already planning to return with another couple to enjoy the I Want it All menu.",

Service staff friendly and knowledgeable of the dishes being served. We also ran behind and they were so good to still accommodate us without any attitude like some other restaurants would do. Each dish prepared to perfection. The #beefbaby left me wanting more and more. I m not major on sea urchin but their Chicken of the Sea was also phenomenal and paired beautifully with the squid ink brioche. The sear on the Arctic char was perfection and the Pork collar (in Collar by Your Name) was beyond tender. Loved the orange panna cotta which wasn t overly sweet and paired nicely with the citrus of the orange. Would highly recommend this restaurant and it s a definite  yes  for me .",

As a person who eats out a lot, I was surprised by how unique the combinations of food was and how I ve never tried a handful of these local ingredients. The chicken of the sea had the yummiest brioche I ve ever had (crunchy and buttery), along with the rich pate, which is balanced by pickled veggies. It really starts your meal with a bunch of flavour. I ve never had Uni in a pate form but the flavour came out nicely. Another highlight was the pork cheeks. Meat was cooked to fall off the bone, tender to touch and it was definitely the star of the show with sauces and fruit to enhance it. These are two dishes you must try! I will say the spices paired with the gourd and the sunchoked pasta are dishes that you may need to acquire a taste for and pronanly have never tried. They re different in a good way but not for everyone. Overall, great food, presentation was equally as good as service and this is a place worth checking out. I came for Dineout, but you can try their tasting menu or even order a la carte. Their cocktails are also delicious and worth a try!",

We got the Two of Us, but my boyfriend was allergic to seafood so they replaced some of the dishes. All of the food made us involuntarily go,  MMM! The Showstopper salad with housemade ricotta had the best ricotta I ve ever tasted. The pasta with duck confit had an explosion of flavour with each bite. The mezzaluna was our first time trying rutabaga, and we loved the bitter earthiness. The full belly was lamb belly stuffed with pork, and I m pretty sure was laced with some sort of black magic because it tasted supernatural. The eclair was light and slightly sweet, with beautiful tart strawberries and rhubarb. The wallflower was our favourite cocktail! Honestly, this place is a good time, and an amazing experience. We ended up paying $230 after all the food and drinks and tip. A bit steep, but SO worth it for a birthday/special occasion, or if you re just tryna treat yo self",

The only downsides for us were the neighborhood - it wasn t as bustling as I hoped so we didn t walk around like we had planned, and it was a little crowded inside, although that did lend to the vibrant atmosphere inside.  Overall, a super special place that I d love to visit again.",

Had the 5 person tasting menu and it was fantastic- each dish presented with unique and complex flavours that worked well together. Only let down was that dessert was a bit lacklustre relative to rest of the menu. Highlight was the halibut.",

            "review_text": "Summary: Very unique thoughtful dishes, great ambience, and amazing service to round out a memorable experience! Checked out Mackenzie Room to celebrate my birthday and was very happy with the decision! We tried the Dine OUt menu and opted to sub the Pork dish for the Sablefish as my partner is Pescatarian. Ambience: 5/5 - Cozy atmosphere with great furnishings - Felt very at home and made for a comfortable environment to enjoy the amazing food - Was a cooler night than usual in Vancouver and it got a bit chilly when patrons entered and left the restaurant. This is being really nitpicky though and I wouldnt say it took away from our experience - Music level was perfect and we didnt find that background noise level was too loud as mentioned in other reviews (it being a Monday evening could have been part of the reason) Service: 5/5 Went in on a Monday evening so it wasnt too busy. We were greeted very warmly and all the staff were very friendly and came across as genuine. All the food came out quickly and our plates were cleared promptly without making us feel rushed whatsoever Food: 5/5 While Im definitely partial to protein-heavy meat dishes, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the Sea Urchin (Chicken of the Sea) and Parsnip (Wesley Snips) dishes. Each dish was very well balanced, and the flavors were unique. That said, the standout dish for me was the Chicken of the Sea  because everything from the presentation and taste of the brioche bread, all the way to the texture of the hazelnut buttered sea urchin combo were incredibly well crafted. I already want to go back just for this dish! The Salmon (Sir Salmon Rushdie), Sablefish (Surf and Surf), and dessert (Quince of Darkness) were all delicious and the portion sizes were very reasonable too. The next most memorable item for me after the Chicken of the Sea would have to be the Russian Cigarette Paper in the dessert - never had anything like it and it was fantastic! I was on the hungrier side and ended up ordering the Lamb Tartare (Hello Clarice) dish for myself - gotta treat yourself, especially on your birthday right? The dish was fantastic (loved the strong acid flavours that came through). That dish definitely put me over the top, but I had no regrets! Im definitely planning a return visit with some friends to try the I want it All. Drinks: 5/5 My partner opted to try the wine pairings with the Dine Out menu. She was very happy with each pairing, though she did find one of the wines on the sweeter side. She also very much loved one of the South African dryer wines that was served with the Sablefish. I tried the Aggies Manhattan and thought it was very well balanced. It had the perfect amount of flavour while being spirit-forward. Ended up ordering a 2nd one as it was delicious! Overall Rating: 5/5 I had to write a review for our experience at Mackenzie Room as it made for a very memorable and DELICIOUS meal.  Ive been putting off writing my first review, but I HAD to write one for the Mackenzie Room after how great the whole experience was! Vegetarian options: Delicious vegetarian dishes, especially the parsnips! Parking: Street parking out front on Cordova. Not the nicest area",
