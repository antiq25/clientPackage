I enjoyed my Huaracha Pastor, however my partners Beef Machete was spicy and tasty. Definitely recommend the Machete. We heard the table next to ask about the Flan but they were sold out by 7pm, must have been good! Its a small operation so you have to wait a little for your food but its worth it and freshly cooked. The couple running it are so kind and lovely.",

The hot chocolate is amazing, and all the food on the menu is delicious and well portioned, I always leave feeling perfectly full, and the price is reasonable. The tres salsas  is probably my favourite but all the food I tried so far has been full of great flavours. Best authentic Mexican food in Vancouver. Vegetarian options: Great veggie options Parking: Parking can be difficult and also sorta sketchy around this area lock your doors don t leave anything in sight.",

            "review_text": "Really unique place in Vancouver focusing on pre-Hispanic Mexican food. Most of the menu items feature their homemade blue corn tortillas and theres a great selection of traditional cacao drinks (hot and iced) - stuff that I dont think you can find anywhere else in the city. So I was very curious to try, and decided to take my parents here while they were visiting because my dad requested Mexican food. Because this is not your typical Mexican food I wasnt sure if it would be what they had in mind, but it was a hit with all of us and my dad even said it might be the best Mexican food hes ever had. I got the chihatl to drink and the itacates de flor de calabaza for my meal. My first time trying chihatl, first time trying itacates, and first time trying pumpkin blossom in any form, and everything was amazing. Even though the chihatl was served icy it was still a warming drink with the cinnamon spice. The frothed texture was really cool. Very unique taste. The itacates are probably best described as Mexican samosas, but the tortillas are not deep-fried which keeps them soft. The tortilla and bean filling had an earthy flavour which paired perfectly with the flor de calabaza (I had no expectation to what pumpkin blossom would taste like but it surprisingly was very similar to pumpkin flesh). The waiter brought 3 sauces to the table for us: pico de gallo, a dark and sweet salsa roja, and a spicy salsa verde. The sauces were all delicious (I couldve eaten the roja with a spoon) but almost unnecessary as the food was so tasty even without that it felt a shame to do anything to cover it up. My parents had the Huarache Nopal and Machete Pollito and were, needless to say, very happy with those, but I didnt try them. I did try my dads hot chocolate, which is great if youre not so adventurous since it basically just tasted like a really high quality but mainstream hot choc. Also note the drinks are served in bowls made from large dried gourd husks(?) which provides a unique drinking experience. The prices are really fair for what youre getting. The total for our party (3 entrees and 2 drinks) came to about $75 before tip. The place is small and really cozy, and while the staff wasnt the most outgoing, they were polite and seemed to really care to make sure we were enjoying everything. I would really recommend this place for a truly different Mexican dining experience.",

The food was delicious, fresh and filling, made with natively cultivated ingredients from Mexico. While also pesticide- and GMO-free, the price was fair unlike those other restaurants that overcharge for labelling their food organic. We had the yuca fries, meztli cacao drink, birria tacos and rey machete. Their dining space was small, homely and full of life. The service provided by Ceci and her staff was friendly, timely and sweet. During our conversation, Ceci showed such love towards her cultures cuisine and sharing it to us with authenticity. The neighborhood kids even came in to talk to the staff. Its obvious to see that theyre an integral part of their local community. We dined in total silence; whenever we did speak it was only to share our awe of the food in front of us. Overall, it felt like a mothers cooking in the best way imaginable. I urge anyone to try this hidden gem of a restaurant out! Everyone here deserves praise and support for their phenomenal service.",

Highly recommend plus the food tastes so fresh and light makes you feel better about indulging in comfort eats. Mexican food holds a close place in my heart and I don t generally find legit Mexican outside of Mexico.

Gordita with Butter & Cheese 5. Quesabirria 6. Pozole (pork) They were all really good - really fresh and delicious. Truly reminded me of what I had on the streets of Mexico. Their rustic tortillas brought back memories of a small hole-in-the-wall shop I stumbled upon in central Merida that just sold these small simple quesadillas and nothing else, but they had a long line up of locals. The gordita may seem simple, and it is, but its really about enjoying fresh dairy stuff inside blue corn masa. And my order had a very generous, but appropriate, amount of cheese. Im glad to have discovered this restaurant.",

The decision making was based on the fact that its 2ft of quesadilla. Wish more and more delicious food was measured this way. Everything we ordered was delicious. Great combination of meat, cheese, and cactus. Its a bit tucked away in the industrial zone but definitely worth the visit and maybe another trip in the future to try their other items.",
