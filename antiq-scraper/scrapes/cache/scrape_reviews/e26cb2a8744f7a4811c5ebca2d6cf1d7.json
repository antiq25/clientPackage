The food was delicious - we had their specialty dish - Namak Mandi, and the atmosphere was cozy - the kind of place where you instantly feel at home. Cant wait to go back and enjoy another wonderful meal with such friendly and attentive staff.",

I wasnt expecting authentic Pakistani flavors but everything we ordered was perfect and took me straight back home! The Chicken Lahori Karahi was made to perfection with the right level of spice and curry sauce. Would like to thank our waiter Awais for recommending us and giving us a delightful evening with a great chat. Would definitely come here again if ever visiting Vancouver!",

            "review_text": "As someone who has always been fascinated by the rich culture and diverse cuisines of the world, I was thrilled to discover Karakoram Restaurant in Vancouver. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm hospitality and an inviting atmosphere that made me feel right at home. The decor is stylish and modern, with elegant lighting and comfortable seating. The menu features an impressive range of dishes from across the region, and the food is simply outstanding. Each dish is expertly crafted using only the freshest ingredients, and the flavours are vibrant and authentic. One of my favourite dishes is the Chicken Biryani, which is a fragrant and savoury rice dish that is seasoned with a blend of spices and herbs, and layered with succulent pieces of chicken. The lamb kebab is another must-try, with tender chunks of meat that are marinated in a delicious blend of spices and grilled to perfection. But what really sets Karakoram Restaurant apart is the exceptional service. The staff are friendly, attentive, and always willing to go above and beyond to ensure that their guests have a wonderful experience. From making recommendations to accommodating special requests, they truly go the extra mile. Whether youre a fan of Pakistani cuisine or simply looking for a unique and delicious dining experience, Karakoram Restaurant is an absolute must-visit. I cant recommend this place enough, and I look forward to my next visit!",

I dont know any other pakistani restaurant in Vancouver but I can say surely that Karakoram has the real and authentic pakistani foods. we were not sure what to order so we asked their staff (Ayesha) for her suggestions for about 5 people. She recommended BBQ platter and every dish that included in the platter was so delicious and yummy, especially chicken karahi and chicken biryani. For dessert, we tried falooda and gajar ka halwa. Both were incredibly tasty. We would love to go again to try their foods. I highly recommend karakoram restaurant for those who are looking for real taste of pakistani foods.

With more than enough to choose from on the menu, I had a hard time to decide what to order! The Palak Paneer was delicious, I used the naan to wipe off every last bit out of the bowl. The Karahi was everything you could want and tasted so fresh. Nothing was too spicy and I left with a very satisfied and full stomach. Already planning the next trip just to come back for more delicious food.",

The chicken karahi was a killer and the K2 platter which was a mix of beef and lamb kababs, chicken tikka boti and lamb boti was excellent as well! Naan, which I usually find to be weak areas for many restaurants here, were fresh, good sized and tasted great! When it came to the food, nothing disappointed, except maybe the vegetable pakoras. When good in taste and quantity, they were extremely extremely oily, which according to my wife happens when you dont let the oil heat enough before cooking. As for customer service by Pruthvi and Shadab, it was great, even if the wait time for food was quite long (~30 mins). They likely need more staff on weekend nights when it gets a little more busy than usual. Some areas for improvement that can further boost customer experience are: cleanliness, especially in the bathrooms. They were dirty and stank. Thats not good. Secondly, the ambiance needs a bit of work. It was a little dark. When it comes to dining, I prefer bright environments. However the food was so good, I could not deduct any points for this and still rate the overall experience as 5 stars! P.S the food is a little on the expensive side. It cost us around $35/head... Would visit more often if it was more economical.",

But ordered this week for take out. But it was not good experience, I even called the store back to notify them about naan s. The naan s I got with the dish was like from market of grocery store. There were bit heavy like breaded naan,they we re not cooked in store but the staff told they always cooked naan at the restaurant. I do not this so anything was taking in consideration, I did not even got a call back. Anyways when I went with my friends before we always got nice crispy and fresh naan. It s not a bad restaurant to visit one time. But as per there price is concern and quantity, you will definitely get double the quantity of food in that same price from other different restaurant. That was huge difference. Like there menu for example karahi paneer they charge 33$ with 2 naans . If you to different restaurant you get same quantity of karahi paneer for 17 or 18$",

We were going there for quick bite and so, did not fancy a full buffet. Yet, the management was considerate to seat us and accept a la carte orders. We ordered the Lahori and lamb kebab with naan. The flavors were fresh and meat was juicy and tender. The Lahori went really well with the naan. I would certainly come back to try other types of karahi dishes.

The sweet lassi had a bit of a saltiness to it which was good however you can ask for splenda if you dont like the saltiness. The mango shake was good as well. We were a group of 7 and everyone loved the food/service. Food takes a bit longer to be served but they are packed with customers which makes sense. Overall I give this place 5 stars.",

The food tastes so rich, creamy and flavourful that it makes me so happy. Recently, I went with my dad and it was his first time trying the food there..he LOVED it!! He said that it tasted exactly like how it was back home. The waiting time was only around 15 minutes since we were there as soon as it opened. The customer service is friendly and the seating is comfy too. The only light criticism I would have would be that they charge even for a tiny side dish of lettuce, onions or other veggies; but its only around a dollar and other dishes are reasonably priced. I guess it might be because they are a small business right now & inflation is on the rise so I dont mind very much. Overall, I definitely recommend going to this restaurant, itll be worth it!",

As busy as it looks the staff are always welcoming, friendly and insuring you are enjoying your meal. Food always comes hot from the oven, flavourful and tender. I have not been disappointed. Had my first delivery experience yesterday. I was skeptical on ordering directly from the website as I wasn t sure what the reply period would be... They were quick to respond, made it an easy process to order and food came quickly and just as hot as if ordered in the restaurant.  I would encourage more to order directly from the website as the delivery service was just as great as the in dining experience. My favourite dish the Full order of the chicken Kahari. Huge portions that last me days!!",
