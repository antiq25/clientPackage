She is patient, genuine, punctual, efficient, and goes the extra mile to ensure we clearly understand the issues and applicable next steps. We sincerely feel privileged to have her as our family doctor as she always makes sure we are comfortable and well-cared for. For example, Dr. Lin is mindful of slowing down her speech so my mom (English is not her first language) can carefully understand her. She is kind to always ask if we have any further questions before wrapping up our appointment as well. I also had a blood test yesterday and I did not schedule a follow-up appointment. I was pleasantly surprised that Dr. Lin called me today to go through my results together with me! We are both very thankful and appreciative of her wonderful care :)",

Pre-Covid, when my mother in law had some dizzy episodes on a Saturday, we call the office, they fit her in with another doctor in the office and follow up with a letter to Emergency. Currently, they do either phone appointments or in office appointments and most times when we are in the phone appointment, if the doctor needs to see what is concerning (a rash, take blood pressure, etc.), they do their best to find time to let you come in, luckily for us it was within the same day. They referred my mother in law for a geriatrician, and Dr Zhang is also located in the same office. Very efficient in communication and coordination. Before the Geriatrician appointment, the staff called us twice with reminders. I appreciate the calls and reminders. The online booking is the only negative. We get email notification to book for flu shots, etc but our doctor was not set up, or wont allow on the booking site.  Most times it doesnt work, so best to call the office.",

They never make eye contact and speak among themselves (which is totally fine), but on several occasions, they have would cut me off or taken a phone call while I was speaking mid-sentence. Im not sure whether they feel like theyre not valued enough to provide a basic level of customer service, but the level of care between the doctors and receptionists are not comparable.",

The staff, while friendly, are mostly unhelpful and refuse basic things (like calling a taxi for patients). The clinic itself is small and youre forced to make appointments and referrals with 10~ people a couple steps away. Anything you ask the staff or talk to the staff about, everyone will hear. This clinic also doesnt allow you to leave messages outside of clinic hours and doesnt have a voicemail system set up at all, making it impossible to cancel or reschedule appointments if youre sick or outside a normal business hours routine. With the state of healthcare in Vancouver you dont really get much of a choice in where you see a family doctor, but if you do have a choice I would recommend against going to a doctor that works at this clinic.",

When u walk in nobody will greet u when u walk to the counter. It s always a  yes  or something short and rude. Secondly I ve found myself waiting at the front desk waiting to be checked in while the group of girls finish a conversation about what they did on the weekend. Then I had an appointment today in the pm and they ve known since at least 8am they will be closed due to snow but choose to call me from a blocked number an hour before to short cancel my appointment. This appointment has already been moved two times. Lastly, when I called to ask a question about blood work one of the front end girls gave me the wrong information and again two weeks of my time has been wasted. If I wasn t pregnant and in need of a dr I would leave this clinic in a second ONLY based on the worst customer service I ve ever received. That being said I love dr curry. I give her 10/5 stars and will ONLY continue at forward care medical because of her!",
