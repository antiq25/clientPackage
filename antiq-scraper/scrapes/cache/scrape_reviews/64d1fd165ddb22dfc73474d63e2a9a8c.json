Had to piece out after the first attempt and came back during a weekday after lunch time. I guess thats expected when you turn Michelin. Ordered the classic egg noodles and chicken wings, good as ever! Looks like the restaurant has been passed down the family generation but the taste is still classic. Highly recommended if youre in Vancouver and dont mind a wait or eating off hours. Worth it.",

            "review_text": "A friend visiting from San Francisco really wanted to go to Phnom Penh during her stay.  She came to the restaurant on her last visit and she said she needed to come to the restaurant again every time she visits Vancouver so we took her there for an early lunch this week. I remember coming here years ago and did not have a good impression of what I had but I m quite glad we took my friend there this time.  We loved our dishes so much that they were probably the best foods we had during her visit. We had deep fried chicken wings, tong choy (water spinach), rare beef filet with anchovies and deep fried crab meat rolls.  I could eat the chicken wings and crab meat rolls all day long.  Al;though deep fried, the wings and rolls were light in texture but also full of flavours at the same time. The slightly sweet undertone in the coating of the chicken wing batter was addictive. We came here on a Monday morning shortly after 1100 when they open and we walked right in.  By 1130, there were already people waiting for tables at the door.",

The fried chicken wings has a very crispy yet light batter, which is also quite flavourful. Chicken is moist on the inside and it s relatively simple, yet so good. I like how refreshing the papaya salad is - it s nice and crunchy, perfect for a hot day outside. Sour soup is more of a warm weather dish, but packed with flavour and one of my favourite soups. It has items like pineapple for sweetness, tomatoes make it a bit tart and it s quite hearty as well. Beef luc lac was okay, I remember the beef being better last time so it could be a one off  however, fried egg is a must! I wasn t a big fan of the noodles either, felt it was a bit too oily and lacked flavour, other people at the table enjoyed it though, so I m not sure. Tong choy was really good as well, good portion, right flavour and not over cooked. Overall, the food is great here. Price is also reasonable being around $25 per person. Service to food is relatively quick. I would make reso s if you re a larger party though, otherwise expect to wait! I d definitely try this place and find out for yourself if it s worth the hype!",

The trifecta of dishes (I.e chicken wings, beef luc lac and beef carpaccio) are what most people try on their 1st visit and often default to on their 10th re-visit. There is a great deal of hype for the three dishes mentioned; however, try them with no expectations and you will not be disappointed! Beware of long wait times throughout the weekend AND weekdays. If visiting with a large group of 7 or more, it would be preferred to reserve two weeks in advance to secure a table.",

We got the basil clams, tong choy, dry noodles, large chicken wings and com dac rice combo. The noodles werent the best since it was takeout and ended up being dry and bland. The clams were flavourful and you got a huge portion. The Com dac rice was good and the tong choy had good flavour. THE STAR OF THE SHOW WAS THE CHICKEN WINGS!!! Even after driving 45 min home in a takeout container the chicken wings were the best I ever had. In fact it was so good, we decided to try to come back to eat it in the restaurant. We ended up going back at 2pm the next day and still had to wait 45 min for a table of 3. We ordered the chicken wings and the butter beef. The butter beef had good spicy flavor and we also ordered the beef bo luc lac which was moist and flavourful. Overall highly recommend, the wait is worth it!",

            "review_text": "I ve been coming to Phnom Penh for over a decade and introduced many friends to this restaurant. Prices are still reasonable considering how popular it is. Our go-to order: Stew Beef Rice Noodle, Beef Lu Lac with Rice (no egg because we re cheap), Fried Chicken Wings (Large  trust me). When I want to treat myself I add: Rare beef (again, trust me, it s SO good) and a Moo Moo Shake. The stew beef soup has a perfect hint of sweetness from the carrot and beef. Beef luc lac is simple and perfect for picky eaters. The chicken wings are even more famous than rare beef, crunchy with a hint of sweetness - but it s the lemon pepper sauce that keeps you craving more. Every time I taste the sauce I want to pull a Plankton and sneak in their kitchen for the secret recipe. During today s visit, a bug kept flying around my plate and got stuck in my rice. We asked for a new plate to use - the young server was professional and took it really seriously, even offering to replace the whole original dish but we reassured him it was just my own plate. He checked in with us through our meal and even brought us a delicious tapioca taro dessert because he felt bad about the bug in my food. He made our experience 110% better - to note, the general service staff are friendly all around. Legends about the wait times are true: even on a Monday evening your wait for 2 will be 30-40 minutes. When it s busy, expect anywhere from 1-2 hours. Leave your # and they ll text you to confirm once a table is available. They only take resos for 8+ group sizes. FYI their washroom and tap water is notoriously cold, try to avoid it in the winter time!",

Even at odd hours in between lunch and dinner this place still had a waitlist going but luckily we were seated after 15 minutes waiting around. The interior gives cozy mom and pop vibes and the menu is pretty extensive. My recommendations are the fried chicken wings which come in a small or large serving and have a delicious salty breading with a peppery dipping sauce, as well as the fried beef with egg on top of a bed of fried rice. The fried rice was something else with so many amazing flavors all combined into one dish.",

I d recommend Fat Mao thai noodle house down the street if the wait is too long. Food: The Butter Beef (raw beef) brought a surprising freshness to the meal - cilantro and citrus. I d order an egg on top of the Beef Luc Lac next time. I would order everything again + the #4 next time because so many people around us ordered it. The atmosphere is like a busier Chinatown BBQ. Fast service, hot food, kind staff. This place has been around for a long time! I d highly recommend it.",

I tried a few dishes that are not popular, just to see if they are good at other dishes too, and they didn t disappoint. All the dishes I tried were good. The deep fried prawn balls are good, so bouncy, and cooked just right, still juicy on the inside. Prawn supreme wrapped in sugar cane were the bomb, not every Vietnamese restaurant offer that, and they made it so well, prawn combined with the sweetness of the sugar cane takes the flavour profile to the next level. I will order this dish again, even it s $17 for 2 pieces Service was good in Chinese/Asian standard. One of the best in the city, can t wait to try other dishes",

My team and I arrived around 3:30 pm and waited less than 30 minutes to be seated. The waiting system is convenient as we left phone numbers for the restaurant to contact us when our table was available. Phnom Penh was definitely busy with lots of customers but there were a lot of servers who were pretty much available whenever needed. We ordered Marinated Butter Beef, Deep-Fried Chicken Wings (Large Size), Bo Luc Lac, Dry Noodles (can choose egg or rice) and Spicy Squid. Every dish was so distinctively marinated and cooked. The portions are not huge but average, except for the Marinated Butter Beef which I hope was bigger as it is a dish that only you can enjoy in Phnom Penh. Both fried chicken wings and squid were nicely fried without being too greasy. Please do not be hesitant to visit Phnom Penh for amazing Cambodian & Vietnamese dishes as it is definitely worth the wait and experience!",

            "review_text": "I have no idea if Phnom Penh changed the way they take reservations and walkins but the way they treated our group on a Saturday night was absolutely spectacular. For the regular restaurant goers, this place is always packed and has a hefty line. At first when we went we thought it would be a rush in and out as it usually is but our server very kindly told us that we had an allotted time and to not worry and to not rush instead reassuring us to take our time. For a place as busy as this it was an odd and refreshing experience to know that we had extra time to digest a meal and enjoy ourselves. I hope this doesn t make any newbies scared to go however it s just a common thing in any restaurant to kind of eat get your bill and then leave rather than chat up for three hours over 1 cup of coffee. Usually the trifecta is the beef luc lac, butter beef and chicken wings - but this time it only felt satisfactory instead of the star acts. The wings weren t as plump and juicy and the luc lac was just regular. That being said - it s hard to not order the favourites, just a bit of a different dining experience than usual for Those dishes. We also ordered the oyster pancake (crispy and light), fried rice cake (kind of like a mix between radish cake and tteokbokki with a delicious and flavourful dipping sauce) and pea tips (you know - to get those veggies in). For dessert we also ordered the taro pudding which was a nice ending and very starchy (naturally duh) so it was perfect to share between the 6 of us instead of each ordering a dish. They also still have their birthday option where they turn the lights off in the whole restaurant sings happy birthday as the stuffing in the cake which is always nice. The staff are nice here - they wore masks as of December 3rd and are very attentive. There is a small  waiting area  inside the restaurant so most groups are asked to wait outside - dress accordingly in case those lines are long! Groups of 6 can call ahead for reservations and are subject to 18% gratuity (of course confirm with them as these reviews have info subject to change). Phnom Penh is one of our fav places to go for comfort food.",

Once we were seated, we placed our order and surprisingly the food came out in less than 5 minutes. The servers kindly changed out our dishes to help with cleanliness and the remaining bones from the wings. Dishes were ordered were: stew beef in hot pot (wonderful beef slices and tendons with melt in your mouth carrots), papaya salad (so refreshing), marinated butter beef (absolutely yum), spicy squid (so juicy), a beef dish over lettuce (cant remember the name), and a shrimp noodle dish.

You can definitely find crowds of people lining up to dine at this restaurant. We decided to order take-out instead of dining in just because it was so busy tonight. The food still came out great, and we still came out happy. We ordered their famous fried chicken wings, Phnom Penh Deep-fried Chicken Wings, 2 orders of their Filet Beef Luc Lac on Rice with Eggs, and the Marinated Butter Beef also known as, Marinated Thit Bo. My boyfriend and I would have to rate this restaurant a 5/5. One, for their quality of food, two, for their service, and three, for their politeness. Although it was super busy, the gentleman helping us remembered our orders and was very courteous. Thank you, Phnom Penh! I would definitely recommend this restaurant for others to come and dine when it is not quite busy or even have it ordered for take-out. It is worth the try!",

Sausage fried rice was a really hearty bowl as expected, but I was really curious about Cha Kappip under Kitchen Suggestions. The main element in the dish is ground pork in fried shrimp and chili paste accompanied by lettuce, cabbage, tomatoes, and cucumber sliced Tear a piece of the green and add a proportionate amount of pork on it. Top with a tomato slice. Both the crunchiness of lettuce/cabbage against the pork and the sourness of tomato result in a perfect bite. Garlic prawns is also highly recommended. The salty-garlicky prawn goodness under that crispy outer layer makes you go back for more.",

            "review_text": "I am SO happy I was able to squeeze this glorious place into my YVR itinerary. First thing I ll say I liked about this place is that they were one of very few restaurants that had an automated waitlist with text notifications! You d think in a busy tourist city like Vancouver more places would have this. Upon entry, you are greeted with the most divine smell of Vietnamese and Cambodian cuisine. I can t even put into words how good it smells in there. Excited as ever, we started with the Fried Chicken Wings and Garlic Fried Shrimp and  God in heaven. I don t know what they put in those or how they cook these items but WOW. I ve never had anything that can compare to how delicious these are. The wings were definitely the star of this show but the shrimp came pretty close. Both were so crispy, savoury and real garlicky! I also really loved the sort of lemon dipping sauce that comes with the wings. For entrees we ordered Filet Beef Luc Lac with Egg and Phnom Penh Jumbo Rice with Pork Chops. The Jumbo Rice was pretty good, the pork chops were undoubtedly well seasoned. BUT THE BEEF LUC LAC?????? Phenomenal. This dish was literally the perfect balance of sweet and savoury. The beef was so delicious, and when mixed together with the vegetables and egg yolk- heavenly. I really enjoyed the underlying coconut flavour in the dish as well. I also tried some of their Black Peppered Squid and it was yummy too! Not only was the food good, but the service was too. Our food was prepared in lightening speed, so it really made up for the 30 minute wait to be seated. Honestly, I m so glad I came here and it would have really been a shame if I missed out on such a place. Phnom Penh is truly a MUST stop in Vancouver.",

So many delicious flavours! We got the papaya salad and I believe it was #80 beef with bean sprouts. The portion sizes are quite large so I would say the food is quite reasonably priced even on the cheaper side. I highly recommend this place!",

They have a good system with callback so that you can walk around in Chinatown instead of crowding in the waiting area. The food was excellent! The fried chicken wings and Butter beef (dont let the name fool you - its actually thin raw beef in marinade) were recommended as their specialty and they were great! And to top that the service was genuinely friendly and helpful. Thank you!",

From the famous chicken wings to the melt-in-your-mouth butter beef to the simplicity of fried rice with Chinese sausage... You cant go wrong. We came by in early December and dine-in was a little less busy than in the past (covid related no doubt) but picked up as we were finishing. Some other recommendations to try here is the Beef Luc Lac (you can either get a small order served with rice and a fried egg or get a large serving by itself and pair it with a full dish of fried rice). The squid here is similar to the addictive chicken wings and is often overlooked but worth the try. If it wasnt so darn cold out, we would have picked up one of their tasty moo shakes.",
