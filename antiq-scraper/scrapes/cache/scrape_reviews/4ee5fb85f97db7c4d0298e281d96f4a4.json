The beet salad was so fresh and light on a warm day and the margarita pizza was lovely. The crust had a wonderful flavor and was cooked to perfection. All of the beers we had were light but very flavorful. Would definitely visit here again.",

Theres now a sweet patio outside to enjoy the summer weather too! Come here for amazing pizza & tasty beer - they are all phenomenal. Highly recommended for all your beer and pizza needs!",

Tell me a place that has all 3, I ll be waiting oh and free parking nearby. . . The Hawaiian pizza is my go to here - chunks of pineapple and drizzled with jalapeno cream. It is beyond heavenly   we tried the meat pizza for the first time during our pizza and lemme tell you - IT IS loaded with meat. They definitely didn t skimp out on the topping. . . As for their drinks, the pink lemonade is my go to, I ve also tried their other lemon mandarin racket before but found it abit to sour for my liking. Go and soak up some  before we get our 9 months of rain again . . Shout out to the staff for being so accommodating with the dogs! Their bowls were constantly refilled with water",

I would note that Im partial to sours, and I look forward to all their Love Buzz/Imperial Love Buzz series beers. However, I would be remiss to not mention their pizza. How good is pizza made at a brewery, you may ask? Id say in contention with Via Tevere for best pizza in town. The pizza+beer combo is heavenly - you gotta experience it for yourself.",

A must visit for anyone. There is wine, soda and kombucha as well, for those wanting to enjoy the delicious cuisine but prefer something other than beer. Product purchase is also available.

Nice thin crust amazing flavours stringy hot cheese just insanely good I was blown away!! Not to mention the homemade dips they make in house! You have to try their homemade ranch it s amazing !!

Every bite/sip took me to another planet. 1,000,000/10. If there is just one suggestion I can make, is GET THE STUFFED DATES! Literally the best thing I have ever tasted in my entire life. I went to jupider. Had to order another round of the stuffed dates they were just THAT GOOD. Please... I beg the chef to never remove these from the menu... They are THAT good! Thank you for the epic taste bud experience, Strathcona!",
