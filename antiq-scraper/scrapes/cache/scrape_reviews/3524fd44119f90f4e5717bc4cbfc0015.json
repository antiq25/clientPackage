            "review_text": "BREAD PERFECTION !! Im not normally a sandwich person but I have to say this was by far the best sandwich Ive ever had in my life.  I had the crispy chicken special (recipe changes weekly) and this time it had truffle in it.  All the components that were in the sandwich from the house made bread to the sauce to the breaded chicken to the fresh greens inside were super fresh, and super tasty and flavourful. So many times a breaded chicken can easily be too dry or too salty but this was pure perfection. I also had a cruffin that had a delightfully light and fresh filling and an oat milk latte and both were also items I would come back for individually as well.  To absolutely nail it on all 3 items is a major feat, and truly a testament to this hole in the wall. Chefs kiss! Will absolutely be back.",

            "review_text": "The main differentiation for #e is that their sandwich contents are served hot. Unlike the pre-made sandwiches from coffee shops that are grilled on the outside, these are made to order   just like the ones I would make at home. The fresh ingredients and hot proteins make the sandwiches very enjoyable and comfort-food-like. We ordered two vegetarians. The roasted vegetables taste freshly roasted and not re-heated   I hope they are. I selected gluten free bread which tastes like real bread, only I didnt appreciate that the loaf was so narrow. A big disappointment for me was the olive tapenade. While the olive livened the taste, the garlic in the tapenade made me uncomfortable for a number of hours afterwards. But we will definitely be back to try other fillings and salads.",

The place is small and very cozy, idk how it is when it gets busy but when I was there it was very spacious. Latte is also good not bitter and milk isnt too frothy or burned.

Ordered London Fog (didnt know that the drink was said to be invented in Vancouver!), something from the menu, and some random cakes from the counter. Surprisingly everything was tasty! We ended up coming back again the day on our departure to pack some more pastries to go. Some reviews mentioned the service. Id say you would not feel the most welcoming atmosphere here, maybe because staff were busy in the morning hours,  but everyone was very friendly to us, despite that our little ones were hungry and loud.. They did not rush us, gave us good suggestions, extra cups, etc. I would come back again next time in town.",

There is a limited selection on deck, but what they do have is a special combination of flavours that make for some sumptuous meals. Top them off with some superior soda selections; they re here too. I ve had the BLT and meatloaf sandwiches here. Both were great.  They had flavours unlike each other and I m sure the rest of the selection is the same.  The bread is distinct and tastes like it was made the same day. This is certainly a component that sets this apart from other sandwich shops. Make sure you pay attention when ordering though, as these are not subtle flavours! The restaurant itself is small and has limited seating. However, this allows for some intimacy and coziness. Just don t bring the baseball team and things will be fine, although you certainly might want to if you want them to feel rewarded!",

I ordered the chicken sandwich, which actually took a while to make but Im not gonna complain about the time because when a sandwich takes 10 minutes to make and tastes that delicious, I could care less! They have a small menu and a variety of fresh juices in the fridge. I really enjoyed my experience at this sandwich shop and hope more people walk in and try it out.",

My crispy chicken parmesan sandwich was finger licking good in a creative, carefully- made way that the Colonel could never have imagined.  The sauce of tomato, basil pesto and bechamel was also outstanding.  The fact that they make their own bread is another sign of their commitment to freshness and flavour.  The lamb on Thursdays is delicious. This would be a great meal to eat on the grass near Sunset Beach, if not at one of their tables. Or at home with the cat looking meaningfully at us.",

Well, unfortunately I ll never enjoy another Reuben sandwich again UNLESS IT S FROM THIS PLACE.  I m a Reuben kinda nut, and I felt like I had never had one before once I started eating this. Great or best doesn t even come close. The take home meals looked great and regretted I couldn t eat more with the time I had. I ve been looking for a  legit  sandwich shop for a year or two in the city, but am only there on business a few times and week and don t always have a lot of free time. So after trying different places I ve found online, and researching YELP and a million other places... I just accidentally stumble into this one, and only cuz I saw  dude eating the sandwich outside. Very low key, have walked by a bunch and never realized what I was missing. My only regret is, after passing by this place a lot getting my haircut, etc... I realize I ve missed out on probably a dozen or so occasions that I could have been eating here. I ll make up for lost time. Do yourself a favour, and just eat a sandwich here. You ll see.",
