            "review_text": "Chris and team took over the site from an early botched attempt at a landscape installation on my 15,000 sqft property -- new construction and they were late in the game towards competition, we had to GO. It was still ground zero landscape wise, but even the landscape architecture was flawed and not what I wanted to achieve. We had to start over. While I had the tone, feeling, vibe and texture I wanted, the details were outside my scope, I had no idea how to get this done. Chris leaned in, created ideas and concepts from the words I had to share, partnered with a designer for even more input and we executed -- GCLC executed. They crushed the installation. Heavy equipment everywhere, dirt flying, landscape going down and yet, every single day they left the site, immaculate. Contractors dont work this way, ever. GCLC does. There is pride in every job that you rarely see, in each day, in how they show up, how they leave and if issues arise, pride in how they work to solve those issues. It was beautiful. It is beautiful. Since then, GCLC has continued on with me for 4 years -- weekly maintenance, snow removal in the winter (and they literally sing together, while moving snow in the cold! ...when the people are happy, the work done is always better, huge cheers to the culture this company has been able to create, its impressive). Each spring, we always find the next project to build on the overall theme. The maintenance team cares, as if its their house... and weve found, dare I say friendship! Its great to see them each week, always hustling, grabbing my input as they go. New tree, new garden bed? New drainage problem that came out of nowhere from an ever changing landscape? Lets never stop building GCLC -- you will always be my landscape team.",

Instead of driving away he went looking for the owner of the vehicle to take responsibility. The owner of GCL made it so easy for us to have it fixed. After having a bad experience with another company, we thought we would give GCL a chance. If you have employees that are responsible for their actions like Luke, you must be a great company to hire! We were right, these guys did a great job. They weren t cheap, but you can t buy a Ferrari for the price of a Honda. Two guys came and worked hard all day and got our job done (garden and our lawn). They were worth every penny. We will recommend them to anyone that asks, and we will be using them every year! Thank you GCL, you guys are awesome!",

For years we fantasized about transforming our back yard from moss/ant infested concrete pavers with an uninspiring rock garden perimeter to an inspired eating and living space complete with cosy fireplace and easy to maintain yet beautiful landscaping. Choosing companies is mostly a random exercise so from the moment we initially met to discuss the plans, until the project was complete, it was nothing short of spectacular. Of importance, is that everyone who worked on the project offered many suggestions and solutions that ultimately added value to the final outcome. Plus the project was completed on time and on budget and everyone was professional, friendly and went beyond what was expected. Save yourself the agonizing search for a company that will meet all your expectations and choose Great Canadian Landscaping. Sandi Yang",

Our previous company over salted and killed a number of our garden plants as well as an expensive hedge. As well their attention to snow clearing was lacking at best. I was constantly out clearing our walkways and the city sidewalks that where our legal responsibility. GCLC uses IceMelt, a pet safe product, and a much more careful and thoughtful application that seems to not affect our plants as much, AND the gold star, the snow clearing is down to the concrete. Our sidewalks are clearer than our neighbours! The areas around entrances, recycling and garbage areas are thoroughly cleared making me worry less for my older neighbours whom the slippery conditions are a hazard. Thank you GCLC!
