            "review_text": "It was a great service with Canadian tire center! We had a nail on one of our rear tire. We went to costco, bigotire and Mr. lube to get opinions. We were told that we had to replace all 4 tires without even checking. But we just replace a brand new front tire a year ago and only drove less than 3000 Km since. Costco was the worst of all! They were so impatience and told us they had to replace all four tires because they had to be the same brands because they did not carry my tires brand. Their attitude was the worst!  Canadian tire was our last store to get opinion on.  Gensis, Nash and Steven were very helpful and Gensis was very patience with us. He explained a lot of things to us and help us understand the situation. After listening to our story, Gensis told us that they would first check if our tire was repairable then offered options if it was not.  Both Costco and Mr. Lube never even bothered to do what Canadian tire did. They just assumed that we had a nail and all our four tires were needed to be replaced. Gensis at Canadian tire is such a nice guy and a great supervisor/manager I assumed. He went an extra mile for the customer and put our best interest first! As a business owner myself, I really think it is hard to find a great employee like Gensis these days.  In the end, it turned out to be that our tire only needed a patch. It only cost us 70 dollar! At Costco, they quoted us for almost $3000 to replace all tires. We will for sure go back to Canadian for future replacement!  We would 100% recommend this Canadian tire center at Cambie.",

He took down all my details and told me to call him if I needed anything at all.  As someone who worked for two separate Canadian tires for about 3 years, Booth I appreciate you. Customer coming in frantically 30 mins before close? Likely underpaid/undervalued, and definitely overworked?

They were blowing them out by the time I got there so I got a beautiful $99 tree for $30. The universe loves me :) The Canadian Tire money promos also save me lots of money.

I had quite the experience here over the past month, which started from me trying to simply get my seasonal tire change done. A lot went wrong, but, each time, the service advisors were extremely helpful in explaining why and how, and doing their best to make it right. Which they did. Due strictly to their fantastic service (specifically, Laura and Daniel, A+), this shop gets a no-questions 5/5. Good customer service is the single most important aspect of a successful business, in my opinion, and here it was knocked out of the park. If things go wrong and time is lost to visits where nothing gets done, a good service advisor can make all the difference. When the job finally got done, it got done right, so no issues there. It ended up with me buying a new set of tires and the aligning/balancing that goes with that. The tires are on, the wheels are aligned and balanced, and nothing feels off.",

I usually like to look over the discount plant shelf to see if theres anything there that Im care to try to rescue. I ended up picking up two plants (one 5 cm & 10 cm) n the bigger one was almost dried out. I decided to dunk it in a large container nearby that was filled with water n it had a watering can. After I was done n was trying to get out of the closely packed area, a staff member noticed that I picked up some discount plants n complimented me on trying to rescue some of them. After a short conversation, she ended up offering me two of the small 5 cm plants for free as her Xmas gift to me as it was clear that it easily made me happy. Her name was Pat n she said that why not make someone happy if its easy for her to do so n wished me Merry Xmas. I was very pleased with her kindness and wished her the same. TYVM again Pat giving me such a great experience. One more thing, I dont really enjoy being made to use the self check out machines n sincerely wish that theres an option to purchase products from a humin cashier. So many issues come up with using these machines and I dont enjoy the experience. Thats it. Thanks again, Pat!!",

            "review_text": "I was looking for a garden hose nozzle and I got one at $7.99. Its the certified metal rear-trigger pistol. It can do some spray painting but Ill try it as is. Reviews on Canadian Tire app says its pretty good compared to more expensive ones including the plastic options. The Canadian Tire employees were very helpful too. I asked three employees for directions since its my first time in this branch and I was wheeling a very cranky taby (toddler baby). If you want to the garden centre, the entrance is the one adjacent to Cambie, not the Cambie one. I repeat not the entrance on Cambie street. Its especially helpful to know this when you also have a stroller or on a wheelchair and going up to  the garden centre. I wanted to buy other things such as veggie seedlings on sale but it was almost impossible with a wailing kid in tow.",

I just returned it and took a look at the isle with drills, to try to catch what I missed. A Canadian Tire associate named *MAGGIE* came to assist me. Though she didnt laugh at me (thank you), she did give me a ton of - easy to understand - info on drills, and even took the time to go over pricing with me, even after I said I wasnt going to buy today. You folks have a blazing gold star with this associate, please give her all the kudos/stars/BONUSES/prize. Maggie is the reason I will get this item from Canadian Tire (instead of Amazon or Wal-Mart). Thanks again!!!",
