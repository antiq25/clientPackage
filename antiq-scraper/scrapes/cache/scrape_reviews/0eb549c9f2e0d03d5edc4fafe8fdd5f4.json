Stoli martinis were expertly made (hard to mess that up, but it s happened), very cold .this place can do no wrong. The people next to us had the fish &chips, looked fantastic. We also ordered the burger (very good) and a salad of some kind (can t recall). If you visit Vancouver this place is one of my  must-see locations .",

The sun was directly in our eyes, but the attentive waiter brought an extra umbrella to shield us from the glare. Our party of six ordered appetizers, steaks, and drinks, and everything was excellent. This restaurant stands out as the first place that prepared my steak exactly as I wanted it   medium rare, cooked to perfection. One of my friends ordered theirs rare and it ended up slightly overcooked, but they still found it enjoyable and were satisfied with their meal.",

Personable and funny and checked in the perfect amount of times. Hes the type of server that elevates your dining experience. I applaud the entire staff as their communication was great and they all worked together to handle a packed house very efficiently. Now onto the food. We did the Crispy Calamari, Truffle Parmesan Fries, Miso Glazed Short Ribs, and Joes Chilled Seafood Platter. We closed it out with the Creme Brulee. The calamari was the best Ive ever had. We ended out grabbing a 2nd order of those. Fries were tasty. The short ribs were so-so. Our favorites on the seafood platter were the scallop ceviche and the albacore tuna crudo. The prawns were some big boys as well. All of the seafood tasted fresh and the platter had great plating. The creme brulee was presented well and took a couple of hits to crack through the top which is expected. Amazing! Overall, the food quality, price point, and service puts this place at 5 stars for me.",

            "review_text": "I recently had the pleasure of dining at Joe Fotes seafood restaurant, and it was truly an incredible experience from start to finish. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm and friendly service that set the tone for the entire evening. The ambiance of the restaurant was perfect for a seafood lover like myself. The nautical decor & soft lighting created a relaxing and inviting atmosphere. Now, lets talk about the star of the show   the food. Joe Fotes seafood restaurant exceeded all of my expectations. The menu was a seafood lovers dream come true, with a wide variety of fresh catches from the sea. I started with my favorite: fish & chips. However, the portion size was huge. We ended with seable fish and paired it with a nice bottle of champagne. We finished with Creme brulee and chocolate cake. Highly recommend this restaurant.",

I really wanted the sable fish which is usually only available for dinner, but Anais pulled some strings in the kitchen and I was able to have it for lunch today :) Its one of my fave dishes here as the fish is so buttery and the miso glaze is nice and sweet. My friend had the halibut which she loved. We also shared the deep fried oysters which were delicious. Our coffees were constantly refilled for us (thank you) and Anais brought us the tastiest dessert which happened to also be one of my faves... The creme brulee! The rooftop patio is one of the prettiest in the city and even though today was partly cloudy, we were very comfortable sitting up there. Joe Fortes is a restaurant I always recommend to my friends. Not only is the food and service consistently great but the restaurant always donates a gift card to our hospital unit every Christmas :) HealthCare workers absolutely love Joe Fortes! Thank you!",

The food was absolutely delicious (as always) & we had an amazing server who was super attentive. I wish I got his name! One of my friends had a severe garlic allergy and we quickly learned she couldn t have anything on the menu but the oysters. The waiter apologized multiple times but she is very used to that when going out to eat so she was totally unbothered by it. It came as a huge pleasant surprise to us when he brought out a complementary dish from the Chef that she could have! Thank you, Chef! What a service. Lastly thank you so much for the birthday dessert. That creme brulee was delicious! You can tell a restaurant has an amazing internal culture when everyone comes together to make your experience top notch.",

Our server Mya was lovely, friendly and attentive - she went above and beyond. We appreciated the complimentary birthday dessert, it was yummy! Only con, they need a better system for group bills, should be way more efficient - we waited 25 to 30 mins for the final, accurate bill per person (made us late for the mani/pedi appointment we had scheduled).

There are different kinds of oyster, it was hard to choose between them. But our server kindly explained and I ve got her favorite and the choice was totally right. Salmon and lobster soup were amazing as well! Lastly the Cream brulee makes me satisfied.",

We went for lunch and ordered their calamari, lobster roll, Sable fish and a series of oysters. While everything we ordered was delicious, the Sable fish was probably the best prepared fish weve ever had. Top off the amazing food with stellar service from our server Norm and it was an exemplary experience from start to finish. Couple months later we also received a handwritten letter from Norm/the restaurant and it was so far above and beyond what we would expect that Joe Fortes will definitely be a spot we go to every time were in Vancouver. Highly recommended!",

Food is incredible. The 16 oz steak (medium; Chicago-style sear) was perfect  over filling actually  ditto for the Chef s seafood special (market cost) with salmon, scallops, prawns and veggies. A bottle of cold Rose wine finished off this excellent meal.  We left this restaurant limping and bawling in glorious full-tummy stretched-belly-burst tight-pants pain but, you know, im referring to the wonderful over-eating glutton kind of pain (you know what I mean).  Definitely will go again for a special occasion; it is expensive ($350 all in after tax/tip for one helluva meal for two) but you get what you pay for. Service is very fast and accurate. Decor is upscale and there is a dress code at dinner (business casual; beware sneaker wearers). Just an excellent all-round chop house in downtown Vancouver.  Oof, time to lie down and unbutton everything",

Only thing the party didnt like was the shrimp, which were slightly rubbery. The tacos were nicely spiced and the lobster rolls were buttery and decadent. Get the cheesecake for dessert! Its fluffier than a regular New York Style Cheesecake and has a hint of lemon with homemade shipped cream. I could have eaten three slices myself because it was so light.",

The seafood platter was amazing with a ton of variety and the lobster/shrimp roll was delicious too. Service was very attentive and prompt, a great time all around.",

The complimentary bread came with lobster infused oil and balsamic vinegar as a dip, and the lobster was fragrant. The highlights were the steelhead trout (melted in our mouth, and were still raving about the vin blanc sauce) and Tahitian vanilla creme brulee (bitter, caramelized topping balanced the custard perfectly). The only downside is that its not a place to go for a quiet evening out. Theres lots of chatter and the tables are relatively close to each other, along with live piano music from an upper level. Had a great experience here in both quality and size of the dishes. Would return for a special occasion!",

I had the salmon listed on the menu of the day. I was expecting a bit more flavour to it but honestly it was beso cooked and presented. The rest of the dishes were amazing. When I go back I will want to try their Seafood Cioppinno, my sister loved it and Desserts were good but nothing impressive. Wine selection is to die for. Just be ready to spend some cash! :)",

For oysters, there are several types to choose from. Im not an expert, i told the waiters of my preference for oyster, he choose of us. And they are just the way i like them. Mussels cooked in wine, now mussel is my favorite. I even drink all the sauce. Its that good! Lobster roll is perfect too. Generous amount of lobster meat mixed with mayo, salad and gherkin on the side. Last but not the least, Tiramisu. Ordered half portion, which is perfect size. It is ok. Average. Had better tiramisu.

I think we ordered a lot for 2 people, but had enough leftovers for another meal. They served us bread with a lobster oil balsamic dip to start. I have never had lobster oil dipped bread and it was amazing! We got the oysters rockefeller, clam chowder, and steak tartare to start. Oysters were pretty big size and delicious. Clam chowder was clammy with a hint of bacon. Steak tartare is my favourite dish and it did not disappoint. For mains, we ordered the shortrib with risotto and kale, and the seafood ciopinno. Shortrib was by far the best thing Ive had. Oh, we also got the brussel sprouts on the side, which were fried up and salty. For dessert, we ordered the half size creme brulee, which was still a massive portion! We also ordered the chocolate cake, which was also huge, for takeout as our server highly recommended it. I will definitely be back at Joe Fortes next time Im in Vancouver!",

Our server Norm was efficient, funny, and fun to have around. We started with the Joe s Coffee Cake - today it was Double Chocolate served with Honey on Butter on the side.. split for 4 people is perfect starter to a great brunch.. yes we are a dessert first family.. please don t judge us My sister have the Signature Eggs Benny - scrumptious and eggs done to perfection and the hollandaise sauce was perfect. My brother in law had the Fish and Chips and the fish was tender while the outside is crunchy but not over fried. We couldn t decide as everything on the menu all looked so good. We ordered steak tartare, steamed mussels, and the Lobster Roll. All the food came at once and they kindly split the lobster roll for us.. even half it was huge, and it was full of fresh prawn and lobster with a lovely side salad. We really enjoyed the broth of the mussels and the wonderful toasted homemade bread on top. The steak tartare is excellent and serving was fresh and quite big with 4 pieces of garlic home made toast and side salad. While we are enjoying lunch, there is a lovely piano player, John situated on the turn of the staircase on your way to the upstairs washroom. Not sure if there is any washroom for seniors or handicapped downstairs. In the summer, the restaurant also open the patio upstairs. Another item we wanted to try was Chicken and Waffles, the table beside us ordered it and it was quite a large portion, so maybe next time.",

Muscles, oysters, dessert, sides were amazing with fresh bread with 2 oil and vinegars for dipping that tasted amazing. Medium rare steak was not consistent throughout with more than I would have liked being rare. Almost a near perfect experience and score.

The place reminded me of the Mad Men show, which tells the stories of PR men in New York.  The food is good, and the service is perfect.

            "review_text": "I recently had the misfortune of dining at this seafood restaurant, and I must say it was a dreadful experience from start to finish. Firstly, the service was abysmal. We were left waiting for what felt like an eternity just to be seated, even though the restaurant wasnt particularly busy. Once we were finally seated, it took ages for a server to come to our table. When they did arrive, they seemed disinterested and inattentive throughout the entire meal. The food was even more disappointing. I ordered the seafood platter, expecting a delicious assortment of fresh seafood. What I got was a plate of overcooked, rubbery, and tasteless seafood that was clearly not fresh. It was as if they had pulled it out of the freezer and microwaved it. To add insult to injury, the prices were exorbitant for the low-quality food and service we received. It felt like a complete rip-off, and I left feeling like I had wasted my hard-earned money on a subpar dining experience. I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone. Save your time and money and go somewhere else where you can actually enjoy a decent seafood meal and receive proper service. This place is a complete disappointment, and I wont be returning.",
