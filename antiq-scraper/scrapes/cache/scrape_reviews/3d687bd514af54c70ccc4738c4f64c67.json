We ordered one of the burgers which the waiter suggested and it didnt disappoint. The chicken salad was also tasty. The kids had their Kids meals, which were great value with a drink and ice cream. Our waiter Joe was awesome and gave excellent service. Gave lots of recommendations on what to do in Vancouver too",

My 2 youngest ordered the waffles and berries, and i felt it was a bit small for a 7 & 8 year old. My 2 oldest ordered the BC Summer Start....yup that Hit the spot for them! I ordered the Eggs Benedict, i had to being in Canada!! Let me just say..YUMMO!! I highly recommend this dish!! The ONLY con was how expensive the drinks were, $3.50 for a glass of OJ, and the same for coffee. But other than that...yum!!",

Atmosphere is warm and friendly, and it is nice that the TVs are conveniently located so no matter where you sit you can see one. Theres lots of seating, and several big booths. The only thing I would say is that I ordered a Legendary Burger, but wasnt asked if I wanted lettuce and tomato but I didnt realize it, and when I got my order I didnt know for a second what it was. But thats my only complaint, this restaurant really is great and I would definitely recommend it!",

When we arrived, we were all sat together in one section of the restaurant and meals were brought out very quickly. Bills were also dealt with efficiently. Each and every server was polite, kind and patient- and this is no small feat when serving a group of teens! Huge shout out to the staff here- we will be back.",

Bless the workers on shift today, they were okay to make an exception and still let us do curbside pickup.

Super informative about the restaurant and the surrounding area. Even had the manager and another associate to stop by to to answer some of our questions. The food was delicious and the best coffee I ve had in a few weeks. We plan to head back there every morning and possibly even for lunch or dinner while we re here!",

It is a very well organised restaurant and I felt comfortable and safe throughout the restaurant. Even the bathrooms were nice unlike most places. When I tried Popeyes chicken sandwich I thought that was great, but this was beyond exceptional and both me and my taste buds think that this food was better than anything I have tried before. I will be sure to recommend all my friends to this restaurant as they will love it as much, or more than me. Thanks, Henry!",

The food is always hot and the portions are alway generous, in most restaraunts i will tip 15 percent even if the serves is medeoker but i will admit when i leave the spot rarely do i ever leave under 30 percent and even have left as high as 75 percent and feel it was deserved, i rate this a 10 out of ten with a 11 out of 10 on the staff.",
