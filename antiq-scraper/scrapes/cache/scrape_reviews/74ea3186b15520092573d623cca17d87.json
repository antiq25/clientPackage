The food was amazing and it tasted straight out of Aleppo. I commend the chef and owner of the restaurant for bringing the quality and authenticity of Syrian food in their dishes served there.

            "review_text": "Yasma is a lovely little gem in coal harbour, slightly tucked away, just off of West Georgia right by the marina. The decor is modern, and the view is spectacular, especially because we went right as the sun set. Each dish is comfortably shared amongst 3 people, unless stated differently. The flavors are so fresh and bold. Make sure to order as much bread as you need to complete the dips and sauces. I went with a group of 10 people and spent roughly $60 per person, with 2 bottles of wine and there were left overs that we split amongst ourselves. Large groups are too big for the venue but they were so lovely by accommodating us.  The service really helped make this place stand out. This place is a great date or venue to bring your best friends, best suited for groups of 4 to 6. So dont dress too casual here, its definitely a place to look a bit more polished when you arrive.",

Very authentic and delicious food all the way from Syria and Lebanon, freshly made and tasting like nothing you ever tried before. Nice choice of salads, small mezze plates to share and something for everyone s taste. Several nice vegetarian and vegan options as well. Strongly recommend Fattoush Salad, which is just delicious, hummus is next level, fresh and yummy, and don t get me started on freshly baked pita bread. Place gets very busy on weekends, so make sure to make a booking, although if you are alone or couple, if you are lucky - you may get seated at the bar to admire amazing skills of bartender Anka, who is just doing magic there and  is very helpful and offers great advice. If you love Mediterranean food you ll be in heaven. Vegetarian options: Plenty of vegetarian/ vegan options Dietary restrictions: Food is halal, there are GF and vegetarian and vegan options Parking: Hard to find a parking slot Kid-friendliness: Yes definitely Wheelchair accessibility: Easy",

For the main course we ordered Aleppo Kebab. A kebab made of lamb meat, it was delicious and juicy. It was served with tahini yogurt sauce, roasted onions, red peppers, and parsley onions. It was a perfect match with the small pita bread that came hot and was refreshed whenever we asked for it. I chose Apricot Soda as a drink, it was fresh and tasted great, I would definitely recommend it. Also, the staff is kind and friendly. I look forward to going back many more times. Thank you!",

The food was so so so good, and as an Arab I tried many places in Canada, and this is on top of my list now. Hummus was very creamy, and with the combination of the freshly baked pita was so yummy (plus the bread keeps coming for free! Not many restaurants do this.

The flavour was on the milder side - the garlic sauce was mild, the fattoush dressing was light. I think it might depend on what you re looking for, as I like my Lebanese food to be stronger flavoured and I was missing the pomegranate punch in the fattoush salad and the strong garlic intensity in the garlic sauce. The chicken tawouk was good but on the slightly dry side. The lamb burger which was highly recommended was only ok - the meat was a bit fatty and the bun was a bit too much bread (we ended up putting the meat and toppings into their very delicious homemade pita instead - that was much better). The price point is a bit higher for this level of food but the location IS in coal harbour so this was expected. Overall, would come again but with different expectations and for specific dishes.",

Despite the restaurant being packed with eager diners, the staff maintained a warm and inviting atmosphere that instantly made us feel welcome. One staff member, in particular, stood out among the rest - Omar. From the moment we sat down his attentive nature and genuine friendliness shone through. He took excellent care of our group, ensuring that we were comfortable and had everything we needed throughout the evening. But what truly set this dining experience apart was the kindness and attentiveness exhibited by Omar. He went above and beyond to ensure we had an extraordinary time, patiently answering our questions, offering insightful suggestions and providing us with an array of delightful and mouthwatering dishes.. His passion for his work and dedication to customer satisfaction were evident in every interaction, making our evening even more memorable. Thanks to Omars exemplary service, we have found a new favorite spot in town. Without a doubt, we will be returning. Thank you, Omar, for making our evening unforgettable!",

We were checked in right away and taken to our table which was a little cozier than Id anticipated (tables close to each other) but the view made up for it. The waiters were friendly, knowledgeable and knew the menu items very well. They made any changes we asked for without any issues. The food and desserts were all very tasty and full of flavor. The cubed potatoes were very very spicy as there is fresh Thai chilies mixed in, they were so good I finished the whole thing (you can always ask for no chillies). The pricing is on point, very reasonable for what you get. The only down side is the salad (21 bucks for greens is a bit high) but I still had to try it! Needless to say it was very delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to couples and adults enjoying time together (not really Meant for kids). Over all everything was 10/10.. I will definitely return. Keep in mind you do need to call or book a table online.",

Really appreciated the person recommending the spiced potato dish to us, adding extra olive oil to our eggplant dish, and taking our photos around the restaurant. The spiced potato went so well with the Eggplant mutabbal dish we ordered. My favorite was the Aleppo kebab. The lamb kebab was cooked perfectly and it was so flavorful with the different spices they used. Also loved the charred vegetables and different salads that came with the dish. I knew very little about Mediterranean/middle eastern food, but after yesterday I have a whole new appreciation for how healthy and delicious middle eastern food is.",

It was absolutely divine! The quality, the flavor, location and ambiance was truly an amazing experience. The staff were professional and friendly even when the restaurant was full they took time to chat and provide a unique middle eastern flair to the evening. It was my first time to have Fatoush salad - amazing! Lamb - flavorful and melts in your mouth. Arabic coffee and cheese/nut pastry for dessert was a beautiful finish to such a wonderful evening. It was like going to the Middle East without leaving my backyard. Truly awesome!",

The first thing we said when we got the food was that it really felt authentic. When we finished, we said that this was one of the few times we felt like we had real Arab food in a restaurant in Vancouver. It s a little pricey but portions are good and it s a great option for a nicer dinner.

The menu is limited which is understandable given they are new and have dinner hours only right how. However, everything was delicious. Our favorite was the skewer of the day which was halloumi and lamb. The chicken was also super flavorful and they really know how to do their potatoes right. We had amazing service from Roza who made us feel very comfortablr. Cant wait to go back.",

Their baba ganoush is also very popular, the pure eggplant puree and the generous amount of pomegrate in it makes the whole texture and taste difference.

            "review_text": "Delicious food made with pride  and friendly service. We tried the hummus, lamb burger and fries, Toshka and fries. Technically the Toshka came with fries but the owner was nice enough to oblige my request to swap it for a small Tabouleh. The lamb burger was delicious. The caramelized onions and herbs really elevated it. The Toshka had tender lamb and melted halloumi cheese sandwiched inside perfectly grilled pita. I believe it had pomegranate molasses drizzled over it.  It was the perfect finish for this dish. The small tabouleh was pretty generous for a  small . It was fresh and yummy. The decor in the restaurant is tastefully done with pieces imported from Lebanon.  It has a cozy, intimate ambience. We re looking forward to coming back when they re open for dine it.",

Mariam , you deserve all the credit for making us so comfortable that we went back again. Omar never stops smiling even though he is running around all the time. My choice is never the best but I won this time. My order of Toshka was the best and Grape leaves ( I had never tasted before) were excellent. The hummus , the Baba Ghanoush, the Salad and every dish was great. Dana , the Bartender at one point came to help them and was so good. Music on Friday was a huge plus point with the food to make it a right choice. We highly recommend Yasma .",

            "review_text": "The full experience of the mediterranean . Authentic , modern, chic. From the moment I entered I was greeted warmly in the foyer by a lovely hostess . We didn t have a reservation but they happily gave us a walk in spot within 45 minutes. A very kind and generous offer considering it was mother days and we failed beforehand to make a reservation. Once inside Yasma Restaurant, my eyes were doused in visual astonishment.The design aesthetic upon entry was breathtaking. Adorned with a beautiful colour palette one would expect when visiting the mediterranean. Blues , woodsy browns and a charming hue of warm amber enchanted my eyes as I was lead to my table. Houda was our server for the evening. Impeccable , authentic hospitality. It was as if she welcomed us into her home and dining room. She presented us with our menus and indulged us on the evening specials. After, she gave us her personal recommendations of what is a must try ( quite frankly , everything on the menu is a must try in my opinion). Houda was extremely knowledgeable of the ingredients of each dish and this greatly helped in making our selections. Thank you Houda, you truly understand hospitality and how to do hosting the right way! The cocktails were divine. Expert mixologist working at the bar. A great asset to the restaurant. The flavours were spot on, balanced and just the right proportions of sweet/acidity. The dishes , upon first bite brought me to internal tears as it pierced my heart heart strings and reminded me of my Lebanese grandmothers cooking , (the cooking she made for family dinner parties). Every ounce of flavour one would hope for was present! The evening was adorned with light music by a guitarist. I felt transported to middle east.  Wonderful Syrian hospitality memory and one that will very much keep me coming back for more. Thank you for opening this culinary jewel for Vancouver. A customer for life!

The restaurants atmosphere is a tasteful nod to contemporary aesthetics, providing a sophisticated backdrop where the heritage of the cuisine can shine. The menu is thoughtfully curated, featuring a selection of dishes that are rooted in tradition yet presented with a modern flair. Each recipe is a careful composition of flavors that are indicative of the regions gastronomic legacy, such as the richly spiced lamb and the tender, grilled vegetables. Shadi, our gracious host, added an extra layer of enjoyment to our visit with his attentive service and his knack for suggesting the perfect dish to suit our tastes. The team around him was equally impressive, striking the right balance between professionalism and personal touch to make our evening at Yasma truly special. For a genuine taste of Middle Eastern hospitality with a contemporary twist, Yasma is a destination that should not be missed.

Def too much food for 2 adults and 2 kids, but completely okay with us because well happily eat everything for breakfast and lunch tomorrow! The plating is so beautiful - people actually stopped us at the beach to ask where we got our food from because it looked so good! A bit tricky to figure out the pickup, but that was mostly because we didnt read our instructions very well. Highly recommended!",

I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone; the ambience, the food and the live music were just flawless. We had the muhammara, fattoush salad, aleppo kebab and shish tawouk which were all perfectly seasoned,  in generous portions and beautifully presented. Sadly half the plates were demolished before I could take good photos!  My middle eastern mother who herself is a great cook,  was left impressed! The highlight of the night was having a qatayif and Lebanese coffee whilst listening to Um Kulthum... cant really get better than that. Will definitely be back when Im in Vancouver again and being more family!",
