            "review_text": "Review for Hungry Guys in Vancouver Had the pleasure of stumbling upon this cozy Mexican-themed bar & restaurant while shopping around Vancouver on vacation. I was initially drawn in by their enticing drink specials   $3.49 shots including choices like Jose Cuervo tequila, Malibu coconut rum, Fireball cinnamon whiskey, and both red and blue kamikazes. They didnt just win me over with their drink menu; their food options seemed diverse and delectable. I had just finished eating, but I had watched several other patrons, absolutely devour their tacos and burgers, and they look really good!!! The ambiance is warm and welcoming, with rustic countertops, soft seating, and high ceilings that give a spacious feel to the intimate setting. One of the standout features was the partially open kitchen; its always reassuring to see a clean and well-maintained culinary space. I saw staff constantly making aa cleanliness effort. Tayanne was my server for most of the evening, and her friendly demeanour made me feel as if I was catching up with an old friend. Later, Vesa took over, ensuring the service quality remained impeccable. The presence of an attentive manager overseeing operations added an extra layer of professionalism. For solo travellers like myself or anyone for that matter, this spot guarantees comfort and a fantastic dining experience. If youre out shopping at Marshalls, Sephora, or any nearby  luxe  stores and fancy a reasonably priced meal/snack or quick drink, I highly recommend this gem. It s a wonderful place to unwind, whether you choose the bar or a comfy table. Cheers to a memorable experience! Vegetarian options: Veggie burger! Tofu spicy rice bowl! Caesar  salad, avocado taco salad with tofu",

I know people may say $7 a taco is a lot but for real, IT WAS WORTH IT. I stumbled across this place by chance just walking a couple blocks from my hotel and I was immediately in love. Even though I wasn t able to get a picture of my rapidly consumed food. I managed to get a photo of the inside of the facility. I was absolutely amazed by the lights and the fact all their ceiling plants are real! SO amazed in fact, that I came home and recreated the restaurant vibe in my hallway *also with real plants!* (See photo)",

I suspect the waitress thought there was a communication issue when I ordered only churros and a mojito as she called another fellow (owner or manager?) to assist her.  I hadnt tried tequila yet and mistakenly thought it was the liquor in mojitos.  The staff gently and patiently corrected me, redirecting me to a margarita instead. Churros were cooked perfectly: slightly crunchy yet still pleasantly soft.  They came with generous amounts of both creamy chocolate sauce and real whipping cream on the side, both of which had leftovers when I finished. Thankfully this location is a close walk from home so I will be returning again to sample some other menu choices - and maybe a mojito next time.",

Whether you get a Burrito, Rice Bowl, Salad, or even sometimes theyll offer Soups or Mac&Cheese; its the ideal lunch. Their food doesnt seem to have any / many preservatives which is A-Mazing. Ive never seen them serve anything that wasnt 100% fresh; meaning its great for To Go as well. All in all, one of my favorite places to eat when Im downtown. :)",
