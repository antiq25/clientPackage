I had tried their beers before and knew they were good, but I was blown away by the size and style of their brewing facility. It was massive yet very sleek and stylish. I loved the tasting room and sampled several of their beers, leaving me satisfied. I also bought some glassware to take home, and I use it often. I want to revisit this brewery as they update the tap quite often. Thanks for the great experience, Superflux!",

There s also lots of plants for the indoor houseplant lover to gaze at (check out their gigantic birds of paradise!). They have gourmet hotdogs ($13+) if you re hungry and happy hour beer+hotdog combos on weekdays. Fave beer is the Jellystone; hazy IPA, a tinge of sweetness, so easy to drink. Also bought the canned Pretty Much Yeah to drink at home and didn t love it as much. Superflux Lager is super easy to drink. Also had Happyness, a West Coast IPA. Definitely recommend the Jellystone if hazy is your thing.",

But I digress. Its all about the beer. I had the Jellystone, which was very juicy, almost like a pineapple juice. But a very fresh and refreshing summer drink. Loads of flavour and goes down easy. Low on the bitters, even palatable for a non-beer drinker. Same goes for the Colour and Shape, which my wife ordered. I felt that one was slightly more muted than the Jellystone, and closer to a summer beer. Very enjoyable. The vibe of the place was very chill. Dog friendly, and great service. They know the drinks well and are able to recommend something thatll work for you.",

You simply cannot go wrong: if you showed up hungry and didn t leave sated, you messed up. - The music. Whomever is choosing the playlists  needs to win an award. It s all the deep cuts. All the nostalgic hits. All the things. - If you happen to come in when Dennis is around, a standard 10/10 Superflux visit gets a rare 11/10 grade because Dennis is one of the best humans in the city. Summary: Come for the beer. Stay for the bangin  playlist. Revel in just how darned great each and every personality attached to Flux is.",

Superflux has been around for years, originally brewing out of Strathcona, a few blocks away. Their bread and butter offering is hazy IPA. In my opinion, they can do no wrong. The only things I haven t liked are their take on a stout, cream soda, and coconuts IPA. Otherwise their repertoire of NE IPA & NW IPA are great. Collabs, great! They did a Pilsner with four winds, also great! Diablo cookie inspired collab with Tacofino, you guessed it... also great! Looking forward to the tasting room, but for now I m super happy to have a HUGE supply of their rotating favourites in the neighbourhood. Check them out!",

Loved their hazy ipas (velvetone, color & shape, pretty much yeah). Like the 3 different pour sizes. They do not offer flights. - service: 4.5 stars. Staff was friendly, responsive, actively kept our alcoholic and non-alcoholic glasses full. We experienced one minor, negative incident while waiting outside however, hence not 5 stars. There was no queue and their covid info signage (outside) instructed to come inside if there is no line, so we did. But one staff member asked us to then go outside and asked us to  read the sign , as he thought this was mentioned in the signage. He repeated the quoted statement twice which I felt was condescending and unnecessary. Then I pointed out to him that the instructions are different from what he said, which he then accepted and apologized. - ambiance: 5 stars. Decoration was minimal, nice, and clean. Lot of seating. Restroom was clean. - parking: no dedicated spots that we could locate but street parking available. - covid measures: good, staff wore mask, had sanitization stations.",
