Vegetables, soups, noodles with lamb or chicken, and even fried rice are so tasty. The broth is both light and full of flavors. The music isn t too loud and the people are very nice.

The star of the show was 100% the noodles, hand pulled noodles are super unique in texture and these certainly delivered. The soup were really nice and light, accompanied by good amount of green onions and cilantro. Would strongly recommend the spicy option as it as another level of depth to the soup.",

She was very friendly and it was very insightful to learn a bit about the background of the restaurant, including part of her personal journey and the history behind the food we were being served. When ordering, you get to choose the thickness and style the hand-made noodles you ll be eating! And you can also see how they are done through the open window of the kitchen. Our food was served soon after we ordered, with a beautiful presentation that was just a glimpse of how good it was going to taste. My Dan Dan noodles were delicious! Creamy and with just the right balance of spiciness! This place is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and MUST if you are in the neighborhood!",

The first few noodle dishes are combos and come with cold dishes which are posted in the back. In addition the first column are all soup dishes and the second dry noodle dishes. It would be helpful to deliniate all of these choices with different headers. The food itself was awesome and so good! There are a ton of choices for their hand pulled noodles. You can get them extra thon, thin, normal, wide, or extra wide and you can watch them hand pull the noodles thanks to a large mirror into the kitchen. A lot of my family got their traditional beef noodle soup which was pretty good. I got their dry noodles with lamb and knife cut noodles which are super thick and chewy (which I loved). The dish itself was a bit salty though. Of note, the spice that goes into the noodle soups has peanuts which was good to know since my brothers have peanut allergies ): The other picture is a piece of beef roll (they come cut into four pieces). Also delicious.",

The best combo of noodle type and it s dishes is that for the soup, ask for thin noodles (not extra thin); and for the lamb dish ask for the Dao Xiao Mian type (the noodle master uses his  flying sword  to cut the noodles). #3 dish is the most authentic one I have found in the downtown neighborhood. It has a tiny taste of numb spice. #11 uses cumin to cook the lamb and noodles. Their noodle master is on the same level as Ding Tai Feng. Their decoration wall uses the Paitings from Dun Huang MoGao Craves, first caves were dug out in AD 366 as places of Buddhist meditation and worship.",

I ordered a Chilli Oil Noodles; such a big portion that I couldn t finish it. They packed them up for me to bring home, and I was tempted to eat them up upon I got home. My son had a traditional beef noodles, with extra thin noodles; you can t believe they were hand-pulled, as thin as your hair. Beautiful taste, freshly made-on-spot noodles, friendly service; highly recommend!",

Being a North western Chinese, I was touched by its authenticity because I dont see many good Chinese restaurants in downtown. Then I ordered beef wrap and lamb carrot dumpling. To be honest I always find the dumplings in Vancouver to be somewhat not delicious so I didnt have that much expectation for it, but this one is really good, its tasty and comfy food. I also like the apricot sweet desert - it has a piece of apricot and Chinese hawberry, again, I really like it.  The side dishes are simple but flavory.  The tea is special, the flavor is light but pleasant. I feel like they dont just run it as a business, they care about the food they deliever. In addition, the environment is clean and the owner is very friendly. During the whole time of dining, i kept saying so good or the service is good to my friend. I mean, everyone has their preference about food but for me, for what I ordered, i was impressed and definitely will go again! Good experience :)",

You can also ask for their homemade chili sauce to dip your meats into. Had a really good meal here and might visit again",

            "review_text": "OK.... so where to start.   First thing is, I almost missed this place because of 3 fake reviews, and one unfair on their opening day. This place is amazing.  Authentic Lanzhou noodles.   100%Legit.  The wife says they are better than she had there.   After our meal we talked with the owner and she told us that her family has over 60  restaurants across generations in Lanzhou.  She brought their expertise and flavor here. She is extremely friendly, and has pored her heart and soul into this place. We were actually lucky to get in here.  We were 3 minutes late for the place down the street, which shall remain nameless, and Im actually glad we got turned away. I didnt realize that Noodle Arts closes for the sane interval as Density down the street (name changed to protect the sheeple xiao long bao place).  Not only did the owner and others take our order, they stayed almost an hour past their closing time, and never even said a word.   The other place would have attacked us with pitchforks, cleavers, broken bottles and chopsticks to get us to leave by 3:01.   OK, maybe I exaggerate..... they wouldnt use chopsticks. Go figure, but Noodle Arts has amazing noodles, and everything is first rate (top ingredients). Anything with flour is hand pulled.  Thin to thick, flat or shaved.... its all great. The pan-fried dumplings were loaded with meat/filling and possibly the best Ive had.  We went back to the sheeple place after I posted this review, and their pan-fried soup dumplings, the rolled fried dumplings, and the regular fried dumplimgs were all extremely inferior to Noodle Arts. And at the other place, we were in our seat at least 45 minutes before their siesta, and they rushed to get us to put in our complete order.  We asked that they give us the dessert (chocolate & yummy) dumplings last...... and they said of coirse..no problem.   Guess what came out first?  No problem was out the window, and we were stuck with dessert dumplings waiting for us..... almost as inpatiently as the workers. If you are in Vancouver and looking for Chinese, dont miss this place.  Skip the line down the street, and come here.  You can order chocolate dumplings later. Also, Nikka, who apparently has been with them since the beginning, is a great server.  Very attentive and a pleasure to deal with.  Young, but an extremely intense listener, and observer.  Not Chinese, but she is definitely one of the most customer oriented servers I met while in  Canada. To the Yelp moderators.....  get rid of the fake reviews.  I would tell Yelp, but they dont seem to care when Trolls attack restaurants... BOO",
