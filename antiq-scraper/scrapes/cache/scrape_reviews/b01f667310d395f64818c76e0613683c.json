Parking is great in the area if youre driving, with two parking lots in the area. The pricing for portion is fairly priced, really good value. No public washroom, so make sure you take care of business before coming down. Staff are friendly, and offer great suggestions. Highly recommend as a must stop in the area.",

Extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and skilled. Our bartender put on a good performance with the other bartender when mixing drinks and they work harmoniously together. -Drinks: Each drink has a story and was very well thought out. We tried 4 drinks that night and we will be back to try more! Each drink was also very special and in my personal opinion the best bar Ive been to in Canada. *note* they do not allow usage of cameras in this place, but you can keep your phone in your jacket/purse.",

            "review_text": "First of all this little kiosk of a place that sells dumplings looked amazing!  WTF ?  Get outta here! It looked like an old fashioned Chinatown stalk from the 30 s but really cool and hipsterized.  Something my grandfather would have liked back in those days when he owned property accross the street which he sold for $2000.  A very long time ago.  I loved the concept.  A polite non Asian woman was tending the front of shop and I found out I could order frozen dumplings   for takeaway.  I can t remember the price but it wasn t cheap, but remember thinking they re handmade so should be good.  Asked which ones she liked which was option four, The Zhong (see picture of menu).  I asked if ok to take some photos and we got our little frozen gems which we used for our hotpot dinner at home.   TBH I was wondering if they would be a letdown but we were all surprised they held up well in the hotpot and you know what?  They tasted great.  Wasn t sure about the thick skin but that was the wrapping bonus because they were chewy and held up to the drenches of the rolling boiling hotpot soup and the tumbling abuses it got being stirred about and overcooked.  These were some hearty dumplings!  Best of all they were locally made and not some frozen factory made from overseas with sceptical ingredients.  I hope.   So A plus for these dumplings! But wait.  Nooooo way! It s a speakeasy? If you only knew the expletives that was shouting from my brain so early in the morning as I thumb this review on my smartphone. Now I have another reason to come here.  Ok sure one dude wrote he didn t have good customer service and another said the dumplings were chewy and the wrapper too thick.  To them I say Hah!!! Whatever.  I m just gonna enjoy the experience of it all.  Because regardless of that, I ve had and been through way way worse when I lived in Chinatown and this is a treat.  ( as long as I can afford it). If I were as young as these reviewers they d understand more of being appreciative for places like this that are revitalizing my childhood haunts.  Bringing back some mystery and life back into these buildings that have lived such amazing lives.  So the next time you come to Chinatown day or evening.  Dare to drop in here.  Experience something new that is so old with open eyes.  Don t be a stuffed up Millennial or Gen Z foodie know it all.  Just enjoy and live the experience and remember where we all came from.  Humble roots.",

Took my girlfriend and one of our roomates (who happens to be Asian) and we had an amazing time, the drinks and service were top notch and the idea of a speakeasy in today s times just feels cool. Conceptually this spot totally sets itself apart from the majority of big business dining experiences, and provides something new/unique that will only serve to further elevate the Vancouver restaurant scene. I have gotten to known one of the owners over the past few years and have had the pleasure of witnessing this project slowly form into what it is now.. it has truly been a labour of love for him and so impressive getting to see it come to life. On another note, I am very disappointed that people feel the need to attack new businesses starting up/pull the gentrification card, especially during the current economic climate for the hospitality industry. The owners have a great respect for the culture and the neighbourhood they have chosen for their venue. How is it fair to discredit and insult small business owners because their business doesn t reflect their skin colour? Would it be more acceptable if it were a sandwich shop? By that logic I guess an Asian person isn t allowed to run an Italian restaurant.. and maybe the Szechuan lettuce wraps/sushi rolls/poke bowls should be pulled from the menu at cactus club et al  Entrepreneurs and chefs should have the freedom to cook and serve and decorate however they feel like without small minded people putting them down. I would 100% recommend checking out this spot, and I hope people take these unfortunate negative reviews with a proper grain of salt.. check it out in person and make your own decision. Prepare to be blown away!",

Its a cool, vibey atmosphere that Vancouver desperately needs more of! The dumpling bar is a new lunch favourite for sure. Lets also remember to give a little grace to restaurants right now, especially new ones opening after 16 months of lockdowns and restrictions. We should all be doing our best to support the small businesses that give life to our neighbourhoods :)",
