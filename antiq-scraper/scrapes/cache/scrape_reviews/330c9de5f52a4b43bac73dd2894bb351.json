Refused to put items through insurance claiming they did not have a prescription. This was parts of a larger order and when asked, from the Dr. Providing the prescription, they indicated it was obvious the patient had enough information on the original prescription to process such a request and that they never heard of itemizing a prescription in this manner.  Wanted to send a vulnerable individual to walk in clinics to wait with other sick people for hours when pharmacies can prescribe themselves for clear low level issues such as this.  Also filled the rest of the prescription with other drugs know and clearly indicated to treat same issue.  Either, they do not give any care to the overall health of a person, or they don t know what they re prescribed drugs do.  Went somewhere else and was able to easily get this corrected.",

The worst customer service I ever experienced especially from the older lady with long gray hair. She was very rude and unprofessional. One time she gave me my usual prescription in a half size smaller box and charging me full price. I tried to explain her that this is not correct and she wasnt even able to listen to me. I went home garbed my old box with my old receipt and went back to prove it. She wasnt there and someone else who helped me found out that second half of my prescription was forgotten to give me. If she was able to listen this would never happen. Most common issue I have when I come to pick it up, it is not ready even though I gave them few extra days. When I come they act like I have ever placed the order and they dont have it in record and they have to order something and start over. If it happened once, OK but it happens every time for over 3 years. How is that even possible? When I told her what had happen to me last time, he kept saying NO, like she could change what already happened and is not able to listen at all. Yes people have bad days but I think she hates her job and her life. I am changing the pharmacy because this service is not going  to change. If her boss was her customer she would be fired in a minute. There are overall issues with the logistics of the pharmacy but her attitude is makes everything even worst.",

I went there at 9 am they just opened and they told me 30 mins I asked if my medication was ready when the time has passed and still they said they were working on it. So disappointed . They should hire more staff or do something about this problem . Other pharmacies have the medication ready in 15 or 20 mins.",

I was told that they couldnt fill my prescription because it doesnt exist (i know it does as ive had it before) and then told my prescription was wrong and to just come in  then told to go somewhere else. I dont know how they can operate a successful business this way. I phoned at 9:20pm on monday dec 11th.",
