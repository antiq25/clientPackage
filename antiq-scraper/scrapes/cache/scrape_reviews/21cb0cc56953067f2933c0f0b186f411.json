Happy Hour ~ I had the mac and cheese that was amazing. -Perfect balance between rich cheese flavors and a satisfyingly gooey texture.   Pairing this delightful dish with a flight of craft beers is a match made in heaven. -The server knew we had a long day and just wanted to talk, so they made sure we had our space to talk without interrupting. The inside was a lot bigger than I thought and had an outside patio as well. -Would come back and recommend though I do wish their happy hour served more options or a bit of later happy hour window.",

There s cool art hanging around for sale and amazing (rock) music. Saltys the lobster shack is the restaurant portion of this brewery and the lobster rolls are AMAZING. We ordered a grilled cheese, a Maine (cold) lobster roll full order and a half order lobster roll with bisque that came with a huge chunk of lobster! Everything was delicious albeit a tad salty but thats okay, I just drank more beer ;) Beers here were pretty good! I tried the jasmine rice beer (same one sold at the Lunch Lady, a highly recommended Vietnamese restaurant on Commercial) which was very light, and also the Hef. Would try their pale ale next time when we re back! Saltys had last call just before 8pm on Sunday but the brewery still serves snacks (like sausages) afterwards so just a heads up! Will definitely come back!",

The food was delicious, service was excellent and went the extra mile with an issue that happened after I had left the premises. I was presented the incorrect bill unbeknownst to me, most likely due to a staff shift change. Which I absent mindedly paid without verifying since it was an E-bill via a tablet. I did reflect on it later after seeing the bank confirmation sms, but didnt bring it up with East Van. They actually had noticed it later also and had already issued a refund which I got on Friday. I never brought it to their attention, they went ahead and did the right thing. Thats honest, top tier service right there! The gesture was very much appreciated!",

The beers here seem not those fruity flavoured brews or ultra hoppy IPAs...plenty of places already serve that demand well. Here, what they have are excellent (what I would term) traditional ales...not as hoppy, darker brews. And theyre really, really good: the kind of flavours youre likely to taste in the UK (though obviously served at North American temperatures....sigh). Though I live in Port Moody, walking distance from brewers row EVB is my go to place to fill the growlers. The vibe here is great: down a few steps (theres a handy elevator for those less mobile) and with a few mates it definitely reminded me of some bars in London....sink a few pints*, grab a snack and sit down for a few hours of banter. My only issue are the pints (hence the *). I really hope that EVB move to using proper pint glasses instead of what I think are more like sleeves. Every time I grab a beer Im thinking I REALLY wish youd serve me a proper pint and not this short measure #nomoreshortpints Otherwise, well worth a visit. Take your empty growlers and fill up too.",
