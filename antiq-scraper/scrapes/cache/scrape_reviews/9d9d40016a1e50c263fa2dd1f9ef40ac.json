When I couldnt find the desired 24 x 48 corrugated plastic sheets due to their unavailability, Scott came to my rescue. Despite only having larger 48 x 96 sheets in stock, he willingly offered to cut one in half for me, even though I didnt have any tools with me. Scotts helpfulness was refreshing, especially after encountering three other unhelpful employees. As my young daughter astutely pointed out, Scott was the only staff member who made us feel truly welcome. The management team at Home Depot should acknowledge and appreciate employees like Scott, as his outstanding customer service sets an example for his peers to follow.",

Anselmo was very professional as were his crew.  He was very polite and helpful with the choosing of wall color.  They worked quickly and efficiently finishing in a very timely manner as well as giving us a fair and honest price. We would highly recommend them for your all your paint jobs and will also  be recommending them to all our friends. Thank you Liz",

All the departments have pretty much everything you need and more for any type of thing around the house. The staff are knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and professional. Parking lot is always tidy and a lot of parking stalls, never had to take anytime to search for one. Great prices as well, and they will price match if a different store has the same product but cheaper.",

They were great about the refund, no hassle. I was disappointed and so they offered to price match a similar model that they had in-stock. The ones they had in-stock were not what I wanted so I declined the offer. Alexander was awesome at really empathizing with my situation and I honestly felt he did everything he could to resolve the issue so I could leave as a satisfied customer.

I used to occasionally buy paint from  this store years ago  but was never thrilled about it. The last time I was in, I was so impressed by the assistance from the group of gentleman that were working. Fred, Taylor and the Behr paints gentleman (I m sorry I can t remember his name) were so warm and funny. It was a truly special experience and one I sadly don t usually receive from customer service stores anymore but wow, they really went above and beyond with helping me choose the right products and offered unbiased opinions. other stores should take a lesson from what excellent service looks like as I will certainly be coming back regularly. Thank you Burnaby Home Depot Paint!",

I had already visited 2 competitor stores, and they seemed to carry cordless only.  Since I already owned 2 cordless, including one of the coveted and expensive Dysons, which lasts 10 minutes from fully charged to a sudden zero; then a subsequent 2 hours to charge and then another 10 minutes of working.  Jay  checked the department and found only cordless, but concluded that some corded machines were available online.  To confirm this, she checked with  Sarah  from that department. I was already happy to return home to order. Jay then said that she would check online to ensure that it was in stock. It was indeed, and since she had the product on the screen, informed me that I could order it then and there,  if I wanted to, and have it delivered free of charge to my home.  Jay started the order, and Sarah completed it.  I was impressed with 2 staff members going out of their way to make sure that I had what I wanted.  Thank you, Jay and Sarah!",

He did all this while also helping out a group of probably five other customers waiting and was calm and professional throughout.
