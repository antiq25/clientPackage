            "review_text": "My friends and I had the pleasure of dining at Zab Bite restaurant, a gem of a Thai restaurant in town. From the moment we stepped in, the ambiance set the stage for what was an unforgettable evening. The decor, an elegant blend of traditional Thai elements and modern touches, created a welcoming and lively atmosphere. The service was exceptional. Our server was knowledgeable, attentive, and had great suggestions for our diverse group. We started with Assorted Appetizers, Veggie spring rolls, crispy pork toast, shrimp wrap, and pork jerky. Each dish was a hit, perfectly balanced in flavors and textures. The main courses were a delightful journey through Thai cuisine. The green curry with chicken was rich and aromatic, with just the right level of spice. The Pad Thai was simply the best Ive ever had, with a perfect blend of sweet, sour, and great flavors. We also tried a lesser-known dish, Khao Soi, which was a revelation with its creamy coconut curry and tender noodles. What truly made the night special was the shared joy of exploring these flavors with friends. The portions were generous, ideal for sharing, and it sparked lively conversations and shared laughter. To end the meal, we indulged in mango sticky rice and Thai iced tea, which were the perfect sweet notes to conclude a fantastic meal. In summary, Zab Bite restaurant is not just about extraordinary Thai food; it s about the experience of sharing delicious, well-crafted dishes with good company in a beautiful setting. It s a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy Thai cuisine at its best. A solid 5 stars for the amazing food, ambiance, and service. Cant wait to return!",

Personally I love spicy so much and this Thai restaurant uses real dried chilies. It makes our food more flavorful. But you can ask them for mild spicy as well. Reasonable price. Our waiter was very kind and polite. I m looking forward to coming back to Zab bite again. Highly recommend Kor moo yang!!",

The rice has a slight saltiness to balance the sweetness and creaminess. Texture is 9.5/10. The crispy topping definitely adds more texture to it. I grew up in Thailand and I tell you that this taste is exactly what I had at home. I ve tried many Thai restaurants and around here and I can enjoy most of them but can t say they re authentic. They also have local Thai drinks that you won t find anywhere else in Vancouver.",

The standout feature of this restaurant is the flavorful Thai cuisine. The dishes were undeniably tasty, and I found myself savoring every bite. I d like to make a special mention of the Khao Soi, the curry noodles. While it was delicious, I thought it could benefit from a bit more broth to make it truly exceptional. The staff at Zab Bite were incredibly friendly and attentive throughout our meal, which added to the pleasant atmosphere. The restaurant itself had a fresh, new look, and it s evident that they ve put effort into creating an inviting space. Personal favorites are important, and mine at Zab Bite has to be the Somtum Pla Ra. It s a must-try for anyone who appreciates authentic Thai flavors.if you like thai anchovy sauce",

I love Esan food : like unique presented taste and menus from Thailands northeast region. I really love how they re  present Thai foods in their signature way. We ordered : Som tum Khao Pod with salted egg (Recommended) This dish is my fav from Thailand. And here not disappointed me and make me feel that I am in Thailand. It very good combination with corn, tomato, green bean, carrot and roasted peanuts in sour & spicy dressing. Plus salted eggs. Seriously One order not enough for me. (Spicy level is optional) Pad see Iew : If you love stir fried/fresh rice medium thick noodle / Gailan vegetables/ eggs and meat. This dish Must try. How they create all combinations with sauce is so delicious  for me. Right amount of sauce and right temperature rice noodle cooking with cooked gailan. Num tok  Korea moo yang : this dish was present with authentic way same in Thailand. If you in love with spicy. Please don t missed. They brought Thailand to here. Don t forget to order sticky rice (variety of cultivated short-grain rice grown  that becomes  sticky when cooked) forc eating  with it. Will visit you again soon",

From start to finish, the experience was nothing short of exceptional. First and foremost, the food at Zab Bite is an absolute delight for the taste buds. The menu boasts an impressive array of Thai dishes, each bursting with authentic flavors and fresh ingredients. Whether youre a fan of classic Pad Thai, a spice enthusiast craving some Tom Yum soup, or looking for something more adventurous like their signature pineapple fried rice, Zab Bite has you covered. Every dish I tried was a symphony of flavors that transported me straight to Thailand. The ambiance of the restaurant is charming and cozy, making it the perfect spot for a date night or a gathering with friends and family. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, ensuring that we felt welcome and well taken care of throughout our meal. What truly sets Zab Bite apart is their commitment to authenticity. The chefs use traditional Thai cooking techniques and spices, resulting in dishes that are not only delicious but also true to their cultural roots. Its evident that the team at Zab Bite is passionate about delivering an authentic Thai dining experience, and they excel in doing so. I must also mention their vegetarian and vegan options, which are plentiful and just as scrumptious as their meat counterparts. As a vegetarian, I appreciate a restaurant that goes the extra mile to cater to diverse dietary preferences. In conclusion, Zab Bite is a gem in Vancouvers culinary scene. If youre a Thai cuisine enthusiast or someone looking to explore the flavors of Thailand, I highly recommend paying a visit to this fantastic restaurant. Its an experience you wont forget, and I cant wait to return for more of their mouthwatering dishes. Zab Bite has certainly earned its spot on my list of favorite dining spots in the city!",

My top 3 most favorite dishes must be their Kor Moo Yang, Som Tum Thai with salted egg, and Boat Noodle! These are just some of the example but other dishes are also incredibly and authentically delicious! Its on the pricy side but definitely worth it. This is the Thai place I have been waiting for in Vancouver!",

My wife grew up in Thailand so we eat a lot of Thai food at home and on the road. Zab Bite blew my expectations out of the water. The sticky rice was so soft like fresh rice from the fields in Thailand, the jeow dipping sauce gave me literal shivers lol, the beef is high quality and again tastes just like Thailand. My wife had the Pad Thai set and she says it brings her back to Thailand. The service was great which was nice considering it s so new and usually takes some months to get things in order. The price was more than fair for the size of the portions. And the cleanliness was spot on. Honestly, I can t come up with a single negative thing to say about this place .",
