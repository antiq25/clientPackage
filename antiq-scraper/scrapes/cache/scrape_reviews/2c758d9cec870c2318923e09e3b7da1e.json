The duration of the course was scintillating, energizing and a great balance of learning, discussion, hands-on, and theory. Wonderful for all learner types. The take home readings were enlightening and informative. Myorei is a wonderful teacher and I am excited to learn more from her in future courses. I strongly recommend!",

We are now doing our daily Reiki session at home and personally I feel my energy more balance. Merci Myorei for showing us the way.",
