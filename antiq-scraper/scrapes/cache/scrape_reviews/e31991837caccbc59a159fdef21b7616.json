Come by with friends where the food will definitely be as good if not better than the company and conversation. I loved the vibe is family style and inviting, doesnt pretend to be super fancy where you can be comfortable to be you and still enjoy the flavours as it was meant.

The restaurant later got very busy .Atmosphere was cozy and with good vibe. Our server Blanka was friendly and attentive . We ordered the testing menu and it blew our mind .  The testing menu is speically made for each table. Service asked a few questions and selected a special menu by the chef. Food was delicious and we enjoyed it so much . The price was reasonable. We definitely will come back again and high recommended.",

It made the experience so unique and the fish was fried perfectly and tasted so delightful. At first I thought the pasta was pretty plain but it had great flavour! Definitely recommend the fish though I was glad we got that over a steak since steaks are so common at many tasting menus. Thank you for a great first time experience! Sorry my photos are terrible and I didn t get a photo of the appy and dessert.",

Along with passing out the standard menus, the waitress read out the days specials. I selected the lemony tortellini from the normal menu, along with the featured arugula salad.  I also had a glass of water for starters.  Together, the food was delicious, and the serving sizes were perfect.  Additionally, the waitress was cordial, attentive, and made sure my service experience was excellent. I had a wonderful, exceptional eating experience, which much improved my evening after a difficult birthday night the day before.  Id love to revisit Savio Volpe to try their Alla Famiglia and/or their green spaghetti sometime. Vegetarian options: My chosen menu items happened to be vegetarian.",

The feature pasta dish was cooked perfectly and the flavours always poppin. A note here: even though we asked for no seafood/fish they accidentally brought us a vegetable dish with fish but they quickly remedied it by bringing us a different vegetable which was SO GOOD. (dragon tongue beans with prosciutto crumble, picture below) PLUS they gave us a complimentary little dessert which was a delight and of course all anniversaries get a little flute of bubbly! Honestly, even though they re a family of restaurants and cafes, I think this one is truly the favourite for me!",

We ordered the chef selection set menu and it was really cool how we could tell them what we preferred to eat (eg. preference for chicken over beef, more cheesy dishes, etc). Every dish we had was pretty top tier delicious. My absolute favourite was the burrata appetizer - so creamy and truly a cheese lover s dream! Only issue we had was the tables were too close to other tables and it felt like 2 other parties were sitting with us on our date lol. It didn t feel very private and was kind of crammed in that way. Otherwise, thanks for the amazing hospitality",

Spiritually I cannot give less than 5 stars for food if I feel the food is really a 4.5, steelhead dish had a crispy skin that was more over-charred but the flesh was tender and perfect. The burratta and blueberry dish and the beet salad with oranges were both excellent starters and we scarfed them down. The Massimo negroni I had was fantastic, vegan amaretto sour was alright but maybe ask if they have real ones instead next time, something about the texture and flavour compared to a regular one left something to be desired. Yeehaw for vegans though.",

Throughout our dinning experience it almost felt like we re having a 5 star dinner at home as we felt very comfortable enjoying all the amazing food and savouring each dish. The flavours were amazing. I m so happy to say that each dish we had was so pleasing to the palate. That we all had to sigh and moan lol while eating each dish. We ordered the family style  Alla Famiglia  and there s 5 of us to share and truly enjoyed this experience. Our server Rob was excellent as he always checked how we re doing and very knowledgeable about each dish. I highly recommend to go ahead and try it out to truly experience something spectacular.",

We went with the Dine Alla Famiglia where you let the restaurant decide your menu for you and it was so worth it.  Every dish was so delicious and it just kept getting better and better.  Highly recommend the kale salad and the Spaghetti and pea tip pistou, they were awesome.  They also had a special gnocchi dish thats not on the menu and it was packed with flavour.

The presentation of the dishes was impeccable, reflecting the restaurants commitment to both taste and aesthetics. The ambiance, with warm lighting and rustic decor, added to the overall experience.

The dining atmosphere was exceptionally intimate and the front of house staff were always prepared, anticipating our needs. Our server, Simon, was so friendly and considerate of our dietary needs as halal/pescatarians and he quickly simplified the menu for us so it was much easier to understand the items and decide what we liked. The Bagna cauda was hot and delicious and we also noticed the servers carefully crafting the times of the upcoming dishes to enhance the dining experience. We always enjoy trying the new seasonal pasta fresca and the preseved lemon tortelloni had alot of new creamy flavors for our pallets. The dishes at Savio Volpe are fairly inclusive and next time wed like to dive into more of the fish/seafood options instead of staying strictly vegetarian. We are definitely coming back in the upcoming weeks to explore the dessert menu and just want to congratulate management/staff for running this efficient and delicious restaurant that we are excited to return to again.

Every single course was an explosion of different flavors and thing we never would have thought to order for ourselves but were so thrilled they were served to us. We were absolutely stuffed by the end of our meal and both agreed that though the price is on the higher end it actually felt like an excellent value for the quality and quantity of what we were served.

You should reserve your table in advance which may be weeks in advance especially if you re more than two. I also noticed couples who find a place without booking it. Seating area is so nice with nice atmosphere. But if you re not that slim, you may feel tight seating space. Waitresses are helpful and many will help to serve you. As it was our first time we order familia order where they choose food for you and you can order it for 4 or 5 persons and food will be enough. It was so nice to have some plates that you don t know what are they. Once a plate is added , they explain to you the content and what they call it. Then you start share it together. Family order consist of 2 appetisers, 2 salads, 2 different pastas, 2 main dishes, 2 sides, and two deserts. All are tasting nice and the whole experience was great.",

But that is understandable as the food here is not bad and the prices are expensive, but still within reason for decent Italian food. The appetizer and sides were delicious, I absolutely loved the way that the asparagus was cooked and seasoned, while the appetizer we got was really good, the only suggestion I have for that is to make the croutons softer and it would be a perfect dish. The entrees were quite flavourful and the textures of the meat and noodles were perfect, my main complaint I have is that both of those dishes were too salty. Although, I really appreciated the server addressed and remedied the issue for us. The roasted strawberry gelato was absolutely fantastic and I would definitely recommend it. Overall, this was a nice restaurant and I would revisit.",

First thing that hits you when you walk in is the noise level, extremely loud, almost as if everyone is yelling at the top of their lungs. Consistent noise decibels cant be good for your hearing. The second smack in the face is that the seating arrangements are almost on top of each other, wouldnt recommend a romantic evening unless its just for the food. Waiter was prompt, explaining all the off menu specials, alot to digest before making a decision. Very willing to answer any questions on the menu items. Started off with the prosciutto appetizer and endive anchovy salad.  The presentation were both works of art and top quality ingredients blended to create a distinct flavor profile.  Prosciutto and anchovies were fresh and extremely flavorful. Main dishes, pappardalle w/ oxtail and the features deboned rainbow trout. Pappardalle was al dente Rainbow trout was cooked perfectly, texture and taste superb well complimented with the lemon butter, parsley, etc Ended with a nice cannoli for dessert Although the atmosphere was not to my personal preference, the food made up for it.",

Our waistbands were popping by the time the 4th course arrived. But we couldnt help but continue our meal, it was all so delicious. Would highly recommend the chefs choice ($75pp) as it was a great value and was fun to guess what might come out next (all dishes were from the menu). The wine was also excellent, and even though we were stuffed, ordered espresso which rivalled the coffee weve had in Italy. Overall a spectacular experience and great service to boot.

We ordered the Alla Famiglia, where the chefs surprise you with your multi-course meal experience. The server will ask about any allergies and dietary food restrictions, as well as any ingredients that you dont like. All the course items were delicious, but we especially enjoyed the prosciutto starter and our two mains of pappardelle and veal. Each prosciutto bite paired nicely with the pears, cheese and balsamic vinegar. The pappardelle had a rich ragu sauce that was spicy and slightly sour from the pickled cabbage. The veal was juicy and the accompanying bed of polenta was delicious as well. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant, and the servers were incredibly attentive and detailed with the explanation of each dish. We will definitely be coming back here in the future!",

The amount of food was decent for us and id say good for most people. We only had dinner than night so it would have been hard to stuff us.

Our server, I think his name was Nate, was so lovely and hilarious, and it really made the experience of the food so much better. Ive been to fancy restaurants where the service is extremely formal and professional, and I find that almost detracts from the dining experience, so Im glad the service here was more laid back. Honestly, my friend and I were comparing this place, and the whole experience, to Michelin Star restaurants weve been to in France and NYC... and this place easily competes, and perhaps even outcompetes a few of them. I read some reviews saying the portion sizes were small, but I found them to be just perfect. Between my friend and I, we ordered an antipasti, a salad, two pastas, one dessert, and two scoops of gelato, split between the two of us... and we had to take leftovers home. Suffice it to say, the portions were also perfect My two absolute favourite dishes out of the ones we tried were their antipasti Burrata, Baker Breeze  heirloom tomatoes, basil, chili oil, focaccia and their pasta Pappardelle, milk braised pork ragu, nduja, preserved cabbage, pecorino. 10/10 Recommend.",

We chose to go with the Alla Famiglia $79 per guest option to get a good tasting and variety off of the menu. We honestly werent sure if the amount of food we were getting would be worth the value. Ultimately, our server was amazing at selecting the perfect dishes based on our responses to his questions. We had prosciutto di parma and kanpachi crudo - both starters were so flavourful and fresh. The chicory salad was unique, more on the bitter side for me that lingered a little too much, but I appreciated that the roasted pears and hazelnuts tied everything together. I was a little worried about the cappelletti because of the gorgonzola cheese but the hints of preserved lemon shone through the  filling. The NY striploin - cooked a perfect medium rare, great flavour profile - outstanding! I also enjoyed every bite of candied carrots and other veggie sides. Overall my partner and I were very impressed with our meal due to quality of ingredients, generous portions for value , and ability to accommodate the menu to our preferred tastes. Quality was worth the value? Yes, for the alla famiglia style Would I come back? Yes Would I recommend to friends and family? Yes",

You get allot of food in each course and all of it was mouth watering. The service though...that was something that really stood out. Never have I had such amazing service. No empty plate sat on the table for more then 2 minute, the waiter was super attentive, without pressuring and the other wait staff were seen but not heard. It was also good to see what I can only assume to be the owner, making sure everything ran properly. This is a restaurant you must visit and will probably be rated the top Italian restaurant in 2021.",

            "review_text": "We came to Savio Volpe to celebrate our anniversary and we were not disappointed! We have never been to an Italian restaurant because hubby thinks making pasta at home is easy. This restaurant proved to us that good Italian food is worth going out for. We were greeted with glasses of Prosecco to celebrate our anniversary, which was such a pleasant surprise. We were also offered complimentary sparkling water for our table, which I loved! As for our meal, everything was delicious. Beef Carpaccio: 4/5 So delicious! I especially loved the leek aioli. My only complaint is that the plate wasn t bigger! Kale Salad: 3/5 Really tasty, but I think we could make this at home. Lamb Ragu: 5/5 This pasta dish knocked it out of the park for me. The type of pasta is not something I ve ever had before, and the texture was so cool! I loved the flavours of the meat and sauce too. So good. Pork chop: 5/5 The portion of this plate was outstanding! We were both in awe as this plate was delivered to us. There was a delicious honey sauce covering the meat and plate, and the meat was cooked perfectly. I also really enjoyed the sausage-stuffed morels.  We were pretty stuffed by the time this arrived so we took about half home as leftovers, and it s enough for a full meal for both of us. Cannoli: 5/5 This was the perfect way to end our meal. The pistachio, citrus, chocolate combination was to die for. We had never had cannolis before, but after this one, we are definitely fans! Overall, the food and service made this the perfect date night. We were very satisfied!",

            "review_text": "Very busy. Glad we reserved a table well ahead of time. We ordered Garlic knots, kids pasta with meatballs, kale salad, spaghetti Alla nerano, pork chop, German butter potatoes, chocolate tart and sorbetto. The special menu sounded fantastic but decided to go ahead with the regular menu items. Kids pasta had generous portion and the meatballs were very good. Garlic knots were devoured by my little boy. Kale salad also had a good portion and it was perfect to have with our pork chop. Spaghetti portion was bit on the small side (surprisingly) but the flavour and texture was fantastic. Porkchop was smoky, well seasoned and perfectly cooked. It was the one of the best porkchops I have tried so far. German butter potatoes were packed with flavour but ours had  a few that were a bit over-charred. Chocolate tart was decadent with pine nuts giving a perfect contrast. All in all, this was one of the most satisfying dinner Ive had recently. Definitely will go back. Kid-friendliness: Its a bit noisy and most menu items are not great for little kids. However, they do offer off the menu kids pasta. Staff are very kind and friendly to kids.",

            "review_text": "It was my first visit to this restaurant that Ive heard much about. We came here to celebrate a friends birthday and were very lucky to be able to get an earlier reservation. The octopus   carpaccio and the prosciutto were really good, paired well with the recommended wine. I was hesitant to try the bagna cauda because I dont like the fishy taste, but the bagna cauda was really flavorful. It was one of my favorite dishes of the night. Kale salade was fresh with just enough dressing.  The mains did not wow me much, but maybe we need to go back and try other dishes. The chicken was juicy and is well seasoned. We had gelato for dessert, the olive oil flavor was  interesting in a good way.  It was a wonderful dinner and we would come back again. Would recommend this place for couples night out, celebrations, or if you just need to treat yourself to a nice meal. Parking: Street parking",

My fiance has a severe allergy to peanuts and all tree nuts and they were able to accommodate fantastically. The server was really nice, and kept our glasses topped up. I came for my birthday and it came with a gelato at the end. Marinated Olives 1/5 Definitely my least favourite dish of the night. The olives definitely tasted better than any other olives that Ive had before but it was just too overwhelmingly salty for my palette Burrata (imported from Italy), coronation grape mostarda, frescolio oil with housemade crackers 5/5 Words cannot describe what I felt when I took that first bite of burrata, mostarda and cracker. It was perfect. The richness of the cheese paired so perfectly with the tartness of the mostarda and the crunchy crackers gave it the texture it needed. It was just ... Chefs kisses Kale Salad 5/5 Absolutely amazing. The bread crumb sprinkled on top of it was nice and crunchy even until the last bite. The tartness of lemon pepper dressing prepared us for the main course. Agnolotti Dal Plin 5/5 There were so many different flavours. You first taste the amazing sauce and then the agnolotti explodes with the amazing meat filling. Northern Golden NY Striploin 4/5 Cooked to a perfect medium rare. The beef was juicy and packed full of flavours. German Butter Potato 4/5 Flavour was amazing. It was just a bit too starchy for my liking. Broccolini Aglio e Olio 4/5 Nothing too special. It was just a good broccolini. A bit too greasy near the bottom, but I guess thats how aglio e olios are supposed to be. Tiramisu 5/5 Really good tiramisu. Not too sweet, and the lady fingers were nice and moist. Dietary restrictions: Accommodated for tree nuts and peanut allergy",

The food was delicious. They have a broad selection of various dishes, so, to simplify my life, I opted for their tasting menu, which I felt gave me a great cross-section of whats offered. The menu started with a high-quality antipasti, topped with a delicious cheese and aged balsamic. The salad they brought was so interesting, made primarily of apples, avonlea cheddar, and topped with a delicate citrus dressing. The highlight was definitely the pasta dish, made with burata and rabbit, was incredibly rich and delicious. This alone convinced me I would want to sample more of their pasta dishes next time I come back, although the 63 acres striploin that followed the pasta was also exceptionally well made. I did mark down their service, as the most recent time I went, there were wait times aplenty. I was seated 20 minutes past my reservation time, and the wait times for food were atrocious - very disappointing. I would still recommend this place based on the food alone, but their service is in need of some help if my most recent visit is any indication.",

            "review_text": "Wow. 10/10 experience. Food, service, ambiance, vibes, everything! In Preston we trust. Preston was a phenomenal server and gave us the most amazing experience and culinary adventure. The three of us dined alla famiglia at $75 each for appetizers, two pastas, an entree and dessert. We loved being able to try as many things as possible and Preston asked us what we liked and didn t like to curate the dishes and experiences. Every bite was amazing. For starters, we had the halibut croquettes. It was on special tonight and it was nice and crispy with a great aioli. Served next was the charcuterie board with an assortment of meats, grapes and plums. The star for me was the salad - wow. The dressing was stunning. Pastas were perfectly cooked. The spaghetti was so tasty and reminded us of an elevated carbonara of sorts. The other pasta whose name I forget but looked like/named after a rooster head was equally stunning. The entree - the feature specials - butterflied grilled fish, served with grilled zucchini and this eggplant stew. The fish was so soft but not over cooked and served over corn and beans. The eggplant stew was tasty but a tad oily. The star was the zucchini. Just grilled perfectly with a nice mint twist. A restaurant that makes vegetables taste good is truly a keeper. Dessert - we shared the feature gelato which was unreal - it tasted like a terry s orange. I would ve bought a whole gallon of it. The chocolate tart was also amazing - perfect dark chocolate, not too sweet with sea salt and pine nuts on top. I personally could have gone workout the olive oil. We also had a ton of great cocktails and wines recommended by Preston. Ended off the night with a digestivo - which is meant to be sipped and not taken like a shot! Preston recommended me a drink with an orange undertone to match the gelato, but my friends also really enjoyed the no. 82 amaretto and limoncello. Stunning meal, 10/10!",

            "review_text": "Wow this place did not disappoint! I came here without a reservation last Friday and they were able to get us in outside on the front patio. The 5 of us did the tasting menu/chefs choice. Each course had a few different dishes and the group got to share family style. The food was absolutely top notch and literally did not stop coming. I am pescatarian and they did a fantastic job accommodating for me while still offering some meat dishes to the rest of the group. The I cannot wait to go back and experience this culinary perfection. Cocktails were also delicious and pretty good wine list! Only con is being on the front patio, traffic is pretty loud on Kingsway, so I would suggest making a reservation for indoors.",
