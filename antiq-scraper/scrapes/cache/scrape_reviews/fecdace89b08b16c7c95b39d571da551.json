The oxtail stew, slow-cooked with a variety of vegetables, added a wonderful texture and taste. The oxtail itself was incredibly tender, practically melting in my mouth. The meal was rounded out with a refreshing cabbage salad and a warm, sweet cornbread. It was a truly satisfying and hearty meal that I would highly recommend to anyone curious about Nigerian cuisine.",

The candle smells divine. Will definitely be ordering in the future as well as recommending to everyone I know. Good Job Vansuya, keep up the good work.",

I ordered the Egusi Soup with  wrap  and Naija Smokey Jollof Rice. The Egusi soup was incredible - rich in spices, with cubes of beef. The beef was a little tough for my preference but with all the yummy flavour and texture going on, I still ate two servings. The  wrap  that came with it was more like a ball of sticky semolina-like grain to eat the soup with, and it soaks up all those curried spices nicely. The rice with the smokey chicken was also really good! Very cool. I look forward to trying more Nigerian food in the future :)",

This building is shared by 9 different take out only restaurants and you have to call them to bring out your order. There is free parking all along the street. I ordered the chicken shawarma through UberEats. The restaurant tried to reach me to tell me they ran out of chicken so some of it will be beef. I did receive a call but the caller ID automatically said suspected spam so I didnt answer. They were nice to write me a note with my order to let me know some things were changed. I did get to try both chicken and beef tough. The chicken was soft but the beef to me was a lot tougher. I prefer the chicken so I will try the chicken only again next time. I am a very big fan of sauce and if you like it too, this is a great place for you. The wrap is smothered in sauce and filled with meet and cabbage. If you cannot tolerate spice, the mild would still have a little spice as well. The large version was bigger than a shawarma wrap at other places. However, I found the original price very expensive as it was around $18 for a large wrap. The UberEats BOGO was a very good deal though.",
