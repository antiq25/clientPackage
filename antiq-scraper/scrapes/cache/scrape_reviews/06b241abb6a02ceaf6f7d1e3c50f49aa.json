He handled the situation well and I certainly appreciated his call and his willingness to hear my feedback. I ve changed my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars. Original Review: I ve been coming to Chewies for years, mostly on Sundays. I ve recently been back after COVID. Our  experience was less than optimal. The food was great all around, however the service was not great in the slightest. It took close to ten minutes for someone to come over. Once they did, we placed our order, but from there, we constantly had to ask for obvious things. More water, another drink, new fork, the bill, etc. Our entire time was spent trying to flag down the server to either order additional items or ask for common things. Not intuitive or on top of it at all. We also came at a time in which there were limited tables in the restaurant. The server probably had one or two tables to look out for. Disappointing. Chewies has always been a favourite destination, especially in Kits, because, you can head for a walk down the beach after your meal.",

First and foremost I would like to extend my appreciation for the support for Chewies over the past. My name is Jamie and I am the owner. Very rarely do I reply to the comments, but this one I felt it necessary. A post like this is obviously a double edged sword. I appreciate the fact that you have been a long time supporter, and the food was great, but the issue with the service is concerning. As I have always tried to stress to our service staff, service first, anything else second. It has been a very trying time since things have reopened. There is a definite lack of staff both FOH, and BOH which has made things even more complicated. By no means am I trying to make any excuses, and I would like to know exactly what time and when it happened (assuming it was on the Sunday, Aug 2nd). But just wanted to clarify. I/we take pride in our service and to have this happen is concerning. I would like to offer you a GC on us as a thank you for bringing this up, but more so an apology for your experience. Please let me know your thoughts. Thank you again for your support! Have a great day!",

We didnt get enough time to try out all the choices but we will go back. The Cajun Creole style mussels with sausage were delicious and my partners burger was apparently awesome, and he is quite the picky burger connoisseur. The price point was also in the affordable, not break the bank range. So combine all those things and its defineately worth 5 stars.",

Service was excellent, and the server had a great understanding of the menu, and how some of their dishes were different from the typical presentation. Good food, indifferent service. Aug 2016 3 stars Our server really didnt care about us. The place was busy, but he was more interested in socializing with one of the women sitting at the bar than remembering to bring our order. He didnt tell us about the happy hour price for oysters (it started 20 minutes after we arrived). He also sold us a bottle of wine that was available to $20 less at happy hour. The only good service we had was when we paid the bill. The server seemed quite happy that we were leaving. The food was good, but not worth putting up with the service. We noticed that the tables on either side of us also seemed to be getting poor service.",

My girlfriend and I came here after a sunny day at Kitsilano Beach/Pool, the staff was very friendly, accommodating and had us a table on the patio inside ten minutes. The food was the best part: Deep-fried Cauliflower (easily the best thing on the platter), Fried Brussel Sprouts with Gorgonzola Cheese, Cajun Fries and Cajun Fried Chicken. Beer selection was pretty good and the wine selection seemed even better. Even after my beers, her wine and the platter of food the bill was around $120.00 for the both of us - well deserved in my opinion.",

Their Breakfast is to die for and I highly recommend you come try it on the weekends before your stroll down the street to Kits beach. They also have an amazing selection of oysters and very knowledgeable shuckers. I have had some of the best oysters of my life at Chewies. Location, food, drinks, ambiance, and staff are all 10/10. When ever I have someone visiting town this is a place I always take them to. The room and staff really make you feel at home and thats a big reason why I always come back. My wife and I are there at least once a week and this is a Kitsilano/Vancouver staple. Family owned and operated I will definitely continue to be a loyal patron. Thanks crew de chew you never disappoint!",

Answered all our questions about the different types of oysters we received, highlighting the best attributes of each. The oysters were fresh and succulent. The fries were well seasoned but not too salty. The portable burger could ve had a bit more structured it definitely slips out one end, my recommendation is to make a bed of the fries for the burger to spill over onto. Fantastic service start to finish, experiences like this are why I go out for meals and why I will be definitely coming back to Chewies Kits for date night and beyond. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.",
