We attended last Saturday before a Canucks game and this Saturday before the Bryan Adams concert. Despite it being exceptionally busy, the front counter hostesses were smiling, calm and super inviting. The serving staff were very personable and we had multiple people check on us during our meal, including the Manger Albert (who is a Rockstar) and the restaurant Supervisor. The food was also great and served very fast! If youre looking for a place to go before or after an event nearby I would definitely recommend BC Kitchen. However, if its before and event I would also recommend reservations as its a popular spot. Thank-you again for the exceptional service during our last couple visits! We look forward to coming by again soon!",

Also, with tickets, get a discount on your order on GameDay. That was a nice bonus. Typical bar good with a few unique dishes but the burger might be the sneaky best downtown Ive had. Great flavour.

Honestly, I really like the food and it will not take much to improve the service. So, I will retract my original stance and give this place another chance. Below is my original review: Reso made for pre-hockey game. Seated at 5pm sharp and the experience degraded from there. Finally able to place a drink order by 5:33 because I flagged someone down. It didnt get better as we were ignored the whole time we were there. Even management didnt care - the guy couldnt even look me in the eye. I would rather eat at the arena than come here again. Food was good and vibe is good but the lack of service just makes that all disappear.",

Although it was weird to walk through the casino to get to the restaurant, I really enjoyed that it wasnt too loud/overwhelming given the number of TVs on and showing sports. The Market East side of the menu had DELICIOUS Asian food, and it was great the get the variety along with the pub fare. I found all the food came out piping hot, and service was attentive but not overbearing. Will definitely be back.",

            "review_text": "There was a concert next door, so the restaurant was very busy, and seemed understaffed to handle the amount of patrons in for dinner or drinks. We placed our appetizer order, followed by the entree order a few minutes afterwards.  We then didnt see our server until after we were more than halfway done our entrees.  While the food was brought out quickly by the runners, no refills on drinks were offered at our table, while all other tables around us where receiving water refills constantly. We went because of the prime rib special being offered for Labour Day weekend, and although I ordered it medium rare, it came out medium well.  Also, minor complaint...on the menu it says the prime rib comes with au jus, but it seems like it was a red wine au jus, and tasted rather sweet.  With no salt/pepper set on the table, and no check-up from our server, I ended up eating the now sweet tasting over-cooked prime rib. We had great experiences at the restaurant previously, but this was enough to turn us away.  I dont think we will be returning.",

The waitress brought 2 sets of fork and knife and 3 napkins while we were a table of FIVE. It was so hard to get their attention to bring extra cutleries so I didn t bother and just ate my calamari by hands. Others in my table had to wait for awhile to get more forks since they ordered prime rib. We also used our own napkins, luckily we carried some with us. The waitress also didn t want to hournor their prime rib special deal until we showed her deal on the Parq website. She walked away for a bit, came back with another person to confirm that the prime rib special doesn t come with a drink, then walked away again, came back and said she will make it works for us then brought a glass of wine to the person who showed her the website earlier. The other two in my table had to ask for their beers. Prime rib special isn t something new at BC kitchen and we had it many times before. The staff should know better.",

            "review_text": "I was attending a concert and thought I would try BC Kitchen. Big disappointment. I had the Prime Rib (house smoked Prime Rib served with crispy potatoe, mixed vegetables, au jus & yorkshire pudding) and a happy hour glass of wine.  The best part of the whole meal was the wine and au jus. The prime rib was adequate, the crispy potato was not crispy, the mixed vegetables consisted of 3 pieces of extremely hard broccoli and the Yorkshire pudding was disgusting. I ordered a second glass of wine so that I could swallow the food which took 15 minutes to arrive. By that time I had finished my disgusting dinner. Needless to say, I will not be returning anytime soon. Save your money and eat at McDonalds. After posting my review, the manager Albert) stopped by and we discussed my concerns with my meal and in the end made it right. He is going to talk to the kitchen and gave me a nice glass of wine. Thank you Albert for taking the time to address my concerns.",
