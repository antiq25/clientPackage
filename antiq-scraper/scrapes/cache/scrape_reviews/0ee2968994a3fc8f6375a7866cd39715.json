Golds BC offered me a good deal in May for multi-access across all Golds Gyms in BC, which would activate once the gyms were allowed to reopen. I first used the West Broadway facility before the UBC location reopened. The UBC location is great. It has everything I need. The staff are friendly. Not hard to register a spot (right now you need to make a reservation to workout), since the location isnt crowded. I think the company is doing pretty good considering the circumstances.",

He makes it easy to understand the reasons for each exercise and the metrics for keeping track of progress. He also has very clear explanations for correcting postures and avoiding injuries which are especially important for weight training. I am very happy with the quality of PT provided by Bryan and Golds Gym. As for the gym, it is very clean and offers a wide variety of equipment.

Both the staffs and clients are so friendly, making the entire environment comfortable. Talking about PT, I have been trained under Ariana s instructions for the past two months, and I absolutely love how professional and inspiring she is! I wasn t new to gym and I was trained under two different PTs before. Comparing my past and recent experiences, I think Ariana is the type of PT that truly spends time planning out systematic schedules to fulfill clients  needs rather than throwing random stuffs from days to days. Since day 1 of the training, she has already awaken my muscles and strength for compound exercises which were scheduled weeks later. She is able to provide easy-to-follow instructions and detail suggestions for further improvement. She definitely pushes me to challenge myself more. I couldn t be able to imagine how much I have accomplished within such a short period of time. I used to go to gym just for the sake of  health  and I struggled mentally every single time. However, I really enjoyed my times working out in the gym this two months, and even looking forwards to attending specific  interesting  sessions haha. Overall, if you are looking for a PT who is both professional and fun to talk with, I would highly recommend Ariana to you!",

I become more energetic everyday. She is so sweet and easygoing, and most of all, she is very caring of my experience. I would recommend her to anyone who is new to gyms or who is professional. Also, on the days I don t train with her, she would always instruct me via message. She would give honest opinions, motivates you, and gives recommendations on healthy diets. When the first time I went to Michelle, all I wanted what to lose weight. Right now, I want to build muscle and strength and look fit and healthy. She really changed my idea of a  perfect body . Overall, working out is fun and my body is becoming more fit and proportionate.

If you also consider to have a personal trainer, Ian Standish I suggest. He is one of their best trainers, I started working out with him since March 2019, and we made a lot of progress in the last 3 months. He is experienced and well organized. He keeps tracking on my strength and cares about how I feel through out the workout. He makes small changes to our workout every session  and encourages me to push harder. I have had a great experience here with these people,  and Im very excited to have my next body composition test on June 1st, and see how much progress I have made.",

UPDATED** Current letting 40 members in the gym at a time and no more booking system. Tap in with your fob and workout when you want! Live tracker is available on the website for each location. YOU CAN STAY up to 1 hours and 45 min during non peak times, 1 hours and 15 min during peak times. UMPs peak times run Monday-Thursday 12-730 pm and Friday Saturday after 12 until about 7. Sundays are mostly dead. Front desk staff track your workout time when you check in and will give you a heads up if they have a line waiting and you need to exit... You can always tap out, jump back in line and workout again tho. Cleaning is on point, compared to other facilities the team uses a cleaning log to ensure every 15 MINUTES different areas of the gym are sanitized. Its still mandatory to wear your mask inside, so come prepped with an active wear mask rather than a heavy cotton one. (you can buy viral off Golds Gym branded masks at the front desk) They also now sell a variety of Golds Gear, visit the website for more info and pics :)",

Today I stopped by for a personal training session with Bryan Wong (more on that later!), and was blown away by the gym. Super clean, tons of machines and weights, friendly staff... Overall, a super professional and fun environment! If youre looking for a gym with a little more space, a few more options, and a super motivating atmosphere - Golds is the place for you! The location is also super fantastic: super accessible (with amazing open hours) and conveniently located. I did an assessment with Bryan followed by a two-hour training session, and let me tell you... I am beyond DEAD! Bryan pushed me super hard, motivated me a ton, and gave me a plethora of unique pointers to utilize in my future lifts. I am super excited to incorporate what I learned with him into my routine and ultimately get stronger! Definitely work with him if you get the opportunity - you wont regret it and your muscles will be thanking you later (even if it hurts in the interim). Overall, I had such a positive experience at Golds Gym at UBC and would recommend it to anyone! Even if youre a bit skeptical, check it out! A drop-in session never hurt anyone - unless, you know, you like, actually injure yourself... (But with the super great staff present, thats not gonna happen! And also, know your limits and be safe.)",

At least where I gym, the management is different and the reception is nice as well. The membership plans are far simpler than what it used to be. If you do not want to become a member then you do not have to. However, the gym has been a pleasant experience for me. Some of the equipment is really fab!!!",

Especially Kyle is a manager who is very professional yet easy to communicate with. There are equipment for powerlifting, bodybuilding and weightlifting. 4 racks, 3 deadlift platforms and 2 benches, 2 incline benches so there are plenty of spots to train compound movements such as deadlift, bench press and squat. During the covid times, the employees here are doing the best job maintaining the gym clean and safe place and they are following the protocol rigidly. Trainers here are super knowledgeable and professional as well!",

Bryan has really helped me work on my bench, squats and deadlifts. To me, Bryan is not just my trainer or coach, he s also my good friend and a big brother. It s good to have someone you look up to and Bryan is that person for me. Often between sets, or outside of gym, he gives me a lot of his wisdom and tips on fat loss, muscle building, nutrition or life in general. He always keeps me accountable on my goals and has instilled in me a lot of discipline. Highly recommend Bryan if you re looking for a personal trainer.",

My goal was to become stronger, tone my muscles and have a proportionate body that I would be proudly showing off anywhere and I achieved that! Within a few months, I can dead lift 140 pounds and I have a wonderful feeling of firmness. I am a confident person but my self-confidence grew exponentially since I have been exercising with Ian.
