            "review_text": "Vij s gave my family and I a beautiful dining experience. We sat in the rooftop patio, which is full of charming little details, like the bracelets strung onto the tree branches, the rice bag pillowcases, and the bar where you can see your drinks being made. The staff team worked very efficiently to attend to every table. I didn t ever feel that we were left waiting for too long to place an order and our water glasses never ran empty. Everyone was really nice, and our main waiter was very knowledgeable about the whole menu and offered suggestions when we needed them. Vij himself was making the rounds and checked in with us a few times. I tend to ramble describing food in reviews, but nothing I say will really do justice to this. The food is served family-style, meant to be shared. The total before tip for the three of us was about $180. I think this was a competitive price for the experience we had. There were complimentary snacks delivered to our table shortly after we were seated: papri and pakoras. Our waiter mentioned that we could have the kitchen  order for us , which sounded like fun, but I had a few specific dishes I wanted to make sure to try, so we chose our own menu. For appetizers, we ordered the rockfish cakes on coconut curry and chickpeas in star anise date masala, and for mains, cauliflower black chickpea cakes in tomato fenugreek curry and lingcod in green onion coconut curry. The appetizers and mains both came with naan and the mains came with jeera rice. For dessert, we had the mango kulfi and coconut kneer. We all each had a cocktail too (the Vieux Delhi for me, and others had a G&T and a Cambie Sour). I can t pick a favourite dish (or drink) - even though there were dishes I was more drawn to based on my personal favourite flavours, everything was executed perfectly in its own way. The concept is unique from other upscale Indian restaurants - the food is essentially Indian but the experimentation with the flavours reflects the influence of Vancouver s culinary culture. The spice level varies with each dish but is generally pretty moderate; on average, things were between a  mild  and a  medium  level at most Indian restaurants in North America, so I can t see the spice level being too high for anyone unless you have a severe intolerance. For those who like spicier food, the lack of kick is compensated for by the richness of the other spices. I would highly encourage fans of Indian cuisine and/or fine dining to just go and give them a try if you re interested in a new experience for Indian food. I m always inclined to try as many places as possible which means I don t often make return visits to places that are out of my way, but this is a place I would definitely visit again to try more of the menu.",

The garam masala portobello mushroom in porcini cream curry was dreamily delicious - rich, cheesy, full of umami from the mushroom - and dipping the naan into the curry   you just couldn t stop having another bite. We also enjoyed the masala dhaba dish which showcased a creative variety of flavors. The lamb popsicles were probably their most famous dish - no regret ordering. Also met Chef Vij himself who kindly walked around and greeted the guests. Hope would come back some day and try other things :)",

I wanted to treat mom to our favorite dish so we picked up takeout from Vijs. Since the old days, Vijs now offer the Lamb Popsicles as a small dish as oppose to an entree. We were confused and actually phoned them to clarify. The employee who answered our call advised that since the dish is so popular, people wanted to try other dishes yet have a small portion of the classic which they now offer. Mom was happy when we surprised her with the Lamb Popsicles. There was ample rice and naan included with the meal. The Lamb Popsicles in Fenugreek Cream Curry was as delicious as we remembered. The samosas were fresh and flavorful. Most importantly, mom was happy and full. Get this dish when youre here!",

Not sure if they have their own lot, but theres plenty of parking in the area, [Accessibility] theres a ramp to the front entrance, and theres a lower level with washrooms that is wheelchair friendly. Some steps to a second level. [Atmosphere] it was busy at 8pm on a Saturday. They play good Indian music at a comfortable level for conversation. The decor is classic, and the mood is set nicely with tea lights. [Service] Top notch service! I really appreciated how mindful and accommodating they were of our food allergy. Everyone working there was very kind and helpful, especially Becca, who served us. [Food] the pork spoon with apple-mint chutney and the lamb Popsicles were super delicious. Everything we ate played with every part of the taste buds. I highly recommend Vijs!",

Good service is a really big deal for me and I felt really well served there. They knew how to make recommendations on the menu and they all felt like they were in a good mood (this adds so much to my eating-out-experiences that I cant leave it out of the review). Also really enjoyed the fact that their washroom has a cloth towel system which helps our planet so much. The food was incredible! I loved everything I tested and I tasted a couple things.

Everyone was super professional and although the restaurant was nearly full, I felt like we were the only ones there based on how well our servers treated us. They also offered us a cup of hot chai as we sat down which was much needed coming in from the -10degC snowy weather outside! The portions here are fantastic and I cannot stress enough how good the food is. I dont even know which of the three dishes that we ordered was my favourite because they were all so good. Also the cocktail list was a great surprise! An extensive list of specialty cocktails that all sounded delicious and the few that we had were delicious. I wish we could have had one of everything on the menu. I cant wait to come back!!",

Definitely, Vij s is a different Indian restaurant. From the very beginning you ll see the difference everywhere from the staff to the food. It has won various awards by famous food critiques and newspapers with the top one by Mark Bittman, New York Times. The menu is completely different from typical Indian restaurants which makes it more attractive. You have 7 main options & 11 appetizers to choose from that make your job a lot easier. The staff is really nice & king and you feel the happiness among them. Recommendations: Appetizers: Cauliflower, Portobello Mushrooms Mains: Lingcod, Lamb Popsicles, Coconut Curried Chicken, Lamb in Cumin *** You ll definitely experience the difference & fall in love with Dij s.

Every single dish including appetizers, mains and the dessert was very carefully prepared with perfectly balanced flavours! The service was also great and the chef himself kept checking up on us which was impressive.

            "review_text": "What a beautiful patio at Vijs!   Even on a misty evening, it was warm enough to remove my coat as the patio is heated.  I do not like eating with my coat on.  The protocols in place are implemented and I felt 100% comfortable dining out. I grew up and still live near Main & 49th and though some Indian restaurants are no longer there, I would say by far, the food at Vijs is really the best. The real treat of the evening Chef Vikram Vij was there going from table to table thanking us for supporting local.  We were the first table Chef came by and I noticed him immediately.   I helped my husband take a picture with Chef! We both ordered Thali which you choose 4 items (from appetizers and mains).  So much to choose from!  I chose: rainbow trout, tamarind and yogurt marinated and grilled chicken w/ salad, BC pork tenderloin and one more I cant remember (sorry!).  Thali comes with rice and naan bread. The spices and flavour, oh my goodness, I cant describe it as its so out of this world!  Though I dont like spicy food, some of the sauce as a bit too spicy however, I was able to power through. For dessert, we shared almond rice pudding and it was a nice end to our dinner at Vijs.  We had an amazing time at Vijs. Support local as much as you can!",

Sometimes Vij himself will go from table to table to say hi and check up on everyone, and perhaps throw in a dad joke or two!  Very nice and charming guy!  In fact, all the staff we ve encountered during all of our visits were lovely and welcoming.  The food is delicious of course!  The quality and flavours are consistently good, and portion size is generous we always leave full and satisfied.  Favourites are the Eggplant & Onion Rings appetizer, the classic Lamb Popsicles, and the Mango Kulfi dessert.  (We miss the crushed pistachio they used to put on the frozen mango dessert.)

            "review_text": "At the insistence of friends, we visited Vij s restaurant yesterday. Our friends indicated it was the best Indian food they ve ever had. In fact, if you Google this (which, obviously you have), you will notice that it is rated as or among the best Indian restaurants in Vancouver. The food is excellent, but is spiced to a North American palette. I call that smart business, but for me, it was a tiny bit disappointing being used to spicy foods. Absolutely come for the food but what makes this restaurant really special is the extraordinary level of service. We were greeted upon our arrival like old friends. The host make sure we were comfortable in a shady spot up on the top floor patio as it was a hot day. Cold water was brought immediately and we were served by several people; the bartender, the server, a member of the kitchen staff (who brought complementary appetizers), a food runner, and yet another server. ALL of these individuals made us feel like we were the most important customers they ve ever had. I was having trouble figuring out which one of them was the owner. But that mystery was soon solved, because it wasn t long before the owner, Mr. Vikram Vij, looking every bit the part of a proud Indian chef, came along to make sure that we were comfortable. After the amazing food arrived, Vikram came back and asked the following question:  how do you like my food?  He didn t say  how s the food  He said, how do you like MY food?  Now that s the kind of personal commitment and ownership that is missing at most of today s dining establishments. There s no person behind the food - that is certainly is not the case here. My only regret is that we live at the other side of the country, meaning that my next visit to Vij s will sadly be sometime in the future rather than my preferred next weekend. Vegetarian options: We enjoyed an amazing vegetarian tray (as well as a spicy chicken curry) which came uniquely served on a platter with complementary naan bread. Every dish was amazing.",

            "review_text": "First off, if you want cheap Indian food, this is not the place for you. This is Indian fusion meets fine dining and the price will of course reflect that. We made a reservation (reservations are a relatively new thing, so do make one if you dont want to wait for a while in the lounge) and were seated promptly after about a five min wait outside of the restaurant (it had just opened and it was the middle of dineout Vancouver). As soon as we sat down, we received some complementary pakoras, chaat, and were asked if we wanted tea, which was a great touch. Service throughout the evening was incredibly attentive, prompt, and professional. Even more impressive given with how busy the restaurant became with dineout Vancouver going on. It was our first time at the restaurant and the service was great with recommending what we should try. We were hoping to meet Vikram Vij but it must have been a night he was off. Everything about the restaurant is well thought out and on point. The ambiance is very nice, with candles on each table. Water was served in authentic copper jugs, and tea in metal cups, which my South Asian roots appreciated! If youre South Asian like me, youll appreciate how authentic and flavourful the tea and food will be. We ordered the garam masala mushrooms (amazing!), coconut curried veggies (okay but not bad), and the rainbow trout (also delicious). It was just two of us and we ordered small plates to share, and we were full by the end of the night. We cant wait to make our next trip to enjoy Vijs!",

With the amazing talent of the chef, it was rated as the best Asian restaurant by the Vancouver magazine. Today, Vijis move to a brand-new and far larger location, with state-of-the-art interior and modern design. We didn t have a reservation (Do make a reservation people this place is crowded!) and we have to wait for around 15 minutes. Unlike most restaurants, this place features a waiting area with tons of sofa and chair, and you could even order some drinks from the bar while waiting. The waitress was really kind and explained the entire menu to us (which is handwritten by the way). Dont be intimidated by the hefty price tags of the dishes, this place offers half-portion for $18 which is perfect for sharing and trying a larger variety of their menu. We ordered the signature lamb popsicles and I got to say it is the best lamb I ve ever tried in my entire life. (I am not even exaggerating) The lamb is tender and flavourful. We spent a total of $122.33 for 3 people.",

Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and very flavourful. I do wish that the dishes were more saucy though. We were given so much rice and naan but not enough sauce to dip them in!

Vij s Rangoli is a fabulous restaurant with a casual but professional vibe. My husband is gluten intolerant so we were very happy to find so many gluten free options. We started with the pakoras with a zesty date and tamarind chutney (a delicious and generous portion) and the Kofta - Pork, Zucchini, Carrot with a spicy sour cream sauce. Their house white is flavourful and pleasant and perfectly complemented our appetizers. We shared the Coconut curry lamb and the Chicken Bengali which came in a delicious  Creamy cumin sauce. Rather than naan bread, gluten free Corn chapatis were provided. We chose a BC Merlot which was recommended and was a perfect choice with the mains. Not being dessert people, we ordered a second Kofta to complete our feast - so yummy!! Many thanks to our servers - Parker & Paul for their personable and professional attention. Highly recommended!",

We started with potato and red pepper samosas and the portobello mushrooms in porcini cream curry. Wow! Both good, but the mushrooms were incredible. For the entrees we had the beef in kalonji cream curry, like the most tender pot roast, but in a deeply spiced sauce. Perfect with the naan and basmati rice served on the side. We also had the cauliflower and black chickpea cakes in a creamy tomato fenugreek sauce. Like amazing veggie meatballs! The wonderful chef and owner Vikram Vij came by the table twice to chat and make sure the food was perfect. The whole staff was great! Highly recommend!",

For starters we had Kale+jackfruit , peas+lentils and potato+pepper veg samosas which were absolutely delicious. Entre included a selection of  jackfruit/kale/cauliflower/potato curry combo and blackpeas/onion coconut curry both of which did not disappoint ( although we had our reservations about the selection ;) ) they also have masala chai(refill) which was a life saver on the snow day! Thanks @vijsrangoli for showcasing that Indian food is much more than paneer dishes and chana masala with Naan. Amazing and friendly staff too.She offered to give me a to go chai cup for re fill since it was raining. Totally worth the 25 mins bus ride to restaurant . Will definitely recommend if you are in Vancouver.",

Never once did I have to ask for a refill, top marks. I highly recommend the Garam masala sauteed portobello mushrooms in porcini cream curry. It was out of this world good!! Our group really enjoyed the lamb popsicle curry as well. Street parking is available out front which is a plus.",

It was a sudden plan without any prior booking, so we just called to book a table to avoid waiting outside but unfortunately due to a busy Saturday we couldn t find a table inside and had to sit outside on Patio. We were amazed to see Vikram (Owner) himself took quiet a number of rounds to our table asking about our wellness and comfort, my younger one was feeling cold outside, so he pulled out a blanket from his car and gave it to her. It was an amazing gesture from a wonderful Gentleman! Later on when the food started coming on, without bothering to save a prayer, we all ravenously jumped on it like a pack of starving wolves. We were amazed at the quality, the food was absolutely delicious, tasted like a freshly cooked home food without any preservatives. The best part was you didn t feel bloated after eating at an Indian Restaurant. Later on we got to know by Vikram that they don t have a recipe and they cook it fresh for every time. Our 5  rating for the entire team of Vij s and a special Thanks to Vikram for the ultimate Hospitality!!",

(he came to know about Vij s through a friend) he described his experience in such an amazing way that it left a mark on me  and I made up my mind that whenever I visit Vancouver I ll go there. Fast forward year 2022 , 6 year later I finally had a chance to visit Vancouver and on day three of my trip me and my friends had made reservation to visit them I made sure a month prior to make a reservation and I was excited for this gastronomic experience even reached there 15 minutes prior to our reservation the hustle bustle the ambience and aromatic smell oh boy I was ready but guess what I pulled up a classic move   showed up a day before our reservation !   ( we were supposed to leave for jasper the next morning and than GTA bound from there ) The restaurant was busy at it was Friday night ! The kind hostess smiled and told me oh honey the reservation is for tomorrow happens to best of us and there dropped my excitement , but I guess she saw how sad I was and asked us to wait ! And got us really good table in like 5 mins THIS..THIS is what s  going to stay with me forever the experience the service along with beautifully prepared delicious food and now I hear anyone going to Vancouver I make sure to tell them that do visit Vij s ! Thank you for the amazing time and food ! Food so good that forgot to take picture",

Always consistent, VJ is an amazing host, the meats and veggies used are top notch and I have never been disappointed. Vegetarian options: Plenty of Vegetarian options as with most any Indian restaurant. The dietary types are noted on the menu. Dietary restrictions: I am gluten free and if you mention your dietary needs the staff are very attentive and understanding. VJs is a great place and all will feel welcome not matter the dietary needs. Wheelchair accessibility: There is a long ramp to the entrance with atleast half dozen tables available on the lower level for easy access.",
