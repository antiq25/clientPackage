No fuss delicious hot & freshly prepared food. This is the first time in 15 years I have been served piping hot food to eat. Ideally,, by the time I get to my table, or the food gets brought to me in the car from Drive through, it is cold, the coffee tastes like Luke warm water & the pop is out of Gas. No wonder I hated McDonalds fast food. Believe me I truely enjoyed my meal today. Infact because I really enjoyed my meal today, we sat & also enjoyed Apple pies as an extra treat. I definately recommend all to try out this location, you will never again return to all those problem locations again. Very neat & cleans, no over flowing garbage bins or even a single dirty table, where customers had to clean, before eating their meals. Every single point at this location, was past excellent. Thank you McDonalds Restaurants.",
