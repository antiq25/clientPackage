            "review_text": "I have recently rejoined Golds Gym Port Coquitlam after over 4 years of not much exercise. I was concerned how I would be viewed as I have gained a lot of weight since the break from gym due to my accident.  I was putting off joining gym again as I was embarrassed about how I now looked. I set up an appointment with Ruba to find out about joining again.  Ruba was super friendly, knowledgeable, and so kind.  I was put at ease as there was no judgement.  While there I saw a lot of other members of staff who remembered and greeted me.  They were super kind.  Ruba then made an appointment for my free personal training session with Paolo. As soon as I met Paolo I knew that he would be very helpful in my path to getting back to the way I was before the accident.  He is very patient, kind and explains what each exercise benefits are in a fun way.  He also adjusted each exercise according to my mobility limitations. I feel positive I will get to my goal of how I was before the accident. I am truly grateful to Golds for putting me back on track.  Even though it might take a while.  I am motivated by Paolo and I am trying hard to get there again. I really appreciate all the kindness and positive encouragement I have been given.  I will work till I achieve my goal of getting back to how I was before.  Happy, Healthy, and Strong. Thank you so much for your help with my journey.

Gold gym have been very flexible with holding your membership during Covid time so I give them credit for that for sure . They also have many promotions and my favourite is offering same price of my membership to my friends ( you can t beat that). My membership is 23 bucks per month. You can t get better deal than that - 24 hours gym workout and including these classes . Great atmosphere when you get in there and love to see all ages taking care of themselves",

Everytime you walk into the gym, the workers greet you very well despite how early or late it is. I ve managed to build bonds with some of them as well. Ruba the general manager for example. I only first saw her about 3-4 months ago but when I started making small talk with her, she gave me super chill vibes and is approachable.  Very kind and makes golds a welcoming place. Now I make sure to say hello to her whenever I can. There s also cole who I can laugh and talk with at the gym. There s also Christina who always asks me how I am when I walk in. She will also remember who you are because she prioritizes customer service. Basically the environment is very friendly because of the staff and members. Anyone who is new to lifting shouldn t be afraid to come work out here. The equipment is also great. Whenever machines need to be fixed, it will be taken care of within 3-5 days. And a very clean and safe place. paolo is good too",

I have had nothing but a positive experience at this gym the staff and owners are extremely friendly and personable. Up until recent with the surge of COVID there has been some stigma around safety at gyms and I would have to say this Poco golds gym is very cautious and careful around safety protocol and making sure to implement all safety measures to make not only the members feel safe but the staff as well. I really love coming to golds gym and will continue to be a long term member for the foreseeable future.",

Program is perfectly fit for my body weight , height and age. She also teaches me how to prevent injuries during the weight training. She teaches  me how to stretch each body part. Program is really outstanding - lots of details to right postures, right weight selections, chair height, bar positions and so much more. Highly recommend.",

You are always made to feel like you belong there. The facility communicates verbally, through signage, and with online emails, and webpages. COVID precautions were followed diligently. After a year of membership, interrupted by COVID, I decided to retain the assistance of a personal trainer with some mobility and fitness issues. Erica Lee was chosen based on my spouse s experience helping her with her fitness and mobility issues. We are 69 and 70 years old otherwise very fit for our age. Erica, through a painful supervised and assisted exercise routine has dramatically improved my mobility to do my ordinary activities of daily living. Having lots of strength and cardio exercise capacity does not work well if movement is painful or restricted. She has improved the quality of my life in ways I could not do for myself. Erica supervises  and assists my workout twice a week. My plan is continue this program with Erica indefinitely.. thank you Golds Gym",
