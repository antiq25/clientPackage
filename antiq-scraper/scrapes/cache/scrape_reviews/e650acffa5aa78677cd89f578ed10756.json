Everybody was kind nervous and must wear the masks all the time . But everyone was working out hard and kind of feeling strong and positive . Really appreciate this gym kept opening during covid .  Thank God that the COVID is ended . Personally I really love this gym as it s big and modern plus The facilities are great . Staffs are very friendly... especially the coaches..I also introduced a male friend of mine to the gym and he bought one year personal training with the coach Louis . And I introduced another female friend to joined the gym to I have One suggestion   that hope the owner can read it . ( I suggested managers several times but not working . ) . If this gym has the rule ( No Heavy weights smashing ) that May help this gym environment in a safer . harmony . and may help the business grow. My suggestion is Please put a Sign ( don t drop weights heavily) next to the all weights areas that I saw in other gyms has it which is really help . Please let the stafffs especially the sales team Educate all new members + old members should drop the weights carefully not drop the weights very heavily that can make a huge noise and the floor is shaking . This second floor is standing so much  massive weighs include the hundreds heavy metal machines and heavy weights . Plus the busy crowd . How much weights total are in this gym ? I m worrying about mostly because it s on Second floor not on the ground . I will never worry about this issue if it s on the ground floor . I really don t like the some clients smash the weights so loudly which is hurting others ears   and feelings as well .. please support me if anyone saw my suggestion here that you are thinking sane as me . Peace   and love",

I love this gym cause its near at 10 minutes from home and 10 from my work, I start to work at 6 am on the morning everyday with no specific end timing usually 7pm. The last three weeks I was on the gym at 4:00am (my only time possible) with a couple people around. Perfect for the circuits and bi series of workout talking about the machines and everything. Thats impossible in the weekdays on rush hours. Everyone knows that the workouts its different for each person so I think some people have different needs including to reach their goals muscle gain, losing weight etc. Thats why the 24 hours could works too and with less people around its safer than the rush hours.  Im thinking to going today and cancel my membership and going to another one with the 24/7 hours service. Anyway Im a simple person who lose 40 kgs 12 years ago trying to keep and maintain his weight. My two cents.",

The business is opened 24/7, has brand new fitness equipment, good variety and number of machines (no line-ups) and very decent change rooms. My wife also signed up and she could find a good variety of classes, all included in the premium plan. One cool thing about the classes is that, if youre unable to attend to one of the scheduled times, you can play video instructions on the rooms wall projector at any time. This is a very spatious place and, in addition to the common area, there is also an area for personal training, and a workout area for women only (although many of them prefer to use the common area because it has a better variety of machines). After my first week, I dont have one single reason to complain about it.",

The old staff is gone which is understandable as people tend to move on, the place is now starting to show lack of maintenance on the equipment, the washrooms are not being cleaned and they still have no wifi.  My husband and I have decided to cancel our membership as were paying $120.00 per month for what? When we went to the front counter to speak about cancelling, the woman said ok and she proceeded to cancel. No questions like, may I ask if there is anything I can do to change your mind or assist you with, just a simple ok. Our membership expires in November which we are going to check out places like Steve Nash, Anytime Fitness and other places. The only staff member there is the person who signed us up is Jared. Maybe we should reach out to him but we feel now the damage is done. Goodlife fitness, retaining your clients, keeping the place clean, up with the maintenance and give the dam wifi like you have used as your sales pitch may keep your members and bring in even more.
