They were on time organized and did not leave any mess behind for me to clean up. They take there time and put some thought behind the work they are doing. The wire maybe covered by drywall after but they take there time to tie them up and organize them. They don t leave a maze of wire they hide them making it hard for a nail to accidentally hit anything. Would recommend them to anyone looking for quality work. Great crew with amazing knowledge.

Repel was extremely patient with them and walked them through the different options and price points, creating multiple quotes along the way. The repel team communicated very well with our contractors even though they were extremely hard to deal with. We worked mostly with Alvin and Erik who were very friendly and knowledgable. They ended up also suggesting and installing a beautiful smart TV and sound bar in the living room and also installing our door bell system. The best part is they were able to connect all our devices to a single remote making everything extremely easy to use. My parents love their TVs and were extremely satisfied with Repels services!

            "review_text": "BEST PRICE IN TOWN with the same HIGH QUALITY products and service as other popular brands. Alvin, the owner, was very professional, knowledgeable, responsive, personable, and accommodating. He came on-site several times - something few companies do. They work VERY hard for you. One time, the painter ruined the HDMI cable, so Repel brought a new one - except it was defective, so they stayed a couple hours until Alvins brother brought a replacement and retested everything before they left. It was so easy to just leave a new cable without doing anything, but these guys do everything with diligence. We got their home monitoring install + service, security camera package, low voltage (TV/telephone/internet) install, home theatre package, central vacuum, water bug, you name it. Repel offers competitor top tier monitoring service package for a price cheaper than the competitors basic price! Weve used their products for 3 months now, and the only issue I had was with the security cameras. The manufacturer is from China and partially state-owned so Im a bit paranoid about installing their app on my phone. And weve had a couple of connectivity issues on the monitor. HOWEVER, it does the job so I cant complain. If you are deciding between Repel and another company, always, always, always choose Repel. Save yourself some trouble, time, and money.",
