            "review_text": "Had an amazing meal at Krsma Indian Cuisine today ! We got the Tandoori Chicken (15.95) it was four pieces of amazingly juicy, piping hot chicken. It was well marinated and very fragrant ! We also got the Krsma Chicken Tikka (15.95) which was super juicy , tender and had a slight sourness from the yogurt. Lastly we got an order of fish pakoras (9.95). These were lightly battered and very juicy. The batter was crispy and lightly salted. Amazing with the mint chutney! The staff were generous and gave us complimentary papadum! It was very crispy and lightly salted. It came with tamarind and mint chutney. The mint chutney was stellar ! It was the perfect blend of sour, spicy any lemon! Edit (10/21/23): went back for lunch and tried their Onion Bajia 8.95 and fish korma 15.95 with a side of rice (4.95). The onion Bajia was very crispy and lightly battered, with the perfect amount of saltiness and crispiness. The fish korma was outstanding! The cashew curry was very rich and had a yummy sweetness to it. The fish was also very tender. The owner was kind and provided a Gulab Jamun on the house, it was nice and warm...mmmm. Vegetarian options: They have many vegetarian and vegan options Parking: Theres a parking lot down the street and some limited residential parking on the streets around the restaurant",

He made good recommendations, arranged food exactly to the spice level we requested, kept checking on us and promptly arranged everything we ordered. Want to express special thanks to sunny  for making our dinner enjoyable. Thanks also to chef and other staff of this amazing restaurant for the great food and service.

We took a leap of faith, and landed on solid ground! We ordered Chicken Korma and Lamb Bhuna. They were both delicious, very well seasoned and the consistency was just right. The Kormas slightly tangy sweetness and the Lamb Bhunas rich depth of spicy flavors were exactly what we needed. We totally forgot to take photos. In the end, they offered us Gulabjamuns on the house. I personally didnt try it but my friend liked it so much, she had both.",
