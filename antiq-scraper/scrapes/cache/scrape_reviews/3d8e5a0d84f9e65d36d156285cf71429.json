Wanted to get colors for our first wooden paint project, the person was really helpful and gave so much detailed knowledge about different types of colors and  what and when to use.

Thanks to him this project is coming out really good We forgot one of the paint bottle at the payment counter but the lady Name Dolly came all the way to parking lot to give the forgotten color. That kind is service is really rear this days. Thanks again The Home Depot Cambie. For such a great experience.",

I was assisted by Ana Baya and Quentin Millet.  They were both friendly, professional, and highly competent.  They listened to me explain what I needed and they showed a real desire to get everything done properly.  In an era where such fantastic personal service seems to be disappearing, Ana and Quentin have given me hope that there are still people who care about competence and professionalism.

Most staff is amazing, helpful and knowledgeable, but theres also some who are totally lost. Not many, but once you deal a few times with them, you know to avoid. :) parking is underground shared with Save On and they reimburse for parking, at least for now. Overall great.",

Later in the day I was headed to Cambie street to grocery shop and thought that I d try returning the empty package for one with a bulb.  I anticipated that I may not get a return on the empty package due to it being a different HD location as well as it depending on their discretion.  Not only did I get an apology for the empty package; I also received a refund AND a new bulb.  It wasn t until I was on the drive home that I realized I hadn t asked the employee his name.

As it turned out, the self service machine didnt have the blank key I needed so the associate had use the manual machine. His customer service was great. Prices of comparable merchandise at Canadian Tire is probably priced a little better. footnote: The key that the automatic machine cut is really poor- barely works.

There were plenty of staff available to help with finding products and answering questions. There was plenty of stock for the product I was looking for whereas it was sold out it a few stores closer to me. Just be aware that this store, being smaller, I believe doesnt carry lumber and other building materials. They do have a great selection of everything else.

            "review_text": "Make no mistake, this is a small Home Depot. If you were looking for a wider range of construction stuff you need to head to the one on Terminal. However this one has a fantastic location and the staff ratio is a bit better than other places meaning you can usually get more help if you need it. However some of the more detailed departments like electrical and plumbing dont have quite the level of experience as other Home Depots do. But of course that depends on the time and day that you were going. I shop here at least twice a week and in general its well-stocked in all departments unless you need lumber or bigger outdoor stuff. The tool and paint department are especially amazing and have high-quality staff. Not to say that other departments dont... But theyve been exceptional in my ongoing home rental. Parking below is $3 but they comp you $3 off your bill when you check out if you ask. If you need to pick up bits and pieces of things and arent driving, its only one block from the SkyTrain line which makes it exceptional for a lot of people in their daily commute. Hats off to this location!",

Fiona is very friendly and patience because she answered all my question and gave me the right direction where I should go to find the stuff. Thank you for helping me today Fiona.

You can certainly spend the entire day in this area getting everything you need and running all your errands in one place. The Home Depot itself is always immaculately clean, And as usual with the Home Depot stores has a typical layout. This particular store does not have a contractor section so you ll have to go to another location if you re looking for building supplies such as lumber or other building materials. This location as well staffed and seems to cater to the small home renovation DIY as well as the casual home shopper. The stock is actually very good and it carries a lot of seasonal inventory. Despite Covid times, the hours of operation are actually pretty typical and all of the standard Covid precautions are in place and well laid out.

On two occasions, the staff has gone above and beyond and offered excellent customer service. I had to fix a baseboard that was ruined by my dog, and Dieter, I believe his name was, offered to cut the piece to the required measurement.  He even brought it to his home to cut the angle properly, and brought it back the next day for me. Just the other day again, I went back to  look for a patio set. Peter was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this Home Depot location.",
