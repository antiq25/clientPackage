My friends tried the vegetable curry and the chicken , beef, shrimp satay. Its smelled so good. They had a side of rice and a dessert which I cant remember the name. They enjoyed it. I had the chicken biryani and fell in love. Such big pieces on the bone. The sauce was so savory and left a nice after taste. Garlic naan was delicious as well.

So, I thought I would try something different. We had complimentary mini drinks that had mango and some herbs in it. Was reall good and I hope they have it in their menus later. I ordered the Cassava fries and the African Chili Chicken with pili pili sauce. The sides were fries and pili pili corn. I had the Cassava fries with medium spice and it was great. Perfectly fried. I feel it is better than the ones I had at Simbas Grill. Im not sure what pili pili tastes like but the chicken with pili pili tasted really different from the pili pili corn. The sauce for the chicken was delicious. The spice adds up overtime was it wasnt overly spicy. The chicken was moist. The fries were also really crispy and well done. The corn however, were tough and the sauce was different and did not taste as good as the pili pili for the chicken. I had a taste of the Lamb biryani and I felt many Indian places can do the dish better. Im not sure how good their curry is but the 5 stars is for the chili chicken and cassava fries.",

It was lunch and the place was mostly quiet, without much of a vibe but maybe evenings are different. Regardless, it certainly worth at least a few more visits",

They had a separate kids menu which comes with complementary   lollipop candy and 1 juice and 1 Chapman ice-cream cup and a candy....  The kids menu has an activity for them to keep busy while they wait for the the food.  Their service was quick,  they kept us comfortable and kept coming to ask of we were ok and needed anything and finally towards ask if the food was good,  which it was.  We ordered some naan and Mary Bhajias on the side too,  it was overall an amazing experience...  Would recommend anytime!",

            "review_text": "Jambo grill was a pleasure to eat at. The owner of the grill came and greeted us. The service was excellent and did timely checks to see if we needed anything and the place was well decorated. This restaurant is also complete fire for birthdays. They do a complimentary ice cream with little fire sparks coming out of it. They also play a famous happy birthday song that absolutely makes the environment ecstatic. 10/10 would recommend. As for the food. It is well plated and has large portions. but its a little pricey. wouldnt recommend the butter chicken unless u like less creamy butter chicken sauce and a different taste. The biryani is really good and Id def recommend. Id also recommend the Marsala fries and pili pili mogos but they are a bit spicy. the chai taste exactly like African chai which is delicious. Overall good restaurant, aesethically pleasing. dont use the washroom though. Parking: Good amount of of parking. It is tolled parking and on a busy city street however there is residential parking u could use and free parking underground.",

I ordered Dal Bhajia, which is deep fried Lentil pancake shaped fritters. $6.95 for 5 large servings with Coconut chutney. I was offered 2 for 1 on this item so 10 pieces for $6.95!! Available up until 5 pm. Several other items offered at 2 for 1. Ask for details on other items(Veggie Pakoras) Also had Prawn Popsicles for $13 with some Naan. This dish had a nice lemony flavour. The one drawback was there were only 4 prawns. Total was about $20 and easily enough for 2 meals. Specials change every week. Last visit with 5 friends, I ordered my favourites. Dhal Bhajia, Fried Mogo - Cassava Fries, Tandoori Naan. Really good and the waitress suggested I order some Curry to go with it but I declined. We were all offered a free Mango and mint drink that was delicious and lots of free Masala Chai (see Jamvi Yelp listing)",

Should tell ppl to wait outside the restaurant rather than all wait inside, making pickups for delivery drivers and take out orders unsafe to collect the food. Could see people were uncomfortable walking out the door since we were all in close proximity. Staff (I think owner) was touching their face, puts mask on, touches outside of mask then walks to a table and starts talking to ppl while touching the table. There was a table of 6 which didnt look like the same household unless 3 couples of similar age live together or the parents had exactly 3 daughters and 3 sons very close in age. Maybe not the role of restaurant to enforce restrictions on guests but again, made me feel that this place is not safe during covid and Ive been to places where the largest group during this current restrictions was 3, max 4 ppl. felt very uncomfortable so Ill wait until after covid to eat here or takeout. Food was good though. Food was good, service was friendly!!",

I had the Africa Passion (pictured) which was light and refreshing and my mom had something they called a Passionfruit Margarita but absolutely not a margarita. Nevertheless it was SUPER tasty. The bartender has a generous pour, which I appreciate I ordered the lamb biryani. The lamb was sooo tender it shredded just by looking at it   the biryani was basically just saffron rice with delicious stew piled on top, but that could be a regional thing; Im more used to Pakistani biryani.",

I brought a couple of friends to Jambo Grill a few years ago, who used to live in Kenya and they absolutely loved the food. Tonight I just ordered delivery. The Pili Pili Mogos are just so flavourful with a bit of heat. I was intrigued, so I ordered the masala sausage. I havent seen that on their menu before. Delicious! It was crispy outside, juicy inside and very tasty. I ordered the veggie samosas. They were crispy and fresh. Im just surprised that their tamarind chutney comes in packets, like ketchup packets from fast food restaurants. Ill still be ordering again.",

The boneless ribs were a favorite for our group. I dont give out 5 stars very often, so please dont change anything about your food! We will definitely be back (and ordering in).",

This place easily makes my top 3 and on a good day #1! Dont hesitate. Top quality service and food!",

A mix of Indian and South African inspired fare with some really amazing dishes!! (The ribs are awesome).  What really impressed me however, being a fan of spicy food, is that the spice isnt burn-your-mouth and still tasting it hours later.  This is well balanced, flavorful and really easy on the palate.

We didnt know exactly where to go to eat our food when we ate it, but since it was a few hours before closing, the manager let us eat in a corner, while socially distancing (it was only 4 people spaced out). The manager/owner and server at the time were wonderful with their hospitality, the food was amazing, and they went out of their way to provide us with everything we needed. This small gesture made us feel like everything was back to normal for a brief moment, which was almost as good as how amazing their food is, which is truly the best in town. I cannot recommend Jambo enough they have great staff, fantastic ownership, and phenomenal food. Definitely my favorite spot in Vancouver.",
