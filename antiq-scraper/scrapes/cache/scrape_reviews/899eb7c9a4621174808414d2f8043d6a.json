Ive been to a lot of gyms but Anytime Fitness stands out as the most friendly, fun and challenging space there is. I cannot stress enough as to how good the environment is. Just showing up makes you want to work out and the crew is the friendliest of any gym Ive ever come across in my life. I certainly did not go wrong by choosing Anytime Fitness and i know others feel the same as me. This is what fitness should look like. Challenging, exhausting, entertaining and fun.",

The members are all there for the same reason, to grow and better themselves. This is something you would expect is the norm at most gyms, but unfortunately, it s not!! I always look forward to coming to this gym and getting a workout in. If i m ever not feeling my best, my mood is quickly lifted by the friendly staff. When I first started training here, I was very shy and quiet. My main goal was to get my work out done and leave. Almost two years later and I am grateful to call these people my friends. My fitness journey would never be where it is if it weren t for these lovely people who approached me, pushed me out of my shell, and helped me gain confidence. They took the time to educate me on fitness, specifically weightlifting, and helped me when needed, with my form or a spot, etc.  They genuinely care :) That is what makes this gym different.",

Its a busy place with people coming and going and they do a good job enforcing the health & capacity requirements. Equipment is clean and well maintained and I have never had to wait more than about 5 minutes to get in. I decided to sign up with a personal trainer to get me on track and teach me how to use the equipment and that has gone very well. I would recommend a PT for a gym novice....its not cheap, but worth it. It has been well over a month now and I am now comfortable in a gym environment and I always look forward to my next visit.

Membership pricing is fair, and if theres something wrong, they will try to fix it. I havent encountered those stereotypes  where gym will try to upsell you or refuse to cancel membership. Contracts are fair, as long as you go by the contract, they dont give you hard time. Ive been with this gym since it opened in 2013.",
