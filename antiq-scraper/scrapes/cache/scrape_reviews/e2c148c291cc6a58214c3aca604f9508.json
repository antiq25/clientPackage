We ordered calamari, burrata, carpaccio, scallop ravioli, spot prawn spaghetti, mini donuts and a chocolate hazelnut dessert. Everything we had was really good.  The seafood was cooked perfectly! We also ordered non alcoholic mocktails. One of the drinks tasted too much like vanilla so the bar tender came over and made a new drink for my friend. The staff were very friendly and the atmosphere is good.",

This modern Italian restaurant captures the essence of Venetian bacaros beautifully by letting simple ingredients shine in the most delicious ways. The dishes I tried, like the charred octopus and the lightly spiced duck ragu, and the linguine ai gamberi were all exceptional, but what truly stood out was Chef Charlies talent and care. His culinary skills shone through in every bite, making this meal unforgettable. Highly recommended!",

Then later stumbled by it late at 9pm and stopped in and glad we did. It s attached to a hotel sort of but under completely different ownership. Service was even better than the solid food. The one cocktail we ordered was good but they make it in house ahead of time and bottle it, so not my ideal drink but still was very good. Have a small patio that is awesome and inside decor is nice too. Very fair prices so a good value for a nice do inexperience. Hopefully we will be visiting Vancouver again soon.",

Sparing you the minor incident - the restaurant ran out of the small size 20oz Ribeye - the manager made right and gave a small discount on a larger 40oz Ribeye.  Hindsight if I had more than 2 people like 3-4 I would definitely order 40+ oz.  Steak was about 10% fatty and cooked med rare could give Morton s or Ruth s Chris a run for their money.  Accompanied by carrots with chimichurri sauce and rosemary over crisped potatoes and a small side of Rigatoni with olive oils and Parmesan slices - and sprinkle some salt flakes - ciao!!  Delicious!! Thank you Jesse and Morgan for a delightful service and finished with donuts on lemon curd!! I m visiting from Los Angeles - and I travel a lot.  This restaurant is special!! Ciao!!

            "review_text": "This place seriously knows how to bring the flavor and create an amazing atmosphere that had us swooning. First things first, the scallops and raviolo were the real deal.   The combination of delicate scallops and perfectly cooked raviolo had us in foodie heaven. It was like a symphony of flavors that danced on our taste buds, leaving us craving more. And those chicken liver crostini and anchovy crostini? Lets just say they were the definition of gourmet deliciousness. We gotta give a shout-out to their strawberry iced tea because it was the ultimate thirst-quencher.    It was so refreshing, like a fruity oasis in the midst of our dining adventure. Now, lets talk about the spot prawn pasta.    It was a serious game-changer! The spot prawns were cooked to perfection, and the pasta was an explosion of flavors that kept us coming back for more. Trust us, this dish will have you doing the happy dance in your seat. Moving on to the service can we just say that the servers were on point? They were friendly, approachable, and totally on their A-game. They made us feel right at home, and their knowledge of the menu was impressive. Its clear that they take pride in delivering a top-notch dining experience. And lets not forget the ambiance. It was pure romance in every detail. The dim lighting, cozy seating, and overall vibe set the stage for a memorable evening. Whether youre out for a date night or catching up with friends, Bacaros ambiance is on another level. So, if youre looking for a dining spot that hits all the right notes, Bacaro is a must-try. The scallops, raviolo, and crostini will make your taste buds sing, the strawberry iced tea will quench your thirst, and the spot prawn pasta will leave you wanting more. The servers and romantic ambiance are the icing on the cake. Trust us, youll leave with a smile and a full heart (and stomach)!",

            "review_text": "We decided to try out this restaurant because it s Michelin guide reccommended! We ordered the Rosato Spritz, which is house bottled and labelled. Cute touch! It was sweet and easy drinking. Our reservation was for 8:30 and by that time, they were out of their homemade bread and their sirloin. Thankfully they still had a ribeye available. It was my favorite dish of the night! The ribeye is sous vide and finished on the grill which was exquisite - sooo tender. However, we did have to ask for some salt on the side as it was under-seasoned for our liking. In place of the bread & butter, we tries the Saffron Pecorino - very tasty! We enjoyed the accompanying Peach Mostarda - very sweet and strongly flavoured. We were told ahead of time that their Duck Ragu Bigoli is more aldente than we would be used to which was appreciated. It was good but not the favourite of the night. The Fritto Misto was delicious and had great portions! All the assortments of seafood were cooked perfectly. The breading has more of a bite than you would expect. Definitely worth a try! The ambience was dark and intimate.",

They have a great deal on their aperitivo hour where you get a free small snack if you order a drink from the aperitivo menu. In general the staff was great, but shout out to Hector and Logan, both gave us great service and an all around amazing experience.",

Service was friendly but could use a bit of improvement in some areas.  Otherwise a really great experience and will definitely be back.",

            "review_text": "Bacaro is a welcome addition to the Vancouver food scene. High quality familiar Italian ingredients - with a sprinkle of less familiar touches. The subtle touches/inventions are great elevations to traditional dishes. From the menu to wine list (including tasting flights and amaros) there is lots of entertainment to be had. We ve been back twice and we will certainly be returning again. Our initial experience included the risotto and the duck ragu (both excellent, particularly the pasta itself which reminded me of picci pasta in Tuscany). This most recent visit included venison and rosemary ragu rigatoni; chicken (breaded and fried) with polenta, sweet onion reduction, and hen of the woods mushrooms; tiramisu (with preserved cherries and chocolate at the bottom); Piedmonte wine tasting flight; and a side of Taleggio with rhubarb preserve finished with a glass of Cappellano chinoto (a true gem and difficult to source). We were also lucky enough to have a seat on their newly updated patio equipped with heaters. Thank you Zeenah and Hector for making our daughters 1st birthday lunch memorable. Salute!",

Our service was amazing, honestly the perfect waitress for our evening and we would definitely ask to have her again! The food was absolutely to die for we both had the stable fish as our entre and could not have been more pleased. This is an absolute must try for food lovers!!!!!!",

My husband and I love, love, love Bacaro so much! Phenomenal experience each and every time we visited this wonderful place. Consistently outstanding food, which is not a guarantee at so many other restaurants we go to. We tried so many different dishes and so far, we loved each and every one of them. I normally stay away from onions, because they simply dont like me very much, BUT, we both had the Manzo - braised and grilled wagyu beef, balsamic cipollini onion, farm lettuces, and we both thought that the balsamic cipollini onion was as much of the star in this dish as the wagyu beef! Simply delicious! And....for the first time ever, I never experienced any side effects from the onion whatsoever! The staff is truly amazing; knowledgeable, pleasant, friendly and fun! Rebecca made our experience fun, beautiful and memorable. Top notch atmosphere and vibe! We cant wait to go back again, again and again... Petra Belavic is the general manager at Bacaro, and was amazed that she reached out just to thank me for the feedback, and to let her know if there was anything she could do for us in the future. So caring, so wonderful.... these are the experiences that make ALL the difference, Thank you! Many THANKS Petra, to you and to your wonderful staff for all the wonderful work you do and for making it so easy to leave positive feedback and reviews like this!  Keep up the amazing job you are doing! We will see you again very, very soon! J and C, Vancouver",

Make sure you ask your server to go through the menu  with you if you aren t familiar with bacaros! Fantastic food from start to finish! We enjoyed a variety of cicchetti (small cocktail snacks) to kick off our evening. Some of our favourites were the butter and anchovy, Buffalo mozzarella, and polpettes, which paired well with my refreshing V&T. Appetizer favourites include the beef carpaccio, smoked sablefish, and insalata di cicoria. For the mains, I loved the fresh bigoli pasta, risotto, and octopus. Don t forget to finish with the gianduiotto (semifreddo) to end on a sweet note. I love the transformation that the Kitchen Table group completed. It s a beautiful space with such a great atmosphere and energy. Look around closely to see all the fine details they ve put into this bacaro. I ve already been there a couple of times within a week and a half  the food, room, and staff all make it a wonderful experience :) Big shoutout to Lisa, Emma, and Brad!",
