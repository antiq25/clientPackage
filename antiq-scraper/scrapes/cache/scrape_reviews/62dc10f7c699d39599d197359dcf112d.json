They have an extensive beer menu (as you would expect). The food menu is also extensive with fairly typical food options for this type of establishment (burgers, wings, pizza, etc.). I had the 1/2 ribs and they were phenomenonal. The meat was super tender and just fell off the bone. What made the accompanying fries so good was a tomato/garlic dipping sauce, which was sublime. They should bottle and sell that stuff! Im not sure what the rest of the menu was like, but for the ribs alone its worth trying! The service as slick and professional. I could easily have stayed for a couple more beers if I wasnt fighting jetlag.",

            "review_text": "If you go, I dont know if youre going to love it. What I can tell you is that when I went it was perfection. Yes, perfection. Ill tell you why. It was a chill weekend lunch and we stopped by for just a burger, lager and a small appetizer. Our server (Sally) was absolutely lovely. She waited on us hand and foot and did it with a smile the entire time, and she had other tables and watching her conduct herself with such quality consistency was refreshing. So, thats for the service. Now the food. The YBC Cheeseburger was everything I look for in a cheeseburger. Juicy, well-seasoned, smart ingredient proportionality and it was actually hot when it arrived, which very rarely happens with burger dishes. Burgers arriving at the table hot is like a Unicorn....no, Ive never seen a Unicorn, but you know what I mean.... The fries...well..the fries were everything a fry should be. It was crispy on the outside, cooked with quality oil and steaming hot and flakey on the inside while you bit in and seasoned just right. Technically it was a perfect serving of fries and it tasted absolutely amazing. Honestly, I was almost going to order a second serving of just fries, but you know.....calories and all that... The Fish tacos for once were cooked the way they are supposed to be cooked if youre not trying to rip your guests off. Perfect ratio of batter and fish, which means you tasted the beautiful juicy cod as the primary source of flavour while the batter complimented and served as a finish to its protein counterpart. Oh!....and it was so very fresh! The lager was yummy, they make their own stuff and I had a second one. I think youll have a great experience. Id be surprised if you dont. They cant be this good and be inconsistent.",

This brewpub has it all, from a fantastic selection of beers brewed in-house to a menu with delicious options. But what really sets Yaletown Brewing Co. apart is the incredible service provided by their staff. When we were planning a large group gathering, we reached out to the restaurant for help with reservations. Anushree and Natasha went above and beyond to ensure that our experience was smooth and stress-free. They were friendly, responsive, and accommodating, and we couldnt have been happier with their service. When we arrived, we were greeted warmly and shown to our tables promptly. The atmosphere was lively and inviting, and the menu offered something for everyone. We sampled a few of the brews on tap, and they were all so good. Overall, we had a wonderful experience at Yaletown Brewing Co., and were grateful to Anushree and Natasha for making it all possible. We highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a great meal and a great time in Vancouver!",

            "review_text": "** UPDATE ** After a speedy response from management we were promptly invited back and overall had an amazing experience with great food, drinks, and above and beyond service! Aisha and Tristen were professional and accommodating, and we couldn t be happier with the overall experience. Updated our rating accordingly. ** We ate at this establishment last night and will not be returning. If I could give zero stars I would. TL;DR: Extremely poor management, unclear billing, and poor treatment of staff! Ill start this off by saying our server was extremely sweet and none of this review is to reflect her in anyway. I called roughly an hour before to try and book a reservation, but was told they do not do same day reservations, but they accept walk ins. Ok no problem. So I asked if it was currently busy and if there would be a long wait to which I was told, I dont know, I cant tell you. Followed by the hostess hanging up on me. Fast forward an hour and there was less than 7 tables occupied in the entire restaurant when we arrived. We were seated outside next to one of their growler displays and while we were waiting for our food I noticed a live mouse running inside the glass display. Not the prettiest sight to see before eating your meal, however, the waitress moved us tables without any hesitation. Secondly, my girlfriend wished to substitute chicken instead of steak in her dish, which was confirmed as not a problem by the kitchen for a small upcharge. Little did we know that small upcharge was $9.44 for 4 THIN STRIPS of a chicken breast on top of the $24 original bowl price. See attached photo and try and find the entire chicken breast. Lastly, after our bill had come to $150, the manager had brought out our to go food order, and we asked a question regarding the cost for chicken, to which she rudely replied we do not do substitutions so we have to upcharge to make it work. Is chicken not cheaper than steak? If anything this establishment just saved money by giving chicken instead of steak as the protein in this meal. Furthermore, we ordered two orders of their honey siracha wings,  one came to $17.85 and the other $15.27, why you might ask? No one knows. Seeing that my girlfriend was rightfully annoyed by this, the manager said she would be right back. A few moments later our waitress came back to us with $10 cash and apologized for her mistake. What mistake you might ask? Your guess is as good as mine, but if you ask management it was probably the servers mistake not telling us there would be a $10 upcharge on the meal. To which my girlfriend asked her did they make you give us this money out of your own pocket? and the waitresses response was less than lack luster. Well... yes but it was my fault. We insisted that she keep the $10 because thats absurdly ridiculous of management to make the waitress pay out of her own pocket for that. If the billing and rude manager wasnt reason enough for us not to return, the way management treated our waitress and forced her to pay out of her own pocket was the deciding factor. We will not be returning.",

I had the YBC Cheeseburger and he doesn t remember the exact name of his but said it was something like BBQ brisket sandwich. Anyway, both were delicious and the food also came out extremely quickly! We had a great experience!! We were also surprised that they were able to fit us in on such short notice (we were walkins) but they sat us right on the patio and we got immediate service. Amazing job!!",

            "review_text": "UPDATE (5 stars): Well that was totally unexpected. I was given an email to make a claim, and I was promised I would get refunded in the coming days after I contacted them. I decided to change my review to 5 stars because there was nothing wrong with the beers and more importantly, not many restaurant do a follow up with their clients to make amend. It felt good to know someone somewhere is listening. ORIGINAL (1 Star): We had beer only and realized after I got home I was charged a Moscow Mule by server with initial B. Make sure you check your bill before you leave the restaurant. Lesson learned.",
