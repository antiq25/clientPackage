The food tasted pretty good, I especially liked the calamari batter and seasoning as well as the noodle broth flavour. The appetizers are a bit on the pricey side but the rest of the menu seems to be priced like other similar restaurants. The service was good as well.",

The taiwanese food is authentic and so delicious. Ive had the sausage fried rice with egg which was good, the fried rice with egg is delicious. The clear broth beef noodle is incredible and the fried chicken is also so yummy I also had their spicy tofu and minced pork on rice and that was good. Ive also had their pig ears that were very authentic as well. No issues or complaints all 3 experiences. The only inconvenience is debit/cash only!",

            "review_text": "Pretty good Taiwanese food overall. Highly recommend the Taiwanese meatball which is a delicacy most restaurants don t offer. It is a tasty meatball made with pork and bamboo shoots and other good flavoured stuff wrapped in a chewy, bouncy, starchy coating similar to a mochi texture. It s almost like a giant dumpling and it is delicious. The beef noodle soups with thick noodle were just average because there was a thick layer of oil on the soup that was too greasy (if they could just skim off the oil it would be much better in my opinion so you can get to the tasty broth without so much oil). The noodles were also overdone to the point they would snap when you picked it up and they were mushy to eat. The noodles were so soft you couldn t even chew them. The deep fried pork intestines were very tasty but the portion was quite small for what you pay. The milk teas were average. The Taiwanese deep fried chicken nuggets tasted authentic.",

The fried rice was excellent, as was the popcorn chicken and calamari. The 2-item combo would have been great if they just threw in a bowl of plain rice, instead of just giving basically $1 off two items. The daily meal combo needed $3 extra for a drink, which IMHO isnt much of a deal but maybe Im just too cheap... :of Overall, very glad they are here and will go back again.

            "review_text": "When this restaurant was still in Burnaby 20 years ago, my friends and I used to drive a long way to eat there because it was probably the only place where we could truly taste authentic Taiwanese food. A few days ago, I heard from a friend that this restaurant was opening in Vancouver, and we were filled with excitement. On the day of their official opening, to avoid the crowded crowd, we arrived at five oclock. The restaurants decor is simple, but the advertising slogans and pictures on the walls are quite interesting. We ordered some Taiwanese snacks that we had been longing for, including TW Meatball W Pork Bamboo Shoot, Deep Fried Boneless Chicken Thigh Rice, Spicy Pork Ear Slice, and MARINATED BAMBOO SHOOTS. All the dishes still retained the authentic Taiwanese style and flavor. We all enjoyed our meal. When it was time to pay, because they were newly opened, they were selling a Super Value Coupon Book, buy 50 get 50. Each five-dollar voucher came with a note: $5 Vouchers can only be used per person per transaction. I even asked the staff at that time how to use them. However, to our surprise, when we went to eat there again yesterday, the staff insisted from start to finish that the three of us could only use two five-dollar vouchers. This statement completely contradicted the clear and straightforward rule: $5 Vouchers can only be used per person per transaction. When we asked the staff for an explanation, she said, We have always done it this way. Always? You just opened recently. We feel this is a deceptive practice and are very disappointed. We hope this company can provide a reasonable explanation. Note: Thank you, owner , for such a quick response and for resolving our concerns so clearly. I believe excellent quality and honest treatment of customers are important driving forces for a prosperous business.",

            "review_text": "If you are going to limit the number of $5 coupons you can use, you should have made that clear in your promotional materials. You should not change the terms of your promotion after the fact, much less tell your customers that they misunderstood the rules. Nowhere does it say you can only use maximum two $5 coupons. One per customer per transactions should mean exactly that. The food was just okay, but unfortunately I have to come back again to use up all the coupons. Shady business practice.",
