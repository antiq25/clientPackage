The service was great, with attentive staff who were knowledgeable and helpful with providing recommendations. The food was amazing!  The chicken were juicy and flavorful! However, they are still a bit spicy for me even though I ordered plain.  We loved the halloumi cheese and that yummy egg dessert too!!! Plus the cozy ambiance added an extra touch of comfort to the dining experience. Highly recommended!",

The chicken was perfectly grilled and seasoned with Nandos signature flavors, offering a delicious and slightly spicy kick. The rice was fluffy and well-cooked, complementing the chicken beautifully. What truly stood out, though, was the excellent customer service. The staff was welcoming, attentive, and ready to assist with any requests. They made my dining experience even more enjoyable. Overall, Nandos chicken and rice bowl not only satisfied my taste buds but also left me impressed with their top-notch customer service. Ill definitely be returning for more.",

I went to this restaurant simply because I am craving for some chicken but surprisingly their food is superb! The chicken flavor is authentic and the variety of their sauces are exquisite, surely a good pair with their grilled chicken. The chicken is moist and the rice is cooked into perfection. The service are over the top, the staff are very hospitable which I enjoyed. Love the overall experience and will definitely come back here again.",

Everything was super tasty: the chicken was well cooked with an amazing chargrill flavour (until we tasted yours, we had given up the idea of being able to eat a good rotisserie chicken in Vancouver), the garlic mashed potatoes was really well seasoned, the garlic bread was good though the portion was a bit small, the fries were good quality and the best of the meal was definitely the natas... So perfect! Im a former pastry chef and can tell you these little treats are paradise - theres a crispy crust, the whole thing is then melting in your mouth and you can only become addicted to this amazing taste!! Thanks Nandos for having offered us such a wonderful lunch today, youre definitely our new fav chicken spot of Van!!",

Ive only tried the 1/4 chicken and Peri Peri fries, but its just so good that I havent been able to bring myself to try something else! When you arrive, the hostess will give you a table. Then you order and pay for your food from the front counter and gather your cutlery and condiments from a side area before returning to your table. Once your food is prepared, a server will bring out your food to your table and will occasionally check on you to see if you need anything else. Its a bit of a different system, but it works.",

I am impressed at how the three different Nandos I have been in, in Ireland, England and here in Vancouver, have all been such high quality from the interior and music, staff and delightedly the food! Despite the food taking longer than expected, the staff simply came down and told me it would take a bit longer, which was totally fine. I appreciated them coming down, and thats all they had to prevent small little thing like delayed food turning into a disaster experience. The food was delicious once it arrived! Well worth the wait. I ordered the half chicken and peri fries. I think they even gave me extra chicken because of the wait. Some of the nicest I have ever tasted! Freshly cooked and succulent. Great Staff Great atmosphere Delicious food Im looking forward to my next visit. Nandos has definitely acquired me as a fan! :) Thank you!",
