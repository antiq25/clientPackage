I got to meet the owner, Kamo himself. Such a nice guy! He immediately knew that it was my first time and he gave a me a piece of their Baklava for free AND I LOVED IT! It was my first time and Ive only seen baklavas on TV.   It was so good! Ive had my eyes fixed on their pistachio cookies and bought a couple to take home. It was indeed a positive experience for me! Ill definitely be back to try the rest of their selections! If I could give 6 stars here, I would! EDIT: Added pictures on the review",

Also dont sleep on the pistachio cookies - they taste like pistachio Nutella and melt in your mouth when consumed with your choice of milk. The owner is also super friendly, happy to explain what the different types of baklava are and proud of his baked goods. Definitely makes me happy to support and glad theyre not too far away so I can drop by a sweet treat.",

Super nice and friendly man (thank You!!) said he can make a box of mixed baklava, and that he will also put a small gift to try - Royal Paklava - it was soooo good, a lot of flavourful filling, not too sweet, it is PERFECT Walnut & Pistachio Baklavas also well balanced in flavors and structure, the top is perfectly crispy, great filling, soft inside, sweetness level is perfect for me (most baklavas I tried in Vancouver before were super sweet and had less filling so couldn t even notice nuts flavour). Definitely recommend to try! :)",

            "review_text": "I discovered Kamo bakery while I was walking to an appointment. I immediately walked in to check it out. The man at the counter was very helpful and kind. Ive had Baklava before and they sell something similar called, Paklava. I was hesitant to try it because the baklava I had was sticky, chewy and way too sweet. He said, ours is different. Im so glad I tried it. It was absolutely delicious. It was crispy, buttery and not cloyingly sweet. Delicious!!! I ended up buying 6 pieces that day. They also had pomegranate molasses. I bought a bottle of that too. I cant wait until they have Knafeh. He said they will have it soon. EDIT: I went to this bakery again and the service is consistently friendly and welcoming. I love their Walnut Paklava. I bought a pound of it this time. I am also in love with their breads and orange cookies.",

            "review_text": "Everything the other review says are right! The owner is definitely the sweetest thing in the shop as all their pastries are made with low sugar. After hearing its my first time there, the owner was so enthusiastic to introduce to me what they have and giving me a couple of samples to try. It was a very heart warming gesture. First the baklavas, the sweetness is only about 1/2 or less than the other baklavas out there, I can finally taste the true taste of the baklavas without filling my mouth with syrup. My husband absolutely loves it. My absolute favorites in the shop is the sesame cake and the dates pastry. Sesame cake tastes really fragrant and addictive. You dont get sick and tired of the taste at all. The texture is more like a cookie. The date pastry is quite different from the other places Ive tried and definitely my second choice from the shop. The orange chocolate cookie is another must have if you are a chocolate person. Its got such a strong dark bitter chocolate taste to it youll feel like youre eating dark chocolate itself. The texture was also really good. It has a combination of cookies and brownies texture making it nice and moist but still crunchy. Everything is priced by weight (baklava costs more). I think on average, each pc will cost around $1. This place is a bit out of my way, but with this quality, Im ok to make a trip there more often now",

This little gem does not disappoint in fact you won t find more authentic-breads or pastries anywhere in western Canada. No cheap ingredients at Kamo Baker and you can taste the quality! Once you try it you ll refuse to settle for anything less  I live 4 hours away and we always stock up every-time we are in town. #1 Baklava #1 Date filled cookies and #1 tandoori Bread (Saj). always fresh even when I freeze and thaw!!! Absolutely love this place!!!",

            "review_text": "Highly recommended!!! What sets this gem apart is its commitment to using only the finest, most authentic ingredients, giving every item a distinct and genuine flavor.  Their Pistachio and Walnut Baklawas, alongside the irresistible Kulicha, exude a tantalizing blend of honey and organic butter, unveiling a taste that is simply unparalleled. Since my first encounter with their treats a few months ago, I find myself unable to satisfy my cravings anywhere else. Kamos devotion and unwavering integrity to his craft truly sets this bakery apart. Kamo definitely deserves all the praise for his honesty and integrity in his work.",

It was not dipped into the syrup so I can not be seen as original baklava, but it was amazing that even thought its not original or sweet. It has an insane amount of flavour of pistachio and walnut. Moreover, the owner of this place is so kind and have a good energy that I wanted to go again! MUST TRY PISTACHIO BAKLAVA!!",

We had seen the sign up for several months and were curious to know what would be opening in this unprepossessing space on the drive. We happened to walk by the other day and they were open, so we ventured in. Its a tiny bakery run by some lovely and friendly Syrians, with a selection of fresh Syrian breads and baklava. We asked some questions, which were answered enthusuastically and we bought a bag of their freshly baked flatbreads (Samoon) and an assortment of their pastries. They also gave us a small bag of bonus bread. It was their opening day, which can sometimes mean things go wrong. Not here! The flatbreads were great. Light and airy - perfect with falafels or charcuterie - whatever you like. The star of the show, however, is the pastries. The baklava is light, crisp, fresh and not too sweet or drowned in syrup, which is all too common, especially at Persian bakeries. There were also the most delicious sesame squares and date pastries. Try them all - nothing was disappointing. If they keep this standard up, they deserve to be very successful. They have opened in a difficult spot, but they deserve support and we will return there next time we are on Victoria Drive. Grab some pastries and have them with some good coffee. Heaven!",

Seeing so many excellent reviews of Kamos baklavas, I was actually excited to try it for myself. I was not disappointed. We got both types, the walnut and the pistachio. They are both amazing--just the right amount of sweetness and not greasy at all! Its so incredibly well done, flaky and buttery--these baklavas are not pastries they are art! We loved them so much the next day my husband ordered some to bring to work to share. Everybody loved them. The baklavas are so spectacular I almost forgot to mention their other sweets and the owner. The owner--Ive got to ask for his name next time--is super nice. As a first timer in the bakery, he offered to let us try anything were interested. We ended up trying almost everything and buying a whole bunch of different sweets. In total we got 12 baklavas and a small box of assorted cookies. We finished them in 3 days, just the two of us! They are lethal because you dont feel guilty eating them at all. Its a joy to discover small neighbourhood gems like Kamo. It makes you appreciate the little things in life that much more.",

With least amount of sugar,  I grabbed a pound of mixed ones. I am glad I did that. My wife really likes the stuffed pastry with walnut and dates.

Great selections of sweet treats, the sugar free options were extremely delicious as well. Definitely try the Baklava, it was just prefect, not too sweet or syrupy. Its a family run business which is another reason to support them!",
