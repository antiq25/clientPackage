            "review_text": "So fun! I highly recommend Fright Nights for Halloween, they add haunted houses and actors to bring the Halloween experience alive! There are rice and haunted house wait times but it s worth the wait. The park is especially beautiful at night when everything is lit up. There is fun theme park food options and rides for a range of ages and comfort levels. It s easy to get to by transit and there is lots of parking across the street. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for thrills and fun!",

            "review_text": "I visited to Playland Amusement Park in winters during Fright Night. It was a thrilling experience. The Halloween theme added an exciting twist to the park. Everywhere you turned, you were immersed in a ghostly atmosphere with lots of haunted houses, making it perfect for the spooky season. Its a unique and fun way to celebrate Halloween with family and friends, providing a memorable and spine-tingling adventure. It was very crowded at this Fright night event, especially during the second week of Halloween-themed festivities. With the popularity of the event, its important to plan ahead, arrive early, and be prepared for larger crowds.",

Also We had to wait longer then expected to try certain games reached more than 30 minutes which made our chances less to enjoy all the games. But it was fun to be there and my kids enjoyed.",

            "review_text": "The PNE (Pacific National Exhibition) is undeniably a wonderful place for family outings, but our recent visit left us with a mixed bag of experiences. While the overall enjoyment was high, there were a few hiccups along the way. One aspect that could be improved is the pricing. The entry fees and the requirement for thrill passes can add up, making it a bit pricey for families. Additionally, some of the rides, including the wooden roller coaster and the hellevator, were out of service during our visit. This resulted in longer lines for the kid-friendly rides, which was a bit frustrating. On a brighter note, the farm exhibition was a big hit with the kids. The variety of animals, from cows to water buffalo, offered a fantastic learning experience. The magic show, pig races, and the real knight fight with horses were thrilling and entertaining. Plus, the free ice cream was a delightful treat. The PNE does offer a silver lining in that you can enjoy the shows and exhibitions with just a general admission ticket, which is a money-saving option. Despite a few setbacks, our day at the PNE was filled with memorable family moments and a wide range of entertainment options, making it a worthwhile destination for families looking for a fun day out.",

Should have gone earlier as wasnt able to get to do everything, given had to eat and rest and all that. Speaking of food, highly recommend bringing extra snacks as everything is ridiculously expensive: $7 for cotton candy, $21 for 5 chicken strips/fries/juice (see photo - those are large fries), etc etc. There were water refill stations, so bringing a water bottle helps keep you hydrated. Or to pour over your head. Premises was kept very clean and there were cooling fans blowing cold mist. 2 parking lots within walking distance available for $15.",

Line ups are easily 45 minutes each ride and you only get to be there for 6 hours which means you essentially only get access to 6 rides. I liked it better when you were able to go for the whole day and got to take your time and could chose if you wanted to go at 12:30pm and leave at 7pm. Or whenever. The day was yours.

We went in blazing heat, 33deg that day... Luckily had hats and re fillable bottles for water, which we used to douse our heads and backs repeatedly. I eat a strict ketogenic diet, so I brought all my own food in. They didnt even check my small cooler. We LOVED the legends of Drag show!!!!      So wonderful I took my two kids, ages 3 and 10 and my sister too. Great times had by all!",

(   drop a like) I went on the last day of the fair and ride passes and coupons were sold out, which was quite confusing, never seen it happen before. We were given a map when we got in to check out the events. Its important to stick to the schedule so you make the most of the place. Unfortunately, my group made it on time at 7pm to the horse show, only to have it never happen. Expect to spend many many dollars at the fair. Every single business will ask for a tip on top of marked up prices, and the fun archery activity will cost you. Every interactice activity will cost you",

Recommend the Rapid Pass ride option to save countless hours of waiting on line for the ride of your choice, with some lines being 1-3 hour wait makes the rapid pass the best way to go with limited amount of passes available per day. Ride pass is separate from gate pass so be sure to purchase both tickets with rapid pass upgrade available at the ride ticket purple roof booths, haunted house or the odd ride attraction are not covered under ride passes or PNE gift cards with a separate individual charge per person. Have fun and enjoy everything that PNE has to offer! Make sure you bring water bottles for the refill stations, lockers available for your needs, debit or credit only as not much cash is acceptable throughout the park. Thank you",

            "review_text": "The PNE was spectacular. We arrived at 2pm next thing we were leaving at closing 11pm. We went on many rides like, atmosphere, swings, hellavator, the beast, pirate ship, unfortunately the ol wooden Rollercoaster was closed for renovation. The rides were all shuffled in together not spread out like past years, but I liked it didnt have to walk around so far to repeat rides. Plus there was limited capacity which was fine, no long line ups. There was live music shows all day. We seen Super Dogs, my fav. The pyrotechnics & firework show was Amazing!! At one point the fireworks blasted strait into the audience. Of course, it had a designated safety point to land at but it sure felt like we were goin to get blasted. Id def. see that again, and for free. Spectacular!!The food vendors had a good variety of food, like BBQ, tacos, hotdogs, burgers, fries, oh and dont forget, the best viewing homemade in ur face, just before leaving fresh warm mini donuts. There was anime store selling mystery bags, kids thought it was awesome. Booking online for admission and ride wrist bands made it alot easier, didnt have long lineups. If I go on Ill be writing a book. It was a great time and were going back for Playland in a couple weeks. Thanks PNE!!",

For one, the PNE is right there with lots of food and entertainment options, but that s besides the point. Within playland proper you have all the carnival games you could desire, some decent food options, mini golf, and honestly a pretty dope selection of rides. The wooden rollercoaster is still my favourite coaster of all time, rivalled only by the cyclone at cony island (similar vibe). It s a very old coaster that feels as though it can break down at any moment- this only adds to the experience. Other great options include the hellavator and the beast, but that s not all, try going on fright nights for the haunted houses, you WILL definitely wet your pants.",

But if you buy an adult ride pass you can ride all the rides as many times as you can . All the big rides do have at least a 5 ride wait , but some of them are sooooo worth it . There is quite an assortment of food , I recommend the deep fried onions if you like onion rings these are so much better . And have a great time  we did . Ps it is a long day but if you are  with the right people you WILL have a GREAT time . Check out the last show as well its the pyro show and lots of fun to watch .",

            "review_text": "PNE Fair usually happens mid-to-late August, and ends in early September, usually on Labour Day. For the past few years, they are closed on Mondays due to lack of attendance in past fairs. There are many ways in saving for admission. They do offer free admission days (X2 days), library day (show a valid library card), VanCity members (show your VanCity Credit Union card) and so on. Just check PNE.ca for deals. Parking is $20 unless you want to pay the little old ladies hawking parking spots on their properties. Transit is also good too. Free parking is available, just have to look for them about several blocks away (just make sure you pay attention to the street signs, or else pay $150 parking fine!) Games? Different games offer different prizes. Maybe I didnt notice in previous years, but the smaller kid games is guaranteed a prize. More or less, you are paying for the stuff animal. So, $5 gets a small prize to $20 get you a jumbo one. I think this is such a smart move on the PNE Fair, cuz its a money grabber but also, encourage kids to play!? My game that I play is whack-a-mole. Scored 2 jumbo stuffed animals for $10, but you need at least 9-11 players. Food? Beer? Drinks? Always expensive. The mini donuts have gone up in price this year. It 1 bag $5, 2 for $10 or 3 for $13. In 2018, it was 3 bags for $10! I guess oil has gone up! But, overall, its the experience. Marketplace? What amazes me is people go nuts for the steam mops, air coolers, chair massagers. Toon City? A different children experience. My kids highlight of the day. The dancers were awesome especially this one lone guy. Then another show on the Super Academy. Very eventful. Barn yard: same thing every year, barn animals, discovery kids tour to horse riding, blacksmith show and so on. So thankful for the sinks to wash those hands!? Rides? I cant say much on this, as my kids a bit young for them. Sure, they got children rides, but its super pack. I would rather come during Playland when its quieter and shorter lines!? Arcade? Its gone. Boarded up and the main entrance is block by the how strong you can hit game. Dog show? The stroller parking is crazy. Great to park it, crazy after the show. The staging area is now 3/4 the ice rink. Which means less seats. White Spot is in the Coliseum, so you can eat in an air condition seating area! Concerts? Two concerts. The paid one vs the free ones. The paid ones reserved seats  vs general admission)  happens at 830pm, namely a past headliner. This years headliner were Billy Idol, Smokey Robinson, Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer, TLC (although, Lisa Lopez passed away, so its only TC), etc. The free ones are basically bands playing radio hits. Not bad actually. Either case, you can find a spot and guarantee you can enjoy the music still. One thing I did notice for 2019 is the PNE has upgraded its fairgrounds. How? New blacktop among some of the rides, newer looking amusement games. PNE is amazing at night with the games and rides shining through. Before I go, and I always wanted to work at the PNE so I can say, win a house, win a car, get your tickets here!",
