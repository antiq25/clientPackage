When we started to realize that we were not being delivered the amount of ice that we were being billed for and there were trust issues, we turned to Dex at Dang Good ice. We have used Dang good Ice for 3 years now, in that time I have been able to trust that I am always getting what I have paid for and Dex at Dang Good Ice is just a text away when we require a delivery. Most importantly Dex is always there when he says he will be. I highly recommend this company and their great service. Thanks for being Dang Good",

I even had to call him during the event for an emergency delivery of more ice cubes as I ran out mid way through the event and pulled through with no hesitation.

            "review_text": "Went to the gas station to get gas and thought it would be easier just to get ice there. Unfortunately was told that they had no more ice and also was informed by the attendant that I would have a hard time finding some due to the heat wave. I was busy at the time getting the food and  supplies for my camping trip, now driving around finding ice was the last thing I wanted to do. So I decided to look up for companies that sell ice, to my surprise I clicked on this certain link and it caught my attention. The crazy thing about this is that the place was 20 meters away from my location. Feeling like a kid from a candy shop,  I had the choices of different type of ice I wanted. They explained to me the best type of ice to use cause I told them I was going camping. Using a block of ice to keep your food or beverage cold in a cooler goes goes way further than getting ice cubes on a bag. Found that out quickly when I was at the camp ground and that fellow friends ice were already melting and their coolers were filled with water. Very appreciated from their tips and the price of ice is a  way better deal than any local stores. They just deal with ice and the people or business that need it. Quick and simple. Know now and my friends where to go .",
