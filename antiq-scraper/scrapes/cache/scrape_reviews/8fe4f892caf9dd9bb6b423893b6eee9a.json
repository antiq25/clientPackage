I definitely enjoyed my first timer experience here. Without a doubt, this place is an excellent choice to either lose track of time with your friends, or to just stop in for a quick pint after work.",

Located on a quiet street just off SE Marine Drive, this charming brewery has a amazing selection of local and organic beers, a cozy bar & tasting room, friendly staff and an overall fantastic vibe!  And even if youre not a beer drinker theyve got a great selection of ciders and other specialty drinks.  I highly recommend their new alcoholic Kombucha brew!",

Maybe it s just me but I seem to run into the all to familiar hipster that looks down his nose at you. Not these two ladies! They were friendly and patient. Answered all our questions with a smile. Our whole group was impressed! Karaoke night is not usually a draw for me but the staff made it fun and we ll all be back! Great job Dogwood! A hidden gem off the beaten brewery path but they certainly left the attitude on the other side of town.",
