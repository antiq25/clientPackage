This place did satisfy my expectations and I really recommend it for any stay in Vancouver. The kitchen was shared with two other rooms, but me and my daughter had dinner out and left before breakfast. It is close to the sky train, bus, and Oakridge mall is a 7 minute walk. Its also close to a beautiful park. I will definitely be coming back to stay!",

Even my single room was spacious enough. The kitchenette comes well equipped with hob, fridge and microwave. Crockery and cutlery is also supplied. Theres also a common kitchen upstairs. A TV in the room would have been preferred. If you are a pedestrian then location could be a challenge.  Like many areas of Vancouver redevelopment is killing the local stores and supermarkets so you need to travel further. A 10 minute walk takes you to excellent transit options. A car would open up even more choice. Not remotely accessible due to being an older home.",
