            "review_text": "I came across this place when searching for halal options in Vancouver and this place did not disappoint. While it is somewhat small inside the food here was incredible. The sandwiches were very large with a lot of meat on them and the flavors and textures they added made these sandwiched unique in their own way. The fries here were also really good as they were very crisp on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. I would definitely recommend anyone that is passing by to come and eat here.",

            "review_text": "Exquisite food and service! They greeted us warmly at the entrance and took us to our table promptly. We had the XD burger, steaks, fries, and top gun. The burger buns were homemade as they meticulously explained. The beef patty was VERY DELICIOUS,  and juicy.  the steak was so smooth, and the sauce served along made it a memorable foodie experience. On the other hand, service was 10/10. They listened attentively to our feedback and was constantly making sure that all customers were satisfied with their experience. We thought the food to be a bit expensive when we first glanced at the menu, but we left thinking it was worth every penny. Will definitely go back!",

Filled with so much flavor and has a nice spice to it. The consomme and the garlic sauce on the side was also delicious. Sad that it s only around for a limited time but it s definitely a must try! My only complain was the service, the waitresses took a while to come take our orders as well as give our bills. However the food did come quite fast which was nice. Another down side is the fact that there s no toilet in the restaurant. Other than that, great food!!",

The restaurants biggest plus point for me is the fact that they offer halal options, which can be hard to come by. The beef and chicken dishes were both flavorful and cooked to perfection, with just the right amount of crispiness and warmth. The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating, making our dining experience all the more enjoyable. The restaurant was very well managed in terms of seating and orders, which is always a plus. Located near English Bay, Vonns is definitely worth a visit if youre in town. Overall, I would highly recommend Vonns to anyone looking for a delicious and authentic halal dining experience. The food is top-notch, the staff are friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. 5 stars!",

From the super friendly service to the quality of the food and we couldn t even finish our cheesesteak and x3 patty Burger   (that I destroyed later at home lol) and it s such a nice restaurant with great views of English bay and the area. No question we will be coming back!, Cheers!",

Great flavour, perfect amount of sauce and cheese, soft bun. The truffle scoop fries were crispy with some thicker, more wedge sized pieces, seasoned well but they didnt come with a sauce so they were on the drier side. Twice as much as I would spend on 2 items like this but it really is a great sandwich!",

They have a patio area with umbrellas, as well as a shaded indoor seating area, but the whole restaurant is open to the bay so you get plenty of sun and noise from the beach. Food was fantastic, I dont know if Id go with the truffle cheesesteak again (its savory enough without the truffle  ), but the staff were friendly and accommodating, if a little busy. Wheelchair accessibility: They have a patio that opens right onto the sidewalk, with a pretty wide opening in the fence, and there are no elevation changes inside the seating area. Not sure if the washroom is accessible.",

The burger was great too, one of the best simple burgers I ve had. Prices are so reasonable. Only thing I think I would change is the menu, it s a little small.

The water for $2.35 on the menu is definitely a turn off, bring your own bottle :)",

We ended up ordering The Rocket to share, which was my favourite item and something I highly recommend. We also ordered The XD burger and a Chic Halloumi Sando. Both of those were also really good and left us very full. The service is also great, with some really friendly staff members. Also, everything on the menu is halal so to anyone visiting Vancouver looking for halal restaurants, this is the spot! Easy 5 stars.",

Find myself a halal-certified gourmet burger restaurant in Vancouver after only having Mediterranean/Persian foods whenever I eat out Officially had my first burger in Canada at Vonns Denman and it definitely set a high bar already! I tried their special menu of the week which is the XD burger. Premium beef patty coated with seasoned melted cheese. I was a bit surprised because it was a bit spicy but as a spicy food lover, my tongue like the flavor burst of it! The portion was more than decent, I guess it will keep you full until the next day . You should try to dip your burger and fries to the mayo-like sauce next to the ketchup, it adds some bold flavor-enhancing kicks to both of them!! Definitely will come back to try out their steak    and chicken burgers",

Simple, juicy and greasy! Their menu keeps it simple as well. It can be found and vonns.com. The Chicken Burgers are MASSIVE. Easily two chicken breasts worth of meat. Ive had a taste of the steak sandwich too and it is pretty good. The portions are massive here and will definitely fill you up. I typically go for a classic if Im not too hungry, a double if Im pretty hungry and a Daredevil (triple patty) if Im feeling dangerous. The Truffle Fries are a MUST try. Soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and paired with their dip is chefs kiss. Regular fries just dont cut it anymore for me. The service is excellent with the staff always friendly and patient waiting to answer any questions you have. The place has great decor that appears to change seasonally as well as a very clean interior with plastic dividers. They have a covered outside area and some indoor seating and the location is less than a 2 minute walk from the beach. Definitely a must try when you are here!",

My 1 year old and 3 year old shared the chicken strips and ate almost all of it! That s how much they loved it! Everything is freshly cooked and so tasty! The owner checked on us and made sure everything was to our liking! I definitely recommend stopping here!! It is also perfect walking distance to the beach!",

Thickly crispy on the outside, soft in the middle. Dressed in a truffle parmesan sauce. This was close to the best fries/chips Ive ever had, and Im a connoisseur. Even the salad is worth mentioning as it had a tasty dressing with crispy (fried garlic?) topping. Only complaint is the price. $19 for the steak sando.",

The chicken fingers, you have to get them hot and fresh right away, are literally the best in the world. No seriously, they are simply incredible. Delicately juicy but with the perfect thin crunch, unbelievable. For fries go with the truffle fries, bomb, they also make for great munchie chips for later. (They keep in the fridge overnight, which is not possible to say about regular french fries). I still need to try the cheesesteaks etc., but i wont be able to resist the chicken fingers again next time i order out, i cook a lot at home and know my spots, this is one of a very select few that are at the top of the list. Order up the whole menu, and enjoy.",

We went close to the closing time, and the restaurant was packed but he made sure we had our food before they close for the night. Vonns serve undoubtedly the most flavorful items. We tried the double patty beef burger and the Vonns special cheesesteak. The patties of the burger were juicy enough, and cooked to the perfection. The bun was soft but not soggy. The fries complimented the burger and made the meal wholesome. The cheesesteak was equally delicious. Will we visit this restaurant again? Of course, whenever we have the cravings for burger, this will be our place to go.",

One of the greatest hospitalities I have ever seen! I think it was the owner himself going around, welcoming and talking about the specials to every guests on every table. When he heard that it was our first time dining in at Vonns, he suggested that we dont take combos with each meal but get one dish to share and when we chose truffle fries, he said they will ne on the house! He made sure to take our feedback after we finished eating (we couldnt exactly finish those large portions, so we had to pack up the leftovers!). My steak was medium instead of the rare medium that it was supposed to be (it still tasted great!). The man apologized profusely for this tiny mistake and did not charge me for my entire meal and made me promise that I visit a second time for the perfect buttery medium rare steak. I never messaged because it felt like ripping off a small business. But when I posted a review on Facebook, they messaged me themselves with the voucher for free meals for 2. They really make you feel special! Thank you Vonns for making our first visit (potentially of many) an excellent experience! They deserve more than 5/5! P.S. their new XD burger is totally worth the hype!",

The food was as usual delicious and the final twist of the evening was the owner refused to take the payment and even declined to allow me to pay the tips .

We also tried Birria Tacos which had super soft beef and flavorful broth. Excellent food. Service is exceptional! We would love to visit this place in the future.",

We ordered the new launched steak. Its called steak frites. Its not on the menu yet, it was super yummy! I would recommend it anytime. They normally make the steak medium, then u can have it with fries or the potato slices thing, forgot what its called, and it comes with sauces its so good. The steak was so soft and tender. Its halaal too, for those who need to know...It was delicious, it comes with ketchup and chipotle sauce and garlic sauce. Parking is on the street, so stones becomes difficult to find. Staff are very friendly. The meat runs out, so call in before you come to check if they are open and still have their meat. I would recommend it anytime and would go again anytime!",

I really enjoyed the outside patio and loved how there were open-sinks (so that you wouldn t have to open doors) and how the kitchen was so open and you could see how clean it was. Plus, what was something that was really interesting to me was that you could pay after your meal. ****A very special feature for me was that all the food served at this restaurant was halal.**** The staff recommended the double cheeseburger combo (fries and soda can extra 4$) and it s absolutely delicious. Overall this place was in a very nice location with a nice theme and I recommend this nice restaurant to everybody",
