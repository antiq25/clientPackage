The rolls were GREAT sized; in fact perfect. My first bite I actually had an explosion of each independent flavour coming together. It was like in FOOD WARS when the song comes on and someone has a FOODGASM. Both rolls were BOMB BOMB BOMB; so I proceeded to order a SAKE in-line , alongside a Chicken Curry Katsu. Providing a detailed video of each dish; photos of the menu for you to enjoy and the SAKE/Atmosphere. Giving the atmosphere a 5/5 because of the music.  Don t miss out on this friends =).

There is a peaceful ambiance in here and the servers are lovely. Food is served right on time and what surprised me is the huge portions they serve compared to other places The prices are reasonable in regards to the food. I will be eating every time I am DT.

The mix between the rice, the egg poured on top of that burning hot ingredients and the meat is just tasteful. As a courtesy, they will serve you miso soup, which has very good, just missed the pieces of Tofu, as we usually have it served at the Japanese Restaurants in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Highly recommend when in Vancouver.",

From the moment you enter theres a welcoming atmosphere, and youll have plenty of jasmine tea to drink while you try to figure out an achievable number of dishes to pick off the menu. You cant go wrong with any of the don options--katsudon and chirashizushi featured this time, but each item comes with plenty of toppings and cooked-just-right rice. A hanabi sushi roll and corokke (sweet potato croquette) rounded out the meal. Everything tasted great, and the seafood selection was plenty fresh. Be prepared to make some hard decisions on which combination calls to you--our server was happy to make a few recommendations and quick to bring them out once confirmed. Prices were really good, too; less than I would have expected for the quality of food and experience.",
