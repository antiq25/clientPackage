Tried Luca for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner and loved all their meal options. I tried their Koshari, Okra stew and Lamb shanks as well and were all great (only if the onion rings for Koshari were a bit more crispy) but nevetheless it is soooo delicious and very very reasonably priced The service is excellent no debate, highly recommend One final thing... the tea with mint is just perfect :) Vegetarian options: Kushary and the breakfast of course",

We ordered the linguini bolognese and Egyptian lamb curry with rice (I think the curry is a special for the weekends). Both had amazing flavors and were so fresh! I love pasta so I was so excited to try this dish. This is my kind of comfort food. Prices are really reasonable too! Cant wait to come back and try some more dishes, especially the koshari!!",

Location is great, indoor and outdoor seating areas, vibes of place are encouraging to go there more and more. They serve most of the authentic Egyptian food that you can t resist. Egyptian breakfast that is served every Saturday and Sunday were amazing including fava beans, falafel and others. The most famous Egyptian dish ( Koshari) that can be eaten any time of the day were done so professionally. Staff are friendly, helpful and available for any request. Food, vibes and service are so perfect that for sure will go there again. Dietary restrictions: Just inform them and they will be sure to follow all diet restrictions. Parking: Street parking is easily available and it s only $1.5. Kid-friendliness: Very nice dishes for kids from all ages Wheelchair accessibility: It s wheelchair accessible.",

They have started to serve breakfast on the weekends as well. I want to come back to try that. Great atmosphere and the prices are very good compared to other places where you nowhere near get the same quality and service. Everything is halal on the menu too.",

If you like middle eastern flavors with a pinch of traditional Egyptian feel, then this place is your utopia. Food is so good that you wont believe yourself. What makes the experience even better is that owners, who work themselves, welcome you as if youre a life long friend! If you ever been to Egypt, youd know that level of hospitality and warmth in greeting and welcoming you! You feel like you dont want to leave this place because you feel so good between the food and the whole environment. I highly recommend! BUT be warned the experience may cause you to be addicted",

The meat is very tender and the soup had a very pleasant flavor . Mombar has a very unique flavor that i have never tasted from any middle east restaurant. I recommend to eat the mombar with the lamb curry. Koshary was 10/10 SO GOOD  everyone who is new to egyptian food must try the koshary and the lamb curry. Don t forget to try the falafel. Only this restaurant make it differently as it is authentic Egyptian. The service is wonderful. Staff and chef gave an excellent service and are friendly. I will definitely come back for more Vegetarian options: Falafel",

The service was great and the chef even came out to ask everyone who was eating if they enjoyed the food. The dish itself was very flavorful and reminded me of a Spicy Arrabiata Pasta but with more flavor depth and lots of different types of Carbs to soak up the juices. You have Macaroni, Vermicelli, Lentils and Chick Peas, plus Fried Shallots, mixed with a Fiery Tomato Sauce Broth, but even though the dish is spicy, the Carb elements soften the flavor up, allowing you to take in all the different layers of flavor. Also, not pictured, is a fantastic Rice Pudding that was very thick and creamy.",

The size and filling as well as the shrimp   size is so generous! Would highly recommend giving it a try! Also, know that they have a special brunch on weekends and special Egyptian dishes on Fridays :) Lastly,  the mint tea is my best thing to have there after finishing my food!

The serving size, the sauce, the pasta texture, presentation and all we would definitely be back here!

The linguine were cooked perfectly in all of them and our favourite was the shrimp pasta. It was creamy and flavourful. We also got chicken tacos and if you like soft shell tacos, then it s a must try! The service was wonderful. The chef took his time to greet the tables and offered us a rice pudding on the house. A great addition to cleanse our palates. The rice pudding was rich and creamy and lightly sweetened. Would recommend going there! All the best, Team Luca!",
