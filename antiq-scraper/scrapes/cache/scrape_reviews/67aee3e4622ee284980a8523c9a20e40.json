The grab and go sandwiches are tasty and I can t get enough of their delicious cookies. I also happened to have attended an event recently and was pleasantly surprised to have found Peqish catered it. Their spread looked wonderful. Will for sure keep them in mind if I need catering in the future.",

The sandwiches Ive had seem like the bread is stale. Wraps are good, but could have more in them. Boxed salads are okay. Seared salmon / chicken is my favourite go-to there. Comes with quinoa and a tasty dressing. Actually went in today at ten minutes to 12 to get a lunch. There was already someone waiting at the till when I entered. After looking around, I chose what I wanted and went to the till as well. Nobody was there to serve us!  Several staff were in the back cooking and prepping things, but they didnt acknowledge us or come to the front to man the till. I was in a rush, so I just put the food back and left. Not sure when Ill be returning since there are a lot of other choices around. Peqishs main business is catering, and that fact certainly showed today. When the staff are there at the front, they are nice and friendly.",

Today I got a Festive Chicken Crancherry sandwich, which once again only tasted of onion. Even on the list of ingredients it mentioned a touch of aioli, but didnt mention the many chunks of raw red onion that appeared in the sandwich. Hope that doesnt mess up people with allergies... Very not impressed. Want a nice sandwich made with local ingredients but want to be able to taste the ingredients I purchased the sandwich for, not the ones not even mentioned on the ingredients list.",

Also, theres barely anything inside (equivalent amount of fish that may be on one piece of nigiri sushi for example, thats it for inside the whole sandwich, meat/fish almost non-existent), just mostly the bread, mayo and some lettuce. It looked questionable, but was hopeful there was more to it than met the eye. After a couple bites I realized it was a let down. Not even worth half the price. I showed the staff, only a couple bites in, and explained my dissatisfaction, and no refund was offered.... Update, to address the response from Peqish: I am not interested in ever eating here again, not even for free.",
