The lobster roll was honestly my favorite thing about attending Canucks  games.  The lobster roll tasted good.  The lobster meat was cooked well and the texture perfect.  I admit it s been a few years since I had season tickets.  I renewed this year and told everyone the lobster roll was a can t miss.  The lobster roll held it s own but the new kettle chips are a miss.   Bring back Ms Vickies!  The kettle chips were hard and tasteless.",
