            "review_text": "So good. We went there for the first time tonight for dinner. My husband and I were already talking about what to order on our next visit as soon as we got into our car after the meal. There were 5 of us tonight and we had: 1. Deep fried meat dumplings - meaty fillings in crispy wrappings. 2. Seafood and green onion pancakes - it was the best Korean seafood pancake we ve had in Vancouver. The dough was light but it was filled with seafood goodness. The outside was perfectly fried with crunchy and crispy edges. 3. Beef short ribs in sweet soy sauce - The flavour of the dish rendered it as my mom s favourite. The meat was tender and charred to perfection. 4. Plain pork belly - This was my favourite. All the pieces were also charred nicely and they were heavenly with the accompanying dipping condiment (salt and spices in oil). Service was excellent. The staff were friendly and attentive. I love this place.",

I have had seafood pancake at other restaurants and it has been uncooked or too much dough. This was the perfect green onion seafood pancake, the dough was soooo crunchy and the fillings so fresh, HUGE portion and the hot plate it comes on keeps it hot for the entire meal. I ate the leftovers cold the next day and it was great that way as well .Our server was kind and helpful , I will for sure be back 5/5!",

I ve had numerous occasions with colleagues, friends, and family, and we cannot be more satisfied with every time&penny we spent at Yook! Ingredients are fresh, tasty, and mouthwatering regardless of what we ordered. Their signature grilled plates were just top-notch! Of course,  we all know well friendly K-dish  available as well. Not just the food, their staffs were always constant and friendly as well. It might be little be further from Skytrain station (Broadway/Commercial, 5-10min walking distance), but the atmosphere is clean and fresh with tons of seats for groups as well, definitely worth the visit!

The chicken couldve been spicier, but there were crispy bits that added good texture and flavour was on point, being one of those sweeter marinades.

I like that there s no BBQ on the tables because I hate smelling after a meal. You can still order BBQ things like LA Galbi without needing to cook it yourself.

The variety of vegetables is great, and they are always cooked well and the food comes fast. The chicken is never dry or tough, always moist, very delicious seasoning, and a nice belly-warming spice level. Sometimes with my takeout orders they also give me the 3 little starting appetizer plates that they give with eat in meals that include what I believe are fish cakes, marinated veggies, and one more small dish that I cant remember at the moment. I really appreciate getting these yummy extras, and they make the meal that much more special and add so much value! I always know Ill be satisfied with a meal from Yook and at a fantastic price. The service is always super friendly as well! A really great gem in Vancouver.",

It was spicy and sweet at the same time.  And the chef maintained the texture very well.   Well balanced dish.  We also ordered the seafood soup.  They gave very generous portion of tofu.  A hearty dish.  Ambience is great.",

Fairly new establishment, only open around 2 years. Hearty food with huge portions (one dish easily feeds 2) - the meats were exceptional. Perfectly marinated and grilled so you could still enjoy the juicy tenderness of the bulgogi. The kimchi was so fresh, you could still taste the crunch of the cabbage - none of that wilted, overly salty stuff here. The spicy chicken on a cast iron hot plate was the highlight. It came with chewy rice cakes, nicely caramelized by the hot pot, in a sweaty spicy sauce! Im salivating right now just thinking about it. Super yummy! The service was prompt, pleasant and speedy. Some parking available behind the restaurant. I will definitely be becoming a regular. This place is truly deserving of 5-stars.... awesome!",

The food is always on point and fairly priced for the amount you get especially if you are sharing with others. The service, music, and atmosphere is great. My only complaint is they need some more variety with their beer and shouldn t charge so much for it. They raised the price of a small can of P49 Lager to $8! We got take-out the other day due to covid and bought some beer next door. What a difference to have an actual tasty beer with some spicy dakgalbi. Regardless, I m looking forward to being able to sit down at Yook again to enjoy some delicious eats.",

It is pretty well priced for Korean food in vancouver. Wish it closed a bit later though as my friends and I like to go for late meals and few drinks sometimes. The workers here are pleasant and welcoming. I also recommend this place to my friends and colleagues when they ask me where do I go for some good Korean food.
