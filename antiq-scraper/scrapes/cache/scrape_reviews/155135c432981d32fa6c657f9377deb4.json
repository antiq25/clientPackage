            "review_text": "I ve used Limor s services a few times now, and I m fully satisfied each and every time. Her team is courteous, professional, and so very efficient. (Packed a 2700-sq feet, 4-person house in 3-4 hours!)  For this most recent move, we also used their unpacking service, and man was I impressed!  The team was very thoughtful in where they put things and asked questions when they thought I may have a preference (since kitchen placement is so personal!). I especially appreciated how they removed all the boxes (from BBX moving), cardboard, and paper and put them in the carport, so the house felt ready to live in when they were done. So amazing!  (BBX Moving came and removed ALL the boxes and cardboard and trash the next day). Limor herself is always responsive, patient, and extremely pleasant to deal with. In the few times that I ve worked with her, I  always get a sense that she works very hard, takes pride in her work, and has a very strong work ethic. All in all, I would not hesitate to recommend them. Worth every penny!!",

            "review_text": "Vancouver In The Box gave highly professional, exceptional work from start to finish. Limor and her team are amazing at what they do, and they provide courteous, caring service throughout. They come in with a plan, they hussle, and they get it done right! You won t go wrong in hiring them. We began with an on-site consultation where Limor walked through the house, took notes, asked questions about priorities, and provided suggestions on how to proceed. We decided to utilize her team for packing as well as some unpacking services. I am so very glad we did. It was critically important for us that we minimize the chaos of the move for Dad. He has memory issues that make any change to his environment frustrating and confusing for him. Limor proposed that we split packing across two days and leave the key pieces like Dad s bedroom and his tv room for the last moment. Also, they photographed Dad s space and when unpacking they essentially recreated it in our new place so that he immediately felt at home. It was brilliant! I wish I had taken photos of the boxes they packed so you could see the attention to detail in their work. We did not lose a single piece to breakage, and we had around 200 boxes of goods being moved. Everything was labelled and colour coded. And their art inventory service is such a great idea, I highly recommend taking advantage of that too. I m not going to tell you it was cheap because frankly it wasn t. But let s get real here: we hired trained professionals to provide a skilled service that supported our move and made our lives so much easier. I can tell you with absolute conviction that it was money very well spent, and we received excellent value for our investment.",

They helped me figuring out my new place storage cupboards in kitchen, washroom and closets. This took away so much stress I had around the move. My new place was all unpacked and ready within two hours. No cardboard boxes to recycle, no tape, wrapping paper. All was taken care of as they bring their own plastic containers which were picked up right away. Stress free worth gold decision. So glad I worked with this company. I wouldn t do it any way in the future. Highly recommend Limor and her team. They were amazing.",

For her its about setting the customer up for success instead of just providing a service.

They were able to provide a quote through a video conference. Once the team arrived they documented the location of every item to make sure that once the reno was done they could unpack in the same location every item. They professionally packed every item and coordinated the storage. I will not hesitate to use Vancouver in the box services again!!",

They required nothing from me except for a quick walk through before they began (to make sure they knew where everything was and mark items that I didnt want them to pack) and after they were done (to make sure everything I wanted to be packed was packed). They were extremely nice and polite, and not only did they do an amazing job, but they also did it so quietly that I was actually able to work the entire time they were there. All of the boxes were labeled, so we knew whats where, and because they knew we would be moving the boxes ourselves, they made sure to pack in a way so no box was overly heavy. Moving is a tiring and stressful experience. Especially for people who work full time and dont have the luxury of taking their time. Do yourself a favour and let Limor and her staff take care of the packing for you. You will not regret it. I know we definitely will next time we move too!",

The only negatives I have are that I feel the price was slightly high for the amount of stuff I had and I had a nice suit that was crudely jammed into the bottom of a box. Everything else was packed extremely well however so the suit was the exception not the rule. Update: They were very apologetic re: the suit and refunded me $40 to have it professionally pressed.",

            "review_text": "Vancouver In The Box is A...MAZE...ING!  We were moving from a townhouse in downtown Vancouver to an apartment nearby with absolutely no time to do anything other than call someone.  We did our homework and lined up three moving companies to come in, take a look, and provide estimates including packing and unpacking.  Vancouver In The Box wasn t the cheapest, but they were the only ones that we had full confidence in and in the end it was obvious exactly where the extra money was going - it was worth every penny.  Theresa in particular was simply the most professional and impressive person we have ever worked with in all of our lives.  We threw her quite a few curve balls and she hit all of them out of the park with ease.  Moving is usually very stressful, and it was so nice to have someone constantly stepping up and saying  I ve got this.   We re now recommending them to everyone we meet, and that includes you.  Do yourself a favor and choose this company for your next move :)",

I was so stressed out before my move and i was never going to be able to do everything on my own before the moving date. I emailed V in the B two days before I asked them to come and I was spazzing out stressed out of my mind. Their email response (10 minutes after my initial email) calmed me down immediately and they came two days later. Now listen to this. They packed my whole 1500 sqft townhouse that was completely full including a garage completely full of stuff (borderline hoarder status) ALL BEFORE LUNCH TIME!!  Seriously started at 9 we re done by 12. 70 Boxes completely full and all of my art preoffesionaly packed. Everything professionally packed wrapped in paper. Nothing was broken or damaged. Absolutely top notch awesome work!! Would recommend to anyone and would totally use them again!!",
