No, they totally lived up to their reviews, from the service all the way to the food they are in every way the best in town. I ve got the truffle mushroom burger recommend by the staff with a half poutine, the burger is rich and flavourful, everything works really well together. Poutine is beautifully done, and their gravy is exceptionally rich. You just have to try it to believe it.",

            "review_text": "Long story short: definitely give this place a try. Place has 4.9 for a reason! It was a cold dark rainy night (seriously, sept 24, 8pm, it was raining). My partner and I were standing outside the omelettery, puzzled by the burger sign, as we tried to open up the qr code menu on our phones. The owner, Sina, flung open the front door and welcomed us to look at the menu inside. He then took us on a journey on how his burger ingredients were sourced, prepared and served. All of which, was brimming with excitement and passion. You could really tell Sina was really proud of what he and his team were slinging. His pitch made us forget we were walking over from having dessert. We had to try one, even though we were full. We got the juicy original burger, and we enjoyed it next to our car, under the lights of a carpet store. So I cant say for sure how well it holds up for delivery or long transport. The beef: smash-seared perfectly. Not too thin that you get jerky. Smashed enough so you get a crisp meaty crust but the center is still juicy. The bun: airy, light, not soggy or falling aparty. The caramelized onions: slowly cooked to a perfect unrushed jammy perfection. Will definitely be back to try the other more hefty burgers!",

It was genuinely the best I ve ever had and I ve had my fair share of burgers across the country. We re traveling from out of province and looking for something to eat. I have to say one of the best foods I ve had throughout our entire trip to Vancouver. The buns were so soft and the patty tasted extremely delicious and slightly crispy which was perfect. The flavours were incredible. I got the Pineapple Express burger and my friend got the regular cheese burger and both were crazy good. I was tempted to buy another. Enough that we went back and tried their poutine. I really liked it. I love how they added onions to top it off. The gravy flavour is great. I would definitely get their burgers again if we ever come back to Vancouver. Also thanks for the free cookies    Hopefully one day they come have a restaurant in our city",

If youre ordering in person, it feels a bit like youre at a burger speakeasy. I had the pineapple express. A generous amount of delicious beef meat with a bit of rib eye in there, whiskey BBQ sauce, pineapple, tomato, crispy onion bits... Finger-licking good. The picture doesnt do justice to it. Know that the burgers do not come with fries, but I was clearly there for the burgs and honestly it felt like a satisfying meal in itself. Staff was awesome, passionned about their burgers, talking about them. The hype was real and I wasnt disappointed. Got a glass of water and sat until my burger was ready, got a free cookie as it was my 1st time. Seriously go try their burgers.",

Starting with the packaging, box container to prevent smushing and foil to retain heat. Bun was buttery and fragrant but not overly sweet. The cheese was still melted and needed no reheating. My usual gripe with smash patties is that I seem to get less meat than I would a usual burger, not so with Joes.  The patties were stacked high and each one was super crispy.

Everyone working there is super friendly too - I called in a takeout order last night and it was going to be ready before I could get there, so they delayed it for me so it would be fresher without any problem. It is takeout only (operating from the omelleterie, which closes before they open), so I recommend people plan on eating in the park nearby or driving it right home. The food keeps in the takeout bag reasonably well (fries still crispy, burger hot and juicy with no runoff) but like any food the faster you can eat it after cooking the better it tastes! Ive been mentioning to people that I have a new secret burger place and then showing them it on the map. Its a good conversation starter, though the 500 reviews here seem to point to my secret getting out...",

While searching, we found this place on google and had really great reviews so we decided to give it a try! We couldn t find it at first but after driving around where it was supposed to be, we found it. They only do take out as they don t have their own place yet. The customer service was amazing, the owner was there and he chatted with us while we were waiting for our food and gave us great recommendations. All the food on the menu was carefully thought out and some of the ingredients were highly sourced out as well. The workers there had really great knowledge of the menu as well and recommended us on what their favourite things were on the menu and I m so glad we listened to them. We ordered the yam fries and they were really good, the house mayo was the best as it was super creamy! For our mains we ordered the truffle mushroom burger and the mushroom blue and I only have great things to say, the mushroom blue is by far the BEST burger I ve ever had and the truffle burger comes second! We also ordered cookies and they gave it to us on the house and that was a really nice touch! If you ever come to Vancouver, you guys need to try this place out, you won t regret it! We will definitely come back when we re in van city and hopefully they have their own restaurant by then! :)",

But thats not where it ends, because the fries step up and demonstrate that they are not here to play 2nd fiddle to those burgers. Crispy on the outside but still a nice interior consistency. With a light seasoning they have a lovely flavour on their own, but when combined with the roasted garlic dip? Amazing. Its a little bit hard to find, until you realize it is actually run out of the same location as the Omelettery. This is a great small business. They are open late, have super friendly staff, and great food! Whats not to love? (No photos, I didnt want to waste a second by grabbing my phone instead of the food.)",

Like stupid good. I found out about them a week ago, I ve already been 4 times. I must be stopped. But I can t because these burgers insane. Get the Bacon one it s my favorite.

Let me start off by saying the food is 10/10 and I have NEVER had a smash burger as tasty as Juicy Joes! I have lived in California and have been all over USA and tried several different burgers but these guys nailed the recipe. The burger and it s ingredients are completely fresh and it literally melts in your mouth when you take a bite. The onions are caramelized to perfection, the meat is exceptional quality, with a crunchy and golden brown texture, and the American cheese + bun is to die for. Literally the best Ive had in my entire life. The owner Cena is a charismatic and very passionate man whose hospitality is very welcoming. He is a very kind man who is always smiling and going above and beyond with his service. All the chefs and employees and extremely hard working with the best energy ALWAYS. Do not miss this hidden gem, it deserves all the flowers, reviews, and appreciation. I eat here a few times every week and cannot get enough! JUICY JOES FOR THE WIN",

This was the best service experience I ve ever had at a restaurant by far. The guy at the front was kind, funny, and had a great energy. I ordered a full poutine and a jr cheeseburger for about $28CAD, but also got a free cookie, side of fries, and orange juice. The cheeseburger is easily the most flavorful burger I ve had, especially given its simplicity. their poutine is also great. the fries were crispy and fluffy, the cheese was melty, and the gravy was warm and delicious. I can t recommend this place enough, it s worlds better than your favorite chain burger restaurant!",

It wasn t like I was having a bad day when I happened to happen upon the hallowed halls of Joe s storied kitchen, I was just feeling generally kind of listless in life. Which is arguably worse. However, as I m sure you ve already guessed, my dear, hungry, hamburger loving reader, all of my malaise and ennui melted away as soon as Juicy Joe s delightfully classic cheeseburger entered my universe. The carefully selected, locally sourced ingredients, the meticulous manner in which each culinary element worked in concert to create a definitively delectable and singularly scrumptious consumption experience, and ultimately the marvellous man behind the magical sandwich all helped to remind me that there are so many things to live for. To live is to aspire to lofty goals and then pursue them with as much tenacity as kindness. With as much fierce perseverance as brotherly understanding. With all your mind and all your heart. Juicy Joe s serves up more than just tasty burgers. Juicy Joe s will reinvigorate your passion to dream, to attain, and to live. Thanks for the burger Juicy Joe s! You changed my life, and I will be forever grateful.",

I recently had the pleasure of trying their smashburgers, and they were hands-down the best burgers Ive ever had. The patties were perfectly seared, juicy, and bursting with flavor. I also couldnt get enough of their crispy and savory poutine, complete with vegan gravy options that were just as delicious. The service was top-notch, and the atmosphere was casual and inviting, making it the perfect spot for a quick lunch or casual dinner. Its no surprise that Juicy Joes has a 4.9-star rating on Google - they truly deserve it. If youre a burger fan, dont miss out on Juicy Joes. Its a must-visit for anyone looking for the ultimate burger experience.",
