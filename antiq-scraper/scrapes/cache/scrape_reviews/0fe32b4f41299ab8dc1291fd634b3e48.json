The first thing that I ve notice was that the heat inside was way to too high for a sunny autumn day.  My server brought me water and gave me the menu, it was quite confusing about the quantity of food per order, as well as the happy hour menu. I did ordered a Birria taco and a beer, they were run out of some of the beer in menu so I decided for a lager. When My order came, the taco was looking delicious, and it was indeed. However, I guess 14 dollars for 1 taco was way too expensive, It might be due to inflation, but just felt kinda scammed. It was good on size and filling, but was just not enough. After that I ordered a margarita of coconut and ginger. The was actually really tasty, was impressed tho. Taste like nieve de garrafa with a fresh and creamy twist. In general, i think the taste is really nice and authentic, it is a bit pricey for the portions that you get nevetherless.",
