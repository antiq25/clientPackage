            "review_text": "Allegro is a very cool coffee shop because its perched above Whole Foods Market.  You can have a coffee and get a birds-eye view of the store, or watch out the window at the traffic on Cambie Street.  Theres a nice selection of food in the coffee shop and you can get a much wider selection of ready to eat food in Whole Foods Market.  The coffee is good, the staff are great, service is fast.  They do a lot of recycling in the coffee shop and the Market.  WiFi is good.  Bathroom is good.  The only problem is that (at the moment) the coffee shop closes at 2PM.  But there is cafe seating in the Market below.  Which is nice.  I only like to review places I like and this definitely one of them.  Its got a good vibe.  And I like to shop at Whole Foods Market, so its win win. Vegetarian options: Theres a lot in the deli below at the market.",

They have a wide variety of muffins to choose from, and they even heat them up for you. The cafe offers different types of, and the best part is that they provide milk alternatives without any extra charges. The cozy atmosphere adds to the overall experience, and the staff is always incredibly friendly. Highly recommended! Vegetarian options: Vegan muffin for the win",
