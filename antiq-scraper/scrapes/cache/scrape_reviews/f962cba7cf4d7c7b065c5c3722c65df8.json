But since I moved to Vancouver closer to this location on Victoria Drive i do find this branch overall still really good and helpful! I felt bad for staff when all of vancitys systems were shut down! Few days or week?  The staff were still happy helpful and ready to help even with coffee, Halloween candy, smiles, and quick service to all of us cranky customers with the same repeated questions! Thanks you guys! I have been using vancity since before 10 years old! Still my number one banking choice and my only choice! :)",

Anyway, I would have given the review couple more stars if it wasn t for the inconvenience. It was Sunday morning and I was going to use the ATM but before I open the door I notice a homeless person sleeping on the ground near the ATM machines. This is a young guy in his 20s or 30s. As you can see in my picture attached you can see some sleeping on the ground. As a result I didn t even bother going in as I had a separate similar experience at another location. I am not discriminating homeless people but they shouldn t sleep inside the financial institution. It just make some people feel uncomfortable doing banking. I wish Vancity would do something about it.",

I had to reset my phone so I lost access to Authenticator app. I tried to login but it keeps me asking for code that I dont have access without giving me any options to use my phone code or whatever. I call, but they were all busy, I chose the option to call back. After 2h without getting the call back, I decide to drive to the closest branch (Victoria & 41). I explain my situation to the guy there, telling that I lost access to my MFA, they give me a receipt with a new password. I go home, resetted my password and then what?? MFA still there!!! Useless!!! I have lost all morning just to login to my account! and still dont have access!",

Nowadays even the big bank local branches are now open Monday to Saturday! Also want to add that I ve been a member over 40 years and that I do most banking online.  Having to walk over to find a closed branch on Monday when I definitely needed to do a face to face meeting is very frustrating.  Sure there are other Vancity branches open, but now I need to drive my gasoline powered car to another branch further away is definitely not good to the environment! Please don t make lame excuses and respond directly to why the Victoria Drive branch cannot open Monday to Saturday just like other financial institutions nearby?",
