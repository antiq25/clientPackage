            "review_text": "My partner suggested this spot after reading some reviews online, it s a small family friendly joint! The restaurant gets quite busy during lunch, I would suggest plan accordingly and come after the lunch rush. The restaurant holds about 20 people or less, the ambiance is that of a fish spot with seafood art on the walls. Since this was our first stop in Granville Island and wanted to try and see everything, we decided to share the clam chowder and the infamous fish and Chips! Great customer service, daughter was our server, mother washing dishes very humble people. If you are in a hurry, I wouldn t suggest coming here, everything is made fresh to order so it ll take a min. The food was hot and absolutely delicious, one of the best fish and chips around!",

The halibut fish and chips tasted alright still bit dry which isnt what I like but their cod is the best cod i have ever eaten! Not dry, the right type of moist and soft which didnt need much of tarter sauce because it was perfect just the way it was! I went there with my family and we shared every plate together so ordering the seafood special and oysters were the best and is easy to divide up! Best service! The waitresses and waiters were nice. The place seems to get really busy easily so be sure to sprint there to get a good spot (especially if you have a big group) and this is the best place for families to have a get together! Very family friendly place and comfy.",

Also really loved the fries!  Great value.. two of us shared this plate and were both full.  Will definitely come back and try the rest of the menu.",

Come a little early or past the peak and youll be fine. The clam chowder was among the best Ive had, fish and chips, and halibut - along with a native Granville brewed ale - it was just perfect. Such friendly staff - the lady who served us went above and beyond, voluntarily splitting a family style order to make it easy for us to enjoy! She has been with Tonys for 12 years over three ownerships - now that means a lot! On Granville Island - youve got to treat yourself to wholesome food and good old Canadian hospitality!",

I came during a quieter time, still pretty full, but no wait! I was debating between the cod or the salmon fish and chips.  Waitress said I could have both, great!  Wait time was not long, under 10 minutes.  Good looking, fair sized portions, ( I got the 2 piece ).  Salmon was good, Cod light and flakey, both battered to a light crisp perfection.  Fries were good, well done in house.  Delicious coleslaw, not too creamy which I found perfect.  Tartar is tasty, you can tell its made in house. All in all, good tasty eats that wont blow your mind, but are what you are hoping for from fish and chips.  Service was friendly and helpful.  Price was around $19.00 for the 2 piece fish and chips. Would come back if Im ever in the area again!",

They have the local Granville Island Ale/Lager on tap, no doubt from the brewery right across the street-- the ale was well-balanced: not too hoppy, not too malty, and a great complement to the fish and chips. If you get anything here, get the seafood platter, which is a little of everything plus some garlic butter sauce. I dont know if the chef went to the nearby culinary school, but if she did, it certainly shows. The food was fantastic: perfectly seasoned, neither over- nor under-done. It is a bit cramped, having 6 or 7 small tables plus a bar in a space where I would use 4 tables, but the food and excellent service are well worth it.",
