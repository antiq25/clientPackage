A bar, taco bar, and serving mostly Mexican food but with a modern twist...Happy Hour during the week and all day Sunday, great prices,  the food is served up quick from the kitchen & is tasty. My only complaint is there needs to be more servers for when it gets really busy to alleviate a long wait for service ( plus the servers are run off their feet). Like a vacation on Main Street!

A little confession to make: on more than one occasion (okay, most times) Ive had the beef birria tacos. The BEST! Im quite possibly addicted. The guacamole is very good too, as is the carne asada burrito, and Ive mooched poutine from my wifes plate which was a reasonable interpretation of roadside patate frite trucks in Quebec. Good fries, gravy was rich but not overly so and of course cheese curds were fresh and just the right texture. The wait staff and bar staff at Alphabet City are consistently attentive and enthusiastic and the kitchen staff do an astounding job. While its true the new owners have had some staffing challenges, its safe to ignore the dubious negative reviews posted by disgruntled former staff.",
