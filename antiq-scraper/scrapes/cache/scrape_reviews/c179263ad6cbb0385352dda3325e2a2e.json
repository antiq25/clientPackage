After sitting there chatting for 20 minutes while I waited in their view, 3 of them, I was finally served by an arrogant condescending man who treated me like I was in the wrong for finally saying excuse me. I could hear what you re talking about, it was not work related, sir. However, my attendance to your location is, do your job! He then proceeded to give me vague answers and sigh repeatedly as I asked the difference between medications so I could choose one to purchase. The judgemental arrogant attitude I received, coupled with the fact he told me I couldn t get my inhaler filled until the next day (it was only 4pm) even tho I told him I was short of breath and it s just ventolin that I ALREADY HAVE A REFILL ON FILE FOR, leads me to give them a 1/10. I have several other negative experiences too this is not a one off. This is a terrible pharmacy who doesn t care about their patients health, just about their profits.",

They even claimed it on my insurance which was fully covered. I had to commute back to the pharmacy again.

They said they told me it was law to bring it in when they left me the ready for pickup voicemail, but thats not true. If they had I would have brought it in. Also, my doctor wrote x3 for refills but they disregarded it and put 0 refills because it wasnt in the form at the top.  I DID get ruder than I should have, but late in the evening, grocery shopping before bed, didnt expect to be treated so badly and have to worry about leaving without my meds. They eventually gave me my prescription but made it clear they thought I was lying. It was a basic prescription for a daily med I need to survive... nothing illicit and certainly not worth them being jerks over.
