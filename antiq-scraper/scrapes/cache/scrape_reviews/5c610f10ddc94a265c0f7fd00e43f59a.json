            "review_text": "We didnt even notice how Rodneys Gastown location turned in one of our favorites in town. Before, we mainly went to Fanny Bay to feed the craving for oysters but decided to try Rodneys one day, and theres no coming back. Upon our first arrival, the place was bustling, and we were seated at the bar, which was something new for us at an oyster joint. Jumping ahead, I can tell that the bar seating is the only one we accept visiting Rodneys since then. At first, I was a bit irritated with the service but turned out we came there right at the change of shifts, and everything was fixed pretty quickly. Ive heard from many people that they dont like the atmosphere here because the staff reminds them of a fraternity. I have to disagree with that. I think that the mood created by the team with their witty behavior and high energy creates one of a kind experience no one else can offer. Thats why seating at the bar is the best spot available if you ask me. After all, I dont find oysters to be fancy food like many dining places trying to make it, so I think that a more straightforward and friendlier atmosphere suits it much better. The variety of oysters is pretty amazing, and its always the freshest and best product out there. And its hard to beat their Low Tide deals for oysters and drinks. I encourage people to try Rodneys because this place is absolutely spectacular.",

Its a lively, noisy restaurant, but we didnt have trouble hearing each other over the music and other customers. It is a relatively small restaurant, so reservations are probably a good idea. We sat at the bar without a reservation on a Saturday afternoon, but even that filled up quickly while we were there.",

The kitchen was missing a cook, orders were backed-up and hot food took longer to come out. However, our server Fox, and Manager Lou  came by and made sure were were kept informed, and made us feel so well taken care of we did not mind the wait. They knew how to recover the situation and turned what could have been a long wait into a very positive experience. They were fun, positive, and very professional. And when we did get our pan fried oysters, they were more than worth the wait! Chef came by and we had nothing but compliments for him. A most pleasant experience, will be back next time we are in Vancouver!",

We had to wait 45 minutes for a table, but just got a drink somewhere else in Gastown for that time and they called us, so good location generally for before/after drinks as well. We were able to find parking relatively easily less than 2 minutes away and it was also inexpensive. Would return!",

Pan-fried oysters are very good and the selection of raw oysters is quite good. 80s music played throughout 90% chance the servers and you will have a good time when in the air tonight by Phil Collins comes on. Definitely recommend coming out here.",
