They have a keen interest in what each subconsultant involved has to offer, to gain an even more thorough knowledge of the different pieces that make up the puzzle - this is only part of what makes their project management stand out. They have an inclusive project team mentality, making sure all aspects are covered and comments heard, while still being efficient.",

Thank you for your help Hedgehog. I look forward to working with you more as the need arises.",

            "review_text": "I had the opportunity to see Hedgehog Technologies from the inside as part of a six-week management project. I have seen the inner workings of a lot of consulting companies, and HHT is genuinely in a league of its own. It all comes down to excellence, inclusiveness, and fun. First, excellence. This is a company that seeks out unique, challenging work that most other EE companies can t handle. This is a sharp, elite team that is brought in on complex projects where human lives are at risk and safety is paramount. This can be seen in their projects - roller coasters, deep-sea submarines, and more. Second, inclusiveness. Diversity is good, but it s really inclusiveness that matters. I saw how deeply this runs in HHT s DNA. On my last day in the office and at the end of a successful project, I wanted to pick up a few bottles of champagne for the team. I mentioned this to the president, Mike, and he kindly mentioned,  don t forget to pick up some de-alcoholized bubbles, too.  I had completely overlooked the fact that there were team members that do not drink. It was absolutely front-of-mind for Mike that everyone gets to be included. And speaking of fun, there is a reason you see so many smiles on LinkedIn and Twitter posts. Be it games of Coup at lunch, team events, monthly food culture events, or Friday runs to the DL Chicken Shack, there is a welcoming nature to this team that puts a smile on your face plus they can solve the really challenging problems.",
