            "review_text": "I had a pleasant surprise during my stay at the Holiday Inn Vancouver Airport in Richmond. I had initially avoided it due to its seemingly hidden location in a car dealership parking lot, but I was genuinely impressed. The gym was excellent, my room was impeccably clean, and the staff went above and beyond in providing friendly service. The attached restaurant offered great food and top-notch service, making my stay truly enjoyable. A hidden gem indeed! Food & drinks: Attached restaurant was great.",

            "review_text": "Stayed here a few weeks ago via a last minute reservation when my stay at another nearby hotel went south. This property was just what I needed to help turnaround my day. The staff were friendly, welcomed me with a smile, and even proactively helped me with unloading and storing my bags. Parking a bit odd in terms of layout and design but very manageable once you understand how it works. Staff were quickly responsive to requests I made and food delivery was allowed to deliver the food directly to my room. This hotel is a gem that is of the best Holiday Inns I ve stayed at in a long time. I would be delighted to stay here again next time I m in the area and need a hotel near the airport.",

The facility offers everything you need if you are overnighting to/from a flight or a cruise. It is also a good location to access the city for longer stays. I use the hotel regularly and have yet to have a bad experience. I would recommend it. The only  negative  and it is not the hotel, is the attached restaurants breakfast is quite expensive and the quality is not the best and the service can be slow at times. But that s not the hotel!",

Rooms: very modern, reading lights on the beds, background lighting behind the headboards, soft & firm labeled pillows. pillow top mattress were all very comfortable. Large TV in the room. plenty of lighting and counter space. Fridge/microwave. Bathrooms were excellent. Dove soap is very luxorious. Shower has good pressure.

I had to leave before breakfast, so I cant comment on that. I did have dinner at the in-house restaurant the night I stayed. It was decent enough. I had the chicken wings and the hazy IPA beer. The beer was excellent. The wings were average, but still good. The restaurant has kind of a cafeteria feel to it, which is kinda meh, but it was still good.",

The beds were comfortable and provided a nice place to watch tv on. The television was large and its a smart tv so you can screen mirror although I used a Roku.

So friendly and caring as soon as we walked through the door! We had a rough night at the ferry terminal, had to tow our car and were low on money. We didnt have a reservation but they could see we had a bad night so they took us in right away, gave us a complimentary drink and a deal for the room. They even let us check out at a later time so we didnt have to wait 2 hrs at the car dealership to get our vehicle back. THIS IS HOW CUSTOMER SERVICE SHOULD BE! Thank you so much for your kindness and hospitality! :)",

The desk staff is friendly, theres a Fog & Suds restaurant on premises.  The freeway to Vancouver or the Border is just around the corner. The rooms and public areas are always clean and comfortable.  The housekeeping staff always calls if we forget an item. I prefer this Holiday Inn over the other location in Richmond because the other site gets a lot of international travelers and many rooms or public areas smell of smoke.  The parking isnt nearly as good either.",

            "review_text": "Amazing stay. The gentleman at the front desk was soooooo incredibly helpful and accommodating, setting up cab rides, wake up calls, and shuttle rides for myself and my infant daughter when we recently stayed to have her congenital heart condition followed-up at BC Childrens Hospital. He was cheery and friendly and answered all of our questions, as well as informing us about all the Covid policies we needed to know about. The room was exceptionally clean and comfortable and even though Ive been sleep-deprived with a newborn, super grouchy from postpartum hormones, and stressed to the max dealing with a baby with severe previously-unknown health complications after birth (literally every reason to be in a bad mood with a short fuse right now...) it felt like a mini vacation! We will be visiting Vancouver frequently over the next year and we absolutely will NOT hesitate to stay here again. Thank you for going the extra mile, having exceptional customer service and cleanliness, and being a small ray of sunshine and comfort in an otherwise stressful and horrible situation. We appreciate it so much.",
