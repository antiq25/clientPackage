She has a vast array of experience in the fields of healing, coaching, and has helped me greatly to improve my emotional well-being and life balance. I collaborated with her through emotional image therapy, art therapy, and other methods. We did amazing exercises that brought out many emotions, which always resulted in a cleansing and healing energy that allowed me to have a new, fresh perspective on life and how to tackle everyday problems; whether it was in my daily routines, with friends and family, or in the workplace. It is clear that Tatiana truly cares, and I would highly recommend her services for those looking for help and intuitive guidance.",

I met Tatiana through online search from her website Life in Glow and I found from the first time that Tatiana has very  positive peaceful energy. I had a session with Metaphorical associative cards. ( MAK) We had many  sessions during a year period. I love my experience with Tatiana and  i will recommend her therapy to anyone who need it. It was very interesting to find the solutions from my subconscious mind and open the idea to my inner soul. I would encourage anyone who is searching for emotional peace and calm to book a session with her. Thank you Tatiana it was very interesting and I am in love with the MAK cards now, and looking forward to see you again Sent from my iPhone",

I don t know how, but I even touched on topics that I thought about but didn t voice. It feels like everything is falling into place. She approached everything very thoroughly, carefully leads the session, you can feel sincere immersion and interest! But the main thing is what conclusions I made and where to go for at least the next couple of years. Because of the events in Ukraine, I had to start my life from scratch and of course there were questions about whether I should continue to engage in the same activities and whether I was on my way, the consultation helped me understand all this Many thanks",

I liked that the methodology was selected according to my request - initially I came to the session on metaphorical cards, but in the process of work it became clear that EOT would be better suited for solving the problem. The EOT method is unique, but working with Tatyana was easy and environmentally friendly. Good support and at the same time complete immersion in work. I am pleased!",

These sessions gave me the opportunity to look at my difficulties from a new angle, and I gained a greater understanding of where to move next. Thank you for your attentive and careful accompaniment in this difficult study. Our work helped me clarify my request and see the steps through which I was able to ultimately achieve the desired result. Thank you so much",
