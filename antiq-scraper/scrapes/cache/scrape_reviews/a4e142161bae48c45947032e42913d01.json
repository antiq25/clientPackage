We are definitely going to continue using Vancouver Premium Packaging for more of our future projects :). Definitely recommend them!",

            "review_text": "I used VPP for a custom triangular-shaped jewellery box. They are a great company to work with and helped bring my vision of the box beautifully to life from conception to delivery. The team at VPP displayed attention to detail and ensured that every aspect of the box met my expectations. The price was very fair and competitive as well. Their communication throughout the process was great. They kept me updated on the progress and promptly responded to any questions or concerns I had. I was also impressed by the quality of the materials used. The boxes not only look amazing but also feel sturdy and well-constructed. Overall, my experience with Vancouver Premium Packaging was excellent, and I highly recommend them for any custom packaging needs. Their expertise, attention to detail, and great customer service make them a standout choice.",
