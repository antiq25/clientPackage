Sean executed them well on the plate by placing them in the order as the menu so we d know which variety we were eating. The fresh prawn cocktail were huge and meaty and the fried oyster were so crunchy and delicious. Fries were perfectly crunchy. I love the cozy environment and the window seat is great for eating and people watching. I will definitely be back.  Highly recommend.",

Top class fresh oysters, usually 6-7 varieties to choose from. The raw shucked are outstanding - the shucker is a master. We had 2 dozen raw and each was a work of shucking art - each oyster perfectly separated from its shell, undamaged in any way. And with the liquor intact. That is some skill. Hats off! Oh, and the homemade chili-vodka condiment? Inspired! The fried oysters were big meaty west coasters, perfectly crispy, juicy. I want to go back with a bigger group, so we can try them all. Big thanks to the owners - such nice people",

On the edge of china town which would seem like the middle of no where, then you walk in  woot woot woot oyster heaven , served up by a duo shucker and server, fried oysters were crispy and yet so juicy and the half shell selection was delightful fresh and came with the expected accoutrements. For a little hole in the wall Oyster bar on the edge of town. Chinatown. I didn t want to leave. Fresh beer and an interesting take on the bubbly. Love this place.",

Me and my friend went there yesterday and each of us ate approximately 20! We ordered white wine as well, perfect match! They also offered few sauces for your own table that you can choose. Price is reasonable and good service! I left my key on Sunday and unfortunately they closed on Monday. I was so frustrated the whole night. I tried to massaged them through google map which I won t expect to receive prompt responses. However, The owner (I think he is the owner) replied my massaged the next day morning, and he was so nice and helpful, he went back to the restaurant to pass me the key on the day suppose to be closed. It was a great experience, so I bought two drinks for him and his wife as a gift for doing all this. Hahahahahha highly recommend that you to go there! Try the fresh and affordable fresh oyster!",

The wealth of knowledge that they have and share is incredible. It really feels like youre getting a tailor made made experience in a warm, cozy and friendly place. The selection of oysters is great too, with lots of varieties to choose from from both the east and west coast. The cherry on top...they played Al Green in the background.

The place used to be a Chinese Bookstore, and sold random Asian junk from time to time and it was a DVD store after that. The place has been renovated into a brand new restaurant with new wood inside, keeping it simple and a great layout. The oysters that are served here change daily, from what I heard. We ordered 4 dozen of daily oysters and finished it all in an hour. The shucking skills of the chef are amazing, because I didnt find a chipped shell in my oysters. The waiter that was serving us is a cutie too. He was easy on the eyes and had a British accent. He was attentive and very kind to us. Enjoyed his companion for a while :)",

When we visited, the board boasted 10 types of oysters, featuring a wide selection of oysters harvested locally, on the east coast ( from Prince Edward Island) to even overseas. The oysters are lovingly served with a side of fresh horseradish, lemon and an assortment of homemade and bottled sauces. Star of the night were the Kaipara flown in overnight from New Zealand, simply sublime. The steamed muscles were sizeable, steeped in a rich creamy broth complemented by fresh onions that added some crunch to the taste. Perhaps the only disappointment was the freshly shuckled live sea scallop from Qualicum, BC. At $7 a pop I was expecting fireworks, but the taste was slightly underwhelming.",
