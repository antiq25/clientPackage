The food is really well executed and luxurious without being fussy.  Owners Bailey and Mat (of whom weve been fans since their days with Collective Hospitality) have nailed it with comfortable, friendly service and excellent food.  We went for a special event and will keep coming back, just because its worth the trip. Vegetarian options: Great options for most dietary restrictions and preferences.  The staff is super helpful and friendly with suggestions.",

            "review_text": "Very chill room, with excellent, attentive service and delicious, inventive twists on French/Euro classics. Unbelievable value at $64/pp for the tasting menu. What was unexpected was that the dishes we werent considering a la carte turned out to be total hits. The raddiccio, cheddar, apple and ham salad was incredible - light, with a sweet and savory balance. The lingcod had the most ethereal vadouvan spiced sauce and flavourful fingerling potatoes. And the sauce gribiche for the cured steelhead was a standout. The final savoury course - the pork cheeks with spaetzle, plentiful chanterelles and sourdough breadcrumb - was perfection. Loved everything about the place, and unbeatable value with todays prices. Highly recommend.",

Its all in the details and they are on point on all details.  The brioche with liver pate/foie gras with the concord grape compote was beyond... it may beat every Parisian version Ive ever had.  The ingredients ... such as the tomatoes...were noteworthy.  The hen of the woods was so finely dusted prior to the deep fry... it was astonishing.  Congrats and I have already booked myself in for 2 more dates as I know this city will make it difficult to get in once word spreads. Vegetarian options: Many options and delicious. Dietary restrictions: They were so helpful with suggestions.",

            "review_text": "Wow! that is the first word that me and my girlfriend said after finishing our dinner date at Garys. Where to start? they have done everything remarkably on their FIRST opening day. Ambience : We love, love the decorations and the ambience, combining simple white and black color. The space is small but feels very warm and comforting Foods : We got the 64$ menu per person for two people which allow us to get 2 snacks, two appetizers, two main course and a dessert. The foods are actually above our expectations. We know we will get good foods, but we expect to eat at duffins or panago after because we thought we will be still hungry due to the portion in reality, the foods portion is PERFECT for two people. Flavour wise, combining fresh ingredients from local farms and fisheries, we feel that every food has been given much thought, care and love. Everything is fresh, from the lettuce to the lingcod. Our favourite of the night was the pork cheek. WE DONT HAVE TO CHEW IT!! it was so tender and so much flavours. Service : top notch service. Jes served us yesterday and she was so informative, polite and very thoughtful, explaining the menu and cater to my girlfriends spice intolerance very very seriously. She feels like a friend, not a server! Also, I drink lots and lots of water, so i appreciate tht they put a bottle of water on our table! Overall 5/5. We will come back and TELL our friends to come here because we believe Garys is a great place to be and a place for people to feel comfortable, full and feel welcomed everytime. GOOD JOB!",

Awesome selection of wines both by the bottle and a rotating selection by the glass. The food menu was the perfect size. A good amount of choice without being overwhelming. We debated getting the menu for the table (very reasonable price!) but elected to make our own selections. Two small plates, two large plates, and two desserts was the ideal amount of food for the two of us. The service was excellent! Jess was super friendly and made some great wine recommendations to pair with the food! For the quality of food and the level of service, I think the price is very fair!

Servers were attentive and knowledgeable, and the room is inviting and comfortable. If you opt for dessert, the chocolate mousse is a lot and probably could have been half the size for something so rich, but thats hardly something to hold against them.

The blue cheese salad was also divine, as were the fabulous wines we tried. The only reason this isn t getting all 5/5 s is it was so incredibly loud it was nearly impossible to have a conversation.",
