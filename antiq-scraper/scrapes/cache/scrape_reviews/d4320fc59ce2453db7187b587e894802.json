We went straight from the train station to the restaurant and had the best meal of our trip so far. The crab baguette was fantastic. Crusty yet soft baguette with an explosion of flavors. The fennel slaw added an amazing crunch and flavor. We also had the salmonito wrap. Fresh and fantastic - the salmon was cut right then and there to make our wrap. The fries were excellent too and we dipped them in the housemade tartar sauce. The staff was incredible and made sure we were happy with our food. I don t often leave reviews but this was too good not to note. Take the time to visit this slightly out of the way spot. You won t be disappointed. I m hoping my first visit to Vancouver won t be my last because I ll be dreaming of this food for awhile.",

I was recommended to try the halibut and, oh boy! Heavenly, not oily at all, crispy and light, seasoned to perfection. A generous serving of fish on a bed of fantastic fries, coleslaw and tartar dip. Super friendly staff, cool and laidback interior, with some seating by the window. Really really recommended, as they focus on local, seasonal and sustainable seafood. Really awesome!",

            "review_text": "Its usually halibut, salmon, or cod managed to veer off my typical menu choices and explore the Arctic Char for my Fish and Chips order. From the onset, the service representative demonstrated a commendable level of hospitality and eagerness to cater to this unique request since it was not on the menu that was very nice of them. Now, onto the main event - the Arctic Char Fish and Chips. To say it was superb would be an understatement. The perfectly fried Arctic Char exceeded all my expectations. It was succulent and full of flavour, pairing harmoniously with the crispy chips. This dish struck a perfect balance between the delicate fish and the satisfyingly crunchy chips. Its like a perfect balance between trout and salmon in taste. This was, without a doubt, the best Arctic Char Fish and Chips I have ever had in Canada. Their tartar sauce is also to die for they now sell it in mason jars great choice. Rating: 5/5 Stars",

The batter was perfectly crispy, providing that satisfying crunch with every bite. The fish itself was incredibly fresh, flaky, and full of flavor. It was clear that only the highest quality ingredients were used. I cant wait to return and indulge in another round of their mouthwatering fish and chips.",

Absolutely delicious. The fries were also very good, tasted freshly cut and fried, somewhat like NY Fries. We got takeout so the oysters were a bit overcooked and cold by the time we got home. But when eating at the counter, very nice! This time, disappointed with the size. I ordered four oysters, and at $3.99 each, I expected them to be bigger.

            "review_text": "Best gluten-free fish and chips I ever had anywhere in the world. (~$15) Its hard to find a place that does gluten free batter and also have a seperate fryer for that. Cod was very fresh, the batter is crispy, yet light and not oily. The one piece portion is actually quite filling even it looks small in the picture. (Also comes with alot of fries). Good condiments: A slice of fresh lemon, container of gourmet tartar sauce (likely made inhouse?), and things you can request like ketchup, hot sauce, malt vinegar.  Hot sauce seems homemade too. Chips are more like north american style fries, the shoestring kind. I would be having a thicker cut if I had fish and chips where its a native dish (UK/NZ/OZ), so the chips here were so-so for me, but still warm and fresh... Just feels greasier because of this cut. Luckily theres some very refreshing coleslaw on the side and I really enjoyed that. I think it had cabbage and kale in it. I also tried their clam chowder, also gluten free. It was very hearty and you could tell there are wasnt any artificial flavouring, the flavour was just powered by alot of clams and celery/carrot/potato base.  The portion is quite small but it was a nice side to have (~$7).  Its not cream based, just very tender potatoes that are driving the thickness. There is a counter for buying fresh fish and fish patties, and local artisanal condiments.  The people working are very friendly.  Highly recommended for a quick bite, its about 7 mins wait only.",

The waitress said it is sometimes closed during lunch times.  She didnt give a reason why.  I ordered the blackened steelhead and rice.  It was served in a frying pan.  The fish was tender and moist.  It melted in my mouth.  The yellow rice was good.  It came with lemon caper sauce.  It was the first time I tried steelhead and blackened cooking method.  I was impressed with my meal.  I intend to come back and try the arctic char.  First time that I heard of this fish.",

We are actively looking for a solution for the small potatoes we are getting which turns into small and unwanted fries. I am happy to say a few of our ideas are about to become reality! One of which is turning the smaller potatoes into meals that me can hand to the homeless/turning them into potato chips. We should be up and running in a few weeks with this program! Not only will this result in larger potatoes for our fries, but our smaller ones dont go to waste! Thank you for your continued support!",

            "review_text": "After hearing a couple of friends rave about this place on Main Street, and their fish & chips in particular, I decided to give it a try. Came inside on Saturday afternoon (face mask required) and was immediately greeted by an employee, super friendly and efficient, he took our orders: Two piece halibut, and 2 piece salmon, and we picked up a couple of beverages from a well-stocked fridge on the side. The restaurant side is relatively small, with sitting available for 6 people, but we were lucky and found ourselves a couple of seats. After about 10 minutes our order was brought to us, it was amazing! I opened my compostable container and found 2 huge pieces of halibut in a bed of french fries and a scoop of cold slaw. The fish was thick and tasty, the batter gold and crispy, deep fried to perfection... fries cut small, perfect size... cold slaw tangy and super fresh. Order came with a container with tartar sauce and catsup. After the halibut, I tried a piece of salmon, presented exactly as the first, and equally tasty and crispy! Now its my turn to recommenf this place to others, check them out! They have take-out as an option, if you prefer. To round this establishment out, they have a fresh fish section inside as well, with a very nice selection of seafood to bring back home.",

Seating is very causal, with a few tables and benches.  The pacific cod and chips combo, fish taco, mushy peas, crispy oysters and clam chowder were all amazing.  The fish is perfectly made with a thin coat of batter thats fried with a balance of crispiness and soft texture.  The tasty batter does not soak up too much oil, thus it isnt too greasy.

The Chowder was fresh creamy and rich without being heavy. The fish and Chips were crispy and just the right amount of flavour - never oily.... and the Tartar Sauce is to die fo! Traditional TarTar sauce is like nothing you have had before. And did you know that fish stay fresher longer when on bamboo boards as opposed to plastic? Check this out as your next grab and go good food stop.",
