The beef was perfectly cooked, succulent and for a change, the patty is bigger than the bun, yes! The brioche was nice and soft with a nice bite. The brussels sprouts were perfectly roasted, and best of all, the fries are real french fries. We plan to designate ChitChat our official Burger restaurant. Wvee wvill beee back!",

Upon a friend s prodding I went finally visited last weekend. The owner is Albanian and super friendly. They have a limited menu which they do really well. The food was so good that I went back the next day to have more. The patio is a bit cramped but that s with all the patios on Granville street. The street s ambiance makes up for it. The inside is very well done and the music and friendly service only add to the atmosphere. Over the two visits I ve ordered the veggie and the pulled chicken burgers, and the chulu chulu fries. Everything was exceptional. The burgers are SO cheap for a sit down restaurant but taste absolutely gourmet. Do check out their extensive section of dips that you can order with your food. I particularly liked the spicy feta dip. I m coming back here many more times for sure!",

Its the little sister of Hungry Guys across the street - totally different eats, but same great taste (everything made in house) and good value. Service was also a 10/10. Highlight 100% was the strawberry cheesecake milkshake!  They make the ice cream themselves! Tastes like a dairy Queen strawberry cheesecake Blizzard, but less sweet - perfect really, with a little sugar boost on the rim with some nostalgic nerd candies! If I could make a single suggestion...Id appreciate a music playlist with less profanity. Not to be a prude but I got sick of listening to F this F that on every.single.song.",

The staff was super welcoming and kind, seating us quickly and accommodating our request to sit inside. The burgers were so good, with their warm buttery buns and fresh homemade beef patties. The cocktails & beer selection were excellent. The service was fast and food was fresh when it arrived. Only minor issue was the kitchen failed to add requested toppings to the burger, which kind of sucked, but once we told the server he was super apologetic. Highly recommend chit chat burger bar!",

Truely one of my favourite establishments in the city, and Ive been here for 24 years. Walking by and the doorman said Good evening, come try our burgers and if you dont find them absolutely perfect I will pay for your entire meal. Needless to say, I paid for the dinner that night. That was a month ago. I have gone back 4 times now and its been consistently excellent. I CANNOT stress how much I enjoyed this place. One visit and I knew Id be back. I never simp for random eateries, but this place got me VIBING.",

We were walking back and a rocket of a man, maybe in his late 40s with a grey ponytail, probably the owner, sorry I forgot your name bud, opened and closed us in a span of 3 seconds. Complimented the ladies we were with after checking their IDs and we were inside in a matter of seconds with our 10 people split group. Place is nice, with trees inside and your typical Philips hue coloured lights with salsa music and smiling waitresses. Good music and man oh man the burgers are cheap and good. Had the cheeseburger and fries. Nobody complained about the food and the prices. Apologies to the owner but he probably didn t expect us to get rowdy. We were all smushfaced. Money rained from the ceiling, baby Jesus floated down from the hue light saturated rafter and my life goals were instantly fulfilled. I can die happy, twice. Thanks, attractive pony tail man owner guy. We re still talking about how you 3 second closed a group of salespeople with your ridiculous charm to this day. Tl;dr: Door guy / owner is a rocket. Waitresses are units. Food is too good. I have no idea how they pay rent.",

Then, the burgers, oh boy...everything from the buns to the meat were tasty, flavorful, juicy and... just delicious! Worth every penny! Finally, but not the least important, the music! Who ever is the Dj in charge of those mixes... respect! Old school stuff combined with the new stuff, in a very pleasant summer beach-terrace-downtowny-nightclub combination made our dinner quite a delightful experience. Definitely coming back soon!",

Some surprising food (make their own churros for the chocolate churro milkshake...warm, crunchy, and sugary, mmm). The happy hour menu has great deals (enough mint in the mojito to take home and save for my own cooking). The ambience a nice surprise for this part of the strip and you wouldnt expect such a cool, comfortable, and fresh interior based on the outside. Have been there several times now and its a regular for four of us.",
