Speaking as a very small scale player, I was amazed at how generous Michael was with his time in guiding me towards the right equipment solutions. The team was quick to respond, flexible with my needs, and overall enjoyable to work with. Looking forward to partnering with Prettech again in the future as we scale up our business.",

For travel across the ocean they arrived rather quickly, installation wasnt too complicated, cooling system was plumbed and we were up and running.

Every piece of a equipment is checked and double checked to ensure the best quality product, prior to shipping. These checks do include welds. At Prettech Canada we pride ourselves on the quality of the product we provide to our customers. Stout is a well known company and a solid competitor for smaller equipment. I am very glad that they were able to take care of your business needs. Stout Tanks and Kettles has a great reputation. Stout does ship from China. I think that every American and Canadian business would love to have North American based assembly. Given that you love your new tanks, you can see that outsourced assembly does not inherently indicate poor quality. It does however allow companies like Stout Tanks and Kettles to offer prices that are more reasonable for a business such as yours. When we last spoke, I was not aware that your complaint included welding issues. Please feel free to reach out to me directly to address your concerns in more detail. Happy Brewing!",

Our company did a warranty repair for Mike in 2017 and still have not been paid for our work, despite numerous attempts to collect. Buyer beware - this company owes us over $6,000.00 and refuses to pay. As a reply to your reply: You hired us 3 years ago in 2017. This is when we did the work. We were never paid for that work. The cost of the repair was communicated throughout the process, it was inside the tank on an outlet in a very difficult to get to spot. We needed to chase the crack because each time we attempted to repair, it would spider out further. We brought in NDT testing (after you approved it) to confirm that the repair was good. We travelled to Cold Lake twice (290+KM one way) to complete this repair. We have been out of pocket for the testing, the materials required, travel and the labor for 3 years. We have attempted to collect. Asking for photos of an obscure and hard to get at part of a tank we have already repaired is unwarranted. Ask the client. His tank did not leak after the repair.",

The tank that had the 2 inch specialty weld done on it. The value of the tank was $5200 dollars the 2 inch fix was $6000 I believe Prettech Asia asked for photos and they werent provided and the client Prettech Asia had trouble justifying there *exorbitant bill*.
