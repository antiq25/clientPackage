            "review_text": "I visited North Vancouver District the first time just to try the food here. Honestly, they are best fish and chips Ive ever had better others Ive had in Greater Vancouver! The in-house tartar sauce was sooo delicious as well (can squeeze out as much as I want); it had a fresh, tarty dill taste. The onion rings and oyster were good. And the tomato juice was tasty and refreshing. The mushy peas, however, were not my cup of tea (it, to me, is like a coarse base puree thats just salted). It was quite the satiating lunch; perfect for going to a hike trail afterward.  Moreover, I did not need to eat dinner. As for the service, its excellent. I liked the waitress personality; shes chill and accommodating.",

I also love that they wrap their Togo orders in paper + newspaper, a real throwback to the old days. No matter what kind of fish you get C-Lovers is the place to go in North Van.
