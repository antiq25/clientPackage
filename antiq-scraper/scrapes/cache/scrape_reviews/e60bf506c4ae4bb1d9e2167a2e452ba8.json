            "review_text": "Highly recommend this eco/gastronomic tour. At 2+ hours, would make a great add-on to your day exploring beautiful Stanley Park. I rode my bike along the Seawall to the rendezvous point and added a wonderful 2nd Beach ocean swim at the end; a perfect way to experience the park for locals and visitors alike while also learning about BC West coast natural history and ecology. The feast on the beach was beyond my expectations: Dungeness   crab, smoked salmon, mussels, scallops, local wild mushrooms, sea asparagus and huckleberry tarts.  This tour would be a great idea for a foodie group, group birthday event or stagette/hen party.",
