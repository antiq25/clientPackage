            "review_text": "This day would of not been complete without my dress. After struggling to find anything different in wedding dresses I contacted Hrissa at Elika in Love. I had seen a picture of the dress I loved but it wasn t in stock. So I went in for a consultation to see what we could do. Over 30 swatches of lace later I picked the lace I thought was pretty. You can imagine how thrilled I was when it turned out to be stunning with tiny tasteful sequins, the perfect accent to my winter wedding. Through my meetings with Hrissa she hand crafted the dress of my dreams. I never thought I d get the  say yes to the dress  feeling but I couldn t stop smiling. And on the day of my wedding I didn t want to take it off, stunning and comfortable. I can t wait to have the reception so I can wear it again.",

To be honest with you I ve probably visited about 9 store before I came to this one and she was the nicest out of all those other bridal stores. I actually was eyeing another dress online and they didn t have it in stock to try. Hrissa, took the time to show me on a mannequin how the dress might look on me. Because she is a designer as well, she gave me a lot of insight on dresses that would look good on my body. While I didn t find my dress this visit with her, she gave me a lot of pointers on what to look for in the future. Also the dresses she designs herself are just gorgeous, definitely visit this spot (very boho/New York fashion week!)! Her designs are just soooo dreamyyy",

It was important to me during my wedding to work with designers who made beautiful things, particularly if they were involved in the process. So, on a trip to Vancouver I met Hrissa and ended up buying the first dress I tried on! It was lovely and perfect and looks as great in the photos as it felt to wear it. I also loved that I was able to get the dress in a colour that was verging on cream -- I have never felt really good wearing white or even ivory. And it matched the day and my husbands suit perfectly. Pro tip: Because if the train, the Athena works really well if you get married on a windy day.",

Although professional, Hrissa is not precious with her designs and truly works with the wearer to tailor the dress to fit the married vision of the designer and the wearer. Shes open to requests for custom tweaks, and makes recommendations when the need to be lead is evidenced.

It was such a calm, comfortable experience, like a visit with a friend.
