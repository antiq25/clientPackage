            "review_text": "We shared a chefs tasting menu and sat at the Chefs bar. The entire experience was perfect. As we were being seated we were asked where we are from and they confirmed that it was a special occasion. The exceptional service continued throughout the evening. The food was exquisite. Vegan fare rarely rises to such heights. Attention was paid to presentation, flavor combinations, and textures. The Beet tartar and the chickpea tofu stood out to my mind, but nothing was wanting. The desserts were luscious. The chocolate layer cake with crunchy bottom, orange gelee, and a sprinkle of salt to heighten the senses was, like the rest of the meal a delight for the eyes and senses on multiple levels. The pear tart was perfectly cooked with the fruit holding its shape and texture, not too sweet, with a touch of cinnamon. I enjoyed a non-alcoholic beer and an NA gin and tonic that were recommended and I would gladly order again. My partner really enjoyed her whiskey cocktail (with alcohol) and her recommended glass of white wine. We will happily be back. Vegetarian options: Its a vegan restaurant. Dietary restrictions: They checked with us early on for any dietary restrictions. We had none, but they were clearly willing to accommodate.",

Every dish was full of flavour, texture, and tastiness! The only dish we thought was okay was their dessert, but to top that off they had the best rhubarb caramel (which we would love to purchase, except they said that wasn t possible ughhh). Would definitely revisit Folke again. Their service was also exceptional and the food came out really fast as well!",

            "review_text": "Super unique and amazing vegan food with complex, unique flavors that really feature the vegetables and their flavors in unique and unexpected ways. So many vegan dishes and restaurants focus on the seasonings and sauces only but Folke chefs (magicians) really pull forward the natural flavors putting veggies herbs and legumes on center stage. If I wasn t already vegan, this dining experience would have surely turned me. Also, next level gourmet tater tots; tapioca mushroom dumpling were insane; fried chickpea tofu  so fantastic. We got the tasting menu which was incredible at only $85 CAD and little morsels of a bunch of different dishes so you get to try a lot of variety but plenty of food left us satisfied and full by the time dessert came. The best Michelin restaurant I ve been to yet! Vegetarian options: Gourmet vegan",

My husband and I had the Chefs Tasting with wine pairing while sitting at the counter looking in to the kitchen. Watching the chefs prepare our meal, as well as others, was so interesting.  Silly as it sounds, it was like watching a choreographed ballet to create an amazing meal!  Each dish was beautifully plated, incredibly delicious, with fresh local products, that were so tasty, satisfying and satiating.  We were so full at the end of the tasting menu!  The wine pairing was also so well thought out and each glass complimented the food perfectly! Each dish and glass of wine was presented with a brief explanation.  Everyone of the staff were very kind and we had the good fortune to meet Pricilla and Chef Colin the owners, who both took the time to visit with us and made us feel very welcome in their beautiful restaurant! I definitely recommend this restaurant and we will be back next time we are in Vancouver, as we were visiting from Los Angeles.   Thank you so much Stu from Good Dogs for recommending Folke to us!",

Despite the restaurant being full, our waiters were attentive, knowledgeable, and super-friendly. Folke has also progressed beyond the West s barbaric and primitive tipping culture by simply paying staff properly. Kudos for that. We had the tasting menu with wine pairing, and all of the food was spectacular. The bolognese and the tagliatelle were the best vegan dishes I ve had. Portions were a bit small, but I was comfortably full afterwards. Admirably, the restaurant uses lesser-known wineries, many from Vancouver Island, which despite not being known for producing good wine, made for some interesting pairings (and a few bad ones). All 3 cocktails were great, my favorite being the gin one. Easily the best vegan restaurant in Vancouver. I ll return often!",

Service, Food and drinks, all exceptional. We love it here.  I highly recommend to try different seasons, more preserves and pickles in the winter/spring and end of summer great fruit and veggies. I cant wait to see what they do in the fall. Every visit makes me appreciate the mad scientists that these chefs are and what they do with fresh ingredients.  I stand by that the price is reasonable for the tasting menu. Based on one visit. We love vegetables but I was reluctant, it seemed a little pricey for veggies. I was wrong. We had the tasting menu for two which included all but one of the items on the menu. The pickles, the tomatoes, the beets, the shishito peppers, the beans, the potatoes, the dumplings, the noodles and the list goes on--- all served uniquely, well timed and well portioned, we each had our favorite but they were all close in being the best of the evening. The subtle use of charring, and the gentleness of their deep frying, the love of pickling fermenting and dehydrating ( I guess all preserves) was on the display, the attention to detail in the sauces, with each sauce complimenting the vegetable being served. The service was smart, leave the starch to the end, give enough time between servings to savour the flavours, that way we dont fill up because fill up we did. The flavours for the most part were asian influenced and were delightful plays on familiar dishes. We started with pickles and ended with a ramen, then a dessert.  The vegetables and the majority of the ingredients were all local The service was excellent kindness and helpfulness from all, one of the chefs periodically came out to serve our dish, explaining the details in each. The tasting menu was $75, I cannot imagine going in for anything less, it is great value, there is a lot of effort that is put into each dish. Compliments to the front of the house, the chef and dishwasher, our cutlery and plates were replaced between each course, that is rare these days. I also need to point out that there is no tipping, yes no tipping. I am sure if you left some cash on the table they would enjoy but each person working has skin in the game at Folke, they enjoy what they are creating and include the service in the prices. Congrats, we will return before the growing season is over and look forward to what you can do in the winter.",

The first time I tried to take my friend to a tasting menu (not at Folke) it wasnt great (every dish had salty/smoked? flavour), which was unfortunate because I had been trying to convince her to try one for a while.

Mushroom dumpling: very flavorful, the dumpling dough is soft and chewy (even a little bit like mochi) Service is amazing every time. Washroom has cute wallpaper, very clean, and the hand soap smells nice. They also offer a free seaweed caramel when you pay the check!

If you re a wine enthusiast (who isn t?), their selection of local BC wineries is a large step above the rest of Vancouver s dining options. 10/10!!

It had lots of umami flavour. Great service and the best caramels at the emd of dinner that melt in your mouth. I am looking forward to dining their again to try more dishes.",

            "review_text": "My friend and I decided to go here a little last minute, but we were able to make a reservation on Sunday morning for 5:30 later that day. We had a fantastic time! Started off with a warm welcome from the staff into the restaurant. Decoration is on the simple side, but classy and welcoming. To start, our waitress offered to bring us samples of any of the drinks if we wanted to try something without committing. We were both really intrigued by the orange wine on the drink list since neither of us had tried orange wine before, so we asked for samples of that. They actually brought us each two samples: the wine from the menu, and another orange wine that they d just brought in and wasn t on the menu yet. The first tasted more conventional, the off-menu wine had a smoky taste yet went down easily. I was pretty into this one, but after two tastings I no longer felt the need for more alcohol, so I ended up ordering their Summer Soda instead, which was refreshing and only very mildly sweet. Our waitress advised us that for 2 people, they recommend 4-6 dishes, so we ordered the Beets, Tofu, Shishito, and Dumplings, plus the Plum dessert. The plates are all portioned for 2 people to share and the portions with this number of dishes worked out well for us - it was a very satisfying meal but I wasnt overstuffed. I think you could split the dinner plates with up to 4 people and everyone would still get a decent taste, but the dessert would be hard to split more than 2 ways, maybe 3. The plates were brought out one at a time, and someone from the kitchen explained each as they brought it. A few comments on each dish (they were all fantastic, this is just to give more detail than what you see on the menu) Beets: This was kind of like a tartare, and was served with crisps. I forget what they said the crisps were made of, but they were kind of different and very tasty, and also pretty light. I really liked the sweetness and floral notes in this one. Tofu: If I had to pick a favourite, this would be it! It was actually chickpea tofu, not soy tofu, which has its own texture and flavour. The tofu itself was very very nice, but the sauce ALMOST stole the show (and the radish, chile, and greens it was garnished with complimented the dish perfectly). I couldve eaten that sauce by the spoonful. Shishito: This was relatively straightforward: shishito peppers, potatoes, and pickled onions in a simple soy-based sauce. What stood out was how everything was cooked to perfection and the quality ingredients. Im not much of a potato person but I found myself enjoying the potatoes as much as the peppers here. Dumplings: Vietnamese-style mushroom filled dumplings in a light ponzu sauce. The flavours worked very well and the cooking was again top-notch. Plum: Fermented plum cake/tart with miso and citrus infusion, with cream and a crumble topping on the side! I loved that this included some unique flavours, yet even though the ingredients sound a little out there, it wasnt one of those things where you eat it and its overwhelming or strange at first, it was really very easy on the palate. Bonus Caramels: Not a proper dish we ordered off the menu, but they brought us each a caramel coated with nori flakes with our bills. I saved mine for the next day. The nori with the caramel was definitely a slightly funky combination, but I ultimately decided I was into it and it left me curious about other ways to incorporate nori in sweets, so this was a fun way to end the experience. Besides the great food, the staff was really amazing. Everyone was polite and passionate about the restaurant, and it was especially nice to be able to learn about the food directly from the chefs. This place could not have done anything better.",

We had: New Potatoes (my favourite dish, so creamy and flavourful) Zucchini Kohlrabi Chilled Ramen Salad Between two people this ended up being more than enough food and the range of flavours across all the dishes was outstanding.

Service was  too good ; our conversation was getting  interrupted by the food and quality checks and the dishes were taken away so quickly, last tiny bit sometimes still on the plates/drinks. At the same time I appreciate the efficiency of that but just a tad slower would be great. Waiting a sec for a sentence to finish or just get a thumbs up perhaps for some more of the check ins might help. It was quite busy and they were super attentive. Thanks for a fabulous dinner. *Update: upon reflection after going to some other good restaurants, and wanting to return to them, I realize that I would not return to Folke because my sentences were interrupted so often by the service. Not everyone would care about this, and I acknowledge that the Folke service was super attentive, chipper, and friendly but if I m looking for a place to catch up with someone, it doesn t feel warm and inviting and I just didn t want to mislead anyone reading this review. Best wishes to them, and no regrets in trying the place. I m a meat eater so I have a lot of options for fancier places.",

They really knew the wines and the menu which was so helpful. I love the design of the menu. Each dish is created around a main component and the menu changes with what is available seasonally. The thought and creativity put into the food is just on point. Cant wait to come back and try the tasting menu.",

Service is  included in the listed price, which is wonderful, too. Interesting dishes, at a reasonable price for their ingenuity and quality. The room is a bit loud, and the menu describes little about the dishes. You get the intricate details about each one verbally, from the friendly wait staff, or all three of the chefs, too, in our case. It is sometimes hard to hear and follow everything that is being explained. FOLKE is definitely a place to visit while it is here.",

A vegetarian restaurant; one attractive draw was the prices include gratuity: In a unique take for this city, the restaurant pays its employees well, including benefits. We asked our server, who confirmed how it was great for her as this policy takes financial care of the servers,  and removes instability regarding wages. The owner, Priscilla, is engaging, warm, friendly; we had a lovely conversation with her towards the end of our meal. We had the tasting menu, amongst 5 girlfriends. A word to describe the food: fresh. Also: unexpected and delicious flavours, including a beet tartare not to be missed, a Vietnamese inspired dumpling, the cabbage dish still makes my mouth water, and the show-stopping pastas: bolognese and pizzocheri will make you wonder why we use noodles at all. We tried every dish on the menu and then some off menu; there wasnt a single disappointment. Despite generous servings, the beautiful dishes were emptied, which meant the mild regret of few leftovers the next day. I want places like this to thrive, for the amazing food offerings, and moreover for the influence it may have over other restaurants to consider the inclusion of gratuity for their servers.",

It opened only a few weeks ago and just might have become the best vegan restaurant in Vancouver, and one of the citys best restaurants of any cuisine. And the service-included philosophy is a lovely break from North Americas undignified and inequitable tipping culture. Improvements? Descriptions of the dishes in the menu, rather than as the dish is delivered, would benefit everyone: achingly cool though a four-word description is, many (those trying to lose weight or better control their diabetes, say) would appreciate knowing that tofu isnt tofu but rather made from carbs. The music could have been more compatible with the serene enjoyment of excellent food. And the portion sizes, especially dessert: it would have been lovely to have been able to enjoy, not just admire, something so good. But these are minor quibbles. Go. Eat. Its wonderful.",

Lots of lovely flavours that worked well together with attractive plating.  The charming and attentive staff were another draw. We loved that the final bill was inclusive of tip - simpler for the customer and (according to one of our lovely waiters) fairer for the staff. Almost, fabulous local wise (some organic - ask for pairings we have great recommendations). A brilliant modern take on West Coast cuisine.",

Every element on the plate is either elevated or transformed.  Many processes are involved in making one dish.  Lots of careful attention to detail, time and passion. Not to mention, they are going out to farms and talking to suppliers about what is fresh to use on the menu.  Thats time and that costs $. If you want to eat at a place that gets its food from a mass supplier, this is not the place for it. If your goal is to stuff yourself at a low price you miss the point of a restaurant like this (although you will be full and happy if you go for the tasting menu like we did - sit at the chefs counter so you can see art in action).  This place is amazing. The homemade chicpea tofu was delicious af.  The seasoning was perfect. They are not trying to pass off a dish as something else.  Its elevated, creative, delicious and beautifully presented.  Its not a great Vegan restaurant, its a great RESTAURANT.",
