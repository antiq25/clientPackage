            "review_text": "I headed straight to The Lobster Man for lunch upon reaching Granville island market. My wife and I ordered Signature and Connecticut lobster roll. I preferred the former while my wife preferred the latter. Both were so good. It s not a restaurant but more of a takeout place with some outdoor seating. I love it as it serves great lobster rolls without much fanfare and sitting outdoors in a casual environment is such an enjoyment. We visited the live seafood next door where we were keen to try the sea urchins. However, they don t cut the sea urchins for you so I decided it was too much hassle to cut it myself. It didn t look as delicious as ones I had in Hokkaido so am ok to give it a pass. Don t miss out on the lobster rolls though.",

            "review_text": "Live lobster, crab, and oysters are often considered some of the best options for seafood enthusiasts for several reasons: 1. Freshness: Live seafood is the epitome of freshness. When you order live lobster, crab, or oysters, you can be confident that youre getting seafood at its peak quality and flavor. 2. Flavor: Live seafood tends to have a more delicate and succulent flavor compared to seafood that has been frozen or stored for an extended period. The natural sweetness of these creatures is best preserved when they are alive until just before cooking. 3. Texture: The texture of live lobster and crab is exceptional. When cooked properly, the meat is tender, juicy, and full of natural juices, making it a delightful dining experience. Oysters, on the other hand, are prized for their unique texture and briny, oceanic taste. 4. Interactive Dining: Theres an interactive aspect to dining on live seafood. Preparing and cracking open a lobster or crab can be a fun and engaging experience, perfect for social gatherings and special occasions. It s really fun dining experience here in lobster man. Especially thank staff Sean. He provided exceptional service. He was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. Sean went above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was enjoyable. We appreciated his recommendations and the way he made us feel well taken care of throughout the meal. Thank you, Sean, for making our visit special!",

Ive made lobster rolls before and its a lotta work. The rolls are generous in portion and other than the miso Mayo (which I didnt really taste) they got the classic just right. Looking forward to trying the Dungy crab roll next time. The reviewer complaining about chives on the roll and foreign ownership... stay home, please. Soup was good too, just wished their cup was a little bigger. Small streetside patio which is great to enjoy when the weather is cooperative.",

            "review_text": "Lobster rolls are ubiquitous on the east coast with varying price ranges depending mostly on location & presentation, sometimes upwards of thirty US dollars. The Lobster Man offers two distinct rolls, the Signature & the Connecticut, that offer significant value for flavour & presentation. Sure, theres some shredded lobster in the mayo, but its topped with generous chunks that almost require the use of the included fork. I ate mine without the fork & it was challenging & satisfying. The brioche bun is mildly sweet, soft, & fluffy. The included lemon & chips in the box make for easy take away. A moist towelette is included because this is hands-on comfort food! (update: prices have increased +30% in 2022)",

Both had a fair and reasonable amount of meat in them, and I appreciated the fresh brioche - the sweetness pairs well with the seafood.

I also topped off both rolls with a bit more melted butter, but again, personal preference.",

There is a small outdoor area where you can sit to smell the ocean breezes while enjoying lobster rolls. The frozen seafood had a wide assortment of seafood and individual portions of frozen mahi mahi, salmon, black cod .
