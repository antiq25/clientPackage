We all ate too much after enjoying our food, which is always the best indication of good comfort food. I enjoyed a massive burger with double most things and added deep fried jalapenos, also had a side of fries, more jalapenos, and poutine and a shake. All hit the spot - burger was juicy and cooked fresh, fries crisp, and I ended up only eating a quarter of my poutine because my kids fought over the rest and didn t share. Both kids say they would return, and their only complaint was the food was so good the ate until they felt ill. Serves them right. A bit more expensive than your regular fast food place, or their that other burger place down the street, but it s worth it. Money well spent, and time enjoyed.",

The attention was great from the 2 staff members. Its amazing how they run all that operation only with 2 people. You can also have shots of tequila and beer and get absolutely hammered right beside other bars at a way cheaper price. Always recommended to visit Veras burger",

Our favourites are the the onion rings, poutine & Buffalo Chicken burger. So good!! We have also ordered it via Uber Eats and it came super fast. The onion rings r fresh and crispy. The fries and poutine are delish. Lots of gravy and cheese. The Buffalo chicken has a sauce on it that is awesome. Not too spicy but just enough kick to give it an amazing flavour. The best thing about this spot, when going in person, is the service. The ladies who work here are very family oriented in the sense that they are personable and remember you when you return. Its really nice to have that special personable service in a city that can sometimes leave you feeling invisible :-) We will keep coming back here...hopefully for a long long time <3",

One time they missed my gravy and I went back up there and she gave me another gravy on top of the one that I purchased and a gift certificate. She has amazing customer service I see her working all the time shes a very hard worker and anyone that could ever write a bad review I would never take seriously.

            "review_text": "After a day of running all around Vancouver before a meeting, I was really craving a burger.  A really good burger.  A spectacular and indulgent burger. Yelp saves me in these situations, so I did a search and headed over to Veras.  Parking was really easy to find on the street.  (Side note: I love parking in Vancouver because it is so easy to do with credit cards.  The flashing green traffic lights I still dont understand...)  I got a little nervous about the outside because the awning is ostentatious and still doesnt really stand out compared to what is next to it, but then I went inside. With hockey playing on four screens, this feels like a very Canadian way of eating a burger, but somehow it doesnt feel too sports-bar-like.  Clean and open, it is easy to read the menus and order.  The cashier was very friendly and told me she would bring the food to me. I ordered sweet potato fries and they were perfect; both crispy and hot. This is a rarity for sweet potato fries, which I can never figure out.  If they have good breading, they arent hot; if they are hot, they dont taste good.  Somehow, Veras pulled it off. The burger was also great. I ordered the works and pulled a few things off because it was so big.  A very sweet, gruff-voiced attendant (possibly the owner) checked on me to see if they needed to fix the order, although it was perfect.  He checked on me at the end, too.  The entire time I was eating, he was constantly cleaning and taking care of tables.  Really incredible service and attention. I am over-the-top impressed.",

Was incredibly good. I ordered two patties on the burger and, even though I made sure to finish, it was a lot of food. I think Ill order just one patty next time. But hot dang this is an amazing burger place. The person running store was just awesome: friendly and welcoming. She even checked on us after we got our food. She made the experience.",

            "review_text": "Veras burger shack is definitely the best burger spot in town by far! Please do not be fooled by the reviews at other places as no other burger place has as good food or staff as this place. We were fooled by the reviews and went to a different burger place and were welcomed with atrociously rude staff and high prices. We then decided to come here where they served us delicious burgers in half the time and money of any other burger place! The best place in town if your looking for a tasty burger I would recommend getting the bacon cheese burger as it was amazing but I m sure anything you get here will be better than the other burger places I.
