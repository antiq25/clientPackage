As a  local Westside Realtor, I also have no hesitation to refer their services out to my Clients as I know they will be taken care of. They are an amazing company.  Customer service is phenomenal.  The guaranteed response time has come into play a few times over the years and I have always been taken care of quickly and efficiently.  Great personal service and follow up.  Professional staff.  I highly recommend Provident Security. I wouldnt choose any other company.",

Having had such a great experience with them in Vancouver (at our home and 2 business locations), it made sense to have them take care of our Whistler place. I am amazed by how much convenience and piece of mind they have given me. Provident has called us when our water sensors went off.  I know that we dodged a huge bullet (a friend didnt know about a slow leaking pipe in their place and it cost them over $100,000 and almost a year in renovations). Provident has also let me into my own place (when I left my keys in Vancouver).  This saved my family and I over 4 hours of travelling time. Provident - you rock",

With the alarm ringing, the thief was in and out in 2 minutes and Provident arrived 1 minute later (i.e., in 3 minutes!) They definitely saved us from a robbery of much greater magnitude. Provident personnel could not have done a better job  - from providing accurate and reassuring details in the initial phone call to us, to greeting us with empathy when we arrived at the house, boarding up the broken window and even cleaning up mud and glass from the interior of the house.  They walked us through what had happened and gave us tips to prevent further break-ins. These two Provident employees really helped offset our distress at being broken into and definitely exemplified the high standards advertised at Provident.  We cannot recommend them more highly.",

I always enjoy the footage of bad guys being arrested on camera after Night Owl spots them, in the dark, after hours.
