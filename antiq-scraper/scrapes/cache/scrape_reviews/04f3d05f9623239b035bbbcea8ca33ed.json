Also the fries are delicious. Service was friendly and attentive. Only note is it s REALLY loud inside, we couldn t hear each other speaking (even the young ones;). I recommend sitting outside.

The place was fully booked the only place available for us was in the heated patio area. The patio areas had plenty of heat lamps and the place was fully closed off so you won t need to worry about rain or snow (we were here during March and it actually snowed during our dinner!) The food was pretty good, we ordered tiger shrimp cocktails, grilled oysters, assorted sashimi platter, seared scallops and a bowl of clams. Our favourite was the seared scallops hands down. We also orders some vegetable dish and they were amazing too! The beets with avocado and warm goat cheese was out of this world! The portion was kind of small so consider yourself warned. But the quality was certainly worthy of the price tag. Would come back again!",

            "review_text": "I did have a hand in building this place, and I do know the owners and chefs..... but that doesnt influence my review of this amazing local tapas restaurant. Quite a varied selection and fresh sheet that is updated so frequently, dare I say daily?!  I recently returned here for the first time since covid with my parents who are exceptionally picky eaters.  We ordered about six to seven plates between the three of us and we were stuffed with the lightest freshest and tastiest foods that their spanish cuisine has to offer. (All with the West coast flare). Oh, and there is an outdoor (but enclosed) patio that makes it feel like a bistro in California. 9/10 would highly recommend, and it could be your new favorite regular place! **Reservations can be very difficult",

I need to express how fresh and creative their menu is - especially when you realize it is all based on what comes in from that days catch. The octopus carpaccio, seared scallops, and the sole were divine. I can recommend all of those plus the mussels, though I have a feeling whatever you order here will end up being good. The one negative I would have is the price point if not for the fact I think the experience was well worth it. We ended up spending around $100 per person this meal.",

Situated in a quaint little neighborhood, Oddfish has a lot of character and its not the atmosphere that lends to it, its the food! We had a selection of delicious dishes: scallops, a sole picatta, an amazing burrata, and we had to throw some fries in there as well. We were hesitant about the Picatta but its a best seller and was very flavorful. Scallops again are exceptionally delicious but a smaller serving as was the burratta. Understand that the portions arent the largest at Oddfish, but they make up for it in taste. Service was good. Not too overbearing and knowledgeable with respect to the menu. Our guy made a few excellent suggestions that we appreciated. If youre interested in a menu centered entirely on seafood and fish, there arent many places better than Oddfish in Vancouver",

Everything was on a pretty high level, Richard, our waiter did his job brilliantly, he was very attentive and his sense of humor made our evening a bit brighter. The restaurants chef is also on the right spot, dishes look like a masterpiece and taste delicious, thank you for that pleasure. Smoked salmon toast and the oysters were my absolute favorites that evening. There were a couple of things that could be improved though: the water glasses look is not really nice, they look old like with scratches and salty traces from a dishwasher. We don t drink alcohol so we had to use those glasses whole evening. I really liked the smoked salmon toast and asked for another one, but second time the toast itself was badly burnt. But Richard made things right by saying that he was sorry and we won t be charged for this one, he also offered to bring some bread so we could trade it with burnt toast, thanks! But putting the toast like that on the plate in the first place is not really nice. Overall it s a really nice spot and we definitely coming back! Thanks Oddfish!",

Really impressed with the attentiveness of the wait staff, the care taken when dealing with a medically needed diet and the nice outdoor atmosphere!  It is better to sit outside as inside is very loud.  Outside is still loud but traffic dependant. Vegetarian options: The menu is heavy plant / vegetarian / seafood oriented.  Despite not being a vegetarian the food was outstanding for flavour! Dietary restrictions: Celiac Disease / Gluten free diet - very accommodating and understood ins and outs of diet needs (such as sweet potato chips fried in oil in pan instead of fryer) and cross contamination.  Another Celiac dining at next table.  Chocolate mousse desert was outstanding! Wheelchair accessibility: One floor.  Did not check washrooms.  We sat outside and let them know that I needed an accessible table and a very suitable one was provided.  The tables are pretty tight together so it was good to warn them.",

My suggestion is to come to this restaurant and share the dishes family style between 3 to 4 people. This gives you an opportunity to try a bit of everything on the menu. Our favourite dishes were the fresh burrata, grilled octopus with spicy romanesco puree and the pasta with chanterelle mushrooms. So insanely good. The wine selection was also very reasonable with a mix of local and international wines. Definitely worth trying out if you are in the mood for great seafood.",

We started with some oysters that were both fresh and delicious. Our server, Lisa, was exceptional at describing specials and welcoming us into her section. Although it was her section, the entire team worked beautifully together at making sure eveey guests was attended to. We selected our meals from the feature menu and highly recommend it. Our appie was the Burrata, and it was spectacular. Paired with our white wine, on their heated patio was heavenly. We shared the Branzino feature and it was light, soft and cooked to perfection. We wanted to ensure a compliment to the cook was sent as it blew our minds. Well done Jonah. If youve got room for dessert, do it. Everything this Odd Fish does is remarkable.",

The light that comes in from the big windows and decor of the place is realy nice even though we were there on a rainy evening. The patio was covered and still open which was surprising! Good to know for next time. We had the spaghetti with tomatoes and basil on special and it was so good. You could tell the pasta was fresh and made in house as they say. It was also very al dente which is what I like a lot about fresh pasta! We also ordered the squid the whole seabass with the harissa sauce. I personally didnt think too much of the seabass as I think I just prefer harissa with more heat but thats just me. The other highlight of our meal was the parsley salad that came with the whole fish. It was SO Good. Like literally a light fresh tangy surprise in your mouth thats like the best contrast after taking a couple bites of the fish. So refreshing. So yum! Id come back for the pasta and am looking forward to trying nook. Our awesome server told us their sister restaurant nook does the daily fresh meat pastas while oddfish does the seafood ones. So excited, I hope they have some parsley salad over there too lol",

No one including my meat loving husband missed it though! The burrata as a starter is a must have. I ve had both the honey pistachio and the seasonal pea mint one. Perfect. I didn t even like burrata before this. The fresh pasta makes a nice side dish with a veggie side too. We shared the halibut but I could have eaten it all! For dessert we had the salted caramel bowl of heaven (not actual name). The only other dessert I ve had elsewhere that is better than this is the date pudding at Rim Rock Cafe. Beyond the food, the servers are all very friendly and attentive. The vibe is  as casual or as dressy as you want .  Very Vancouver. I d you make a reso for the patio know that most of it is covered/enclosed from rain and there are heaters, I was warmer out there than I often feel indoors!",

We also had their 2 daily specials market fish, sea bass and ocean perch which were both very nice. We also had their fresh dozen oysters and vongole pasta for 3 people. Their portion size is not that big, so we ordered a bunch and shared everything. Service: All staffs are attentive and polite. Our waitress went over the daily specials for us with as much detail as possible (herbs, sauce, whether the fish has bones or not, flavours). They seated us out in the patio despite walking in without any reservations. Despite going off on the menu + wine, our will came out to be less than what we expected. (I guess we overestimated the market price).",

These folks were *so fantastic,* the head chef even came out to chat with me, and let me know that the dressing on one of the salads was mayo-based, and collaborate on how to make it differently delicious. The food was *so incredible.* Peak-fresh veggies and fish, beautifully prepared, and perfectly cooked. I highly recommend Oddfish.",

Thats just the way to go at oddfish because you will want everything on the menu plus a few of the many features!! I have absolutely loved everything I have ever eaten here. Creativity prepared fresh seasonal veggies, and seafood! I always feel blown away by something seemingly simple but prepared so deliciously with flavours I wouldn t expect! I love that there are always new tasty features, always expect seafood prepared a little different. The burrata is also perfection. Great oysters and pastas too! The staff and management are so kind, always accommodating, recognize us and give excellent service. Not too fancy but doesn t feel weird to dress up for. Thank you Oddfish!",
