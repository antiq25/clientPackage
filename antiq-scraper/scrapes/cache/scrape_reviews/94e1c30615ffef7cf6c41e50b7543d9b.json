I had a piece of halibut. It was everything I want a piece of battered fish to be. Crispy batter, tender, flaky fish. Excellent fries and tartar sauce. The coleslaw was adequate, but not a show stopper. Its worth a trip, for sure!",

            "review_text": "Great store with more than just seafood items. In a pinch, you could come in and pick up dry pasta, fresh fruits and veg , and of course seafood. I normally come here in the summer for salmon and when the time is right spot prawns and they dont disappoint. A lot of traffic (as you can see from the other posts) are mostly commenting on fish and chips and their other cooked food. Again, its just a portion of what they do. The fish and chips are solid and the batter is not too thick. Got takeout and ate it 20 minutes later and was still crispy. Recommend calling the order in , especially if its getting close to lunch time as there is a high school close by and it can get crowded. People talk about the fries and they are good. For value and quantity, it definitely hits the spot. Also tried the curries eggplant halibut wrap. It was good. Maybe a bit mild for my tastes but for those wanting that light curry flavour with their fish, this would work for you. Parking in the complex , with the highschool crowd etc...can be a bit of a slog depending on the time. Though I find the best and easiest place to park is on the street.",

The fish was delicious, crispy and fresh as expected. We tried sockeye salmon fish, with potato fries, coleslaw salad. We also had the yummy bisque for the first time (a thick seafood fish soup ) with some garlic bread. The prices were very reasonable. Great portion size. The fish and chips dinner is enough for teo people. I will visit this place again for trying the other fish cuisines.",

FAS did not disappoint! We stocked up on FAS sockeye and rockfish filets, then added one healthy cold smoke tuna side as well. The front-of-house staff took time to get us the correct portions, then vacuum seal an extra lot for our freezer. I suspect it wont be long, until were back at Arbutus to stock up again. A special thanks to the team back in Victoria, (Rose, Dee-Lynn, and Aaron) for taking care of us for many years, and to the plant staff and fishermen/women for the hard work, and long hours bringing it to the shop. I highly recommend a stop at the FAS stores, and food truck, if youre visiting!",

This place by far has one of the best fish and chips that Ive ever had in the city, including Steveston Richmond. If you live in Vancouver, come check out this place. Its a seafood shop, selling everything from fresh seafood, to salads and clam chowder. Theres an area to the side where you can order hot food like fish and chips and seafood sandwiches. I ordered for the first time today the lingcod fish and chips with a side of fries. It included a nice portion of creamy coleslaw and chunky creamy tartar sauce with dill slices in it. The beer battered fish was light and crispy, while fried to golden perfection. I will definitely be returning with my partner and friends.",

            "review_text": "I love this place but keep in mind it is expensive. If you live in the area(Closer to North Van, Alot of homes in the area cost well over 2 Million) then you probably earn enough to not have to worry as much about your budget. But thats besides my point I live in Surrey. I go here when Im in the area I have work close by. They have a fresh selection of seafood, and a healthy selection of fine ingredients along the lines of white truffle olive oil(to me this is Fancy stuff as truffles are hard to grow and Even harder to store plus I hear chefs gush about these.) When I look at the assortment of oils and the limited but fresh selection peppers and cheeses. Im not joking my mouth starts to water. Im no chef but I love food then again who doesnt. Also I have been incarcerated which isnt something I like to say but it does give you a different perspective on food once you realize just how bad the food can be then you go to Fancy rich restaurants where the comparison or the spectrum is so vast and far apart is not even fair to call it a comparison. Its like trying to compare McDonalds to an Italian restaurant that serves fresh homemade pasta. You cant compare the two. Finest at Sea. Has it all in the name. They sell the finest and if you talk to the guys and gals here they will tell you exactly what your getting and when is the best time to buy certain fishes. They also have what they call a bistro Im not actually sure what that means. But you can order things like fish n chips. An amazing shrimp sandwich that just mmmm to die for. One Thing that isnt as good as it used to be and it was literally the reason I started coming here is sadly the clam chowder. They used to have a chef here and I call him a chef not because he cooked but because after he left you realized what a chef is. It isnt someone that can cook, its someone that truly takes pride when you come to tell him I came here just to spend money for your cooking. I came here because I think this is the best and nothing else has even come close to this soup. And when he left, sadly the clam chowder has never been the same. I dont know if he used a different method and never left the full recipe or if he would use a few different ingredients from a recipe that was already there but in my eyes I realized he was truly a chef because he elevated that dish to new heights. I hear a lot of people and also cooking shows say that but when you witness it firsthand you realize what that truly means. And its like taking a burger or a recipe from McDonalds and turning it into the burger nobody knows where it came from but everyone knows they want more of and they want to know who made it so that they could say thank you. And you know the sadest (dont know if thats a word but now I say it is) thing is... I never got his name because at the time I took if for granted I was younger and didnt appreciate life as much. Now that I go back and order the clam chowder it isnt as rich. There was a certain thickness to it that just isnt there anymore. And thats not to say it isnt good. Its just not as great as it used to be. And I hate to say that because maybe they try there best there and one of those cooks there see this and think you know F you I try to make it the best I could. But when you see the ingredients surrounding them and then you see the clam chowder barely has any clams or potatoes it feels more like just a plain watered down mushroom soup how can I say its the best when I have had better. But the shrimp Sandwich is still excellent and I love the fish n chips from here I really do. Im just giving my two cents here. I love the seafood salad and the Avocados Shrimp and Lime salad I think its called. My mom loves the orzo salad when they have it. But the one thing I can never leave without is the Salmon Pate. Mmmm it is the best I have had or found and trust me I am picky as all hell when it comes to calling something the best. In Short Finest at the Sea has the Finest you can find(Except that dam clam chowder IM SORRY It isnt.)",
