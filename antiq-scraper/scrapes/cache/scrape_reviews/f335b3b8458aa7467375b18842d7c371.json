Second favourite was the eggplant which was seasoned nicely. The octopus was also cooked to perfection. We were only 2 people so we got full fast. I recommend bringing friends and going as a group of 3 or 4 to try more things and more seafood.",

            "review_text": "I first dined at Como Taperia when I found out that one of the partners was a friend of mine Shaun Layton from being in the restaurant industry. He is amazing and well-experienced in all aspects from being creative with his talents and charm to treating ALL his guests with VIP service and making his guests welcome. So when I went to visit him and dine at Como Taperia, he and his team exceeded all my expectations and this restaurant is one of my favourites. The creative genius from the Chef s menu is delicious and offers a unique variety of taps dishes and an emphasis on sharing. One of my ultimate favourite dishes is the Chef s chilli peppers and a must order as well as the croquettes to start. The Spanish paella is another delicious dish and anything from their specialty meat dishes. Since Shaun is very knowledgeable about spirits and wine Como Taperia has unique wine selections and all priced reasonably. The servers are friendly and professional and know the menu to offer suggestions to what the customer is in the mood to try. The restaurant opens at 4pm and a lineup of eager customers to get in and a constant flow of customers throughout the night. I went recently for my Birthday with two dear friends who hadn t been before and after our amazing fun evening and special VIP attention from my friend Shaun, he gained two more customers and their new favourite restaurant. I can always count on a memorial experience at Como Taperia and highly recommend anyone to visit and enjoy all that Como Taperia has to offer. Thank you to Shaun and his team as I really appreciate it.",

Its a small dining space but luckily there was space for the 2 of us at the bar. The bar tender/server was also very helpful when trying to order. We ordered the goat cheese stuffed peppers, the deep fried eggplant, the clams, the garlic shrimp, and the pork belly. Wow everything was delicious and spaced out perfectly. I was especially fond of the goat cheese peppers and eggplant! I actually still dream of this meal and hope to visit again soon just to eat here! I hope to find something as good as this place in LA! 10/10 would recommend.",

Have these with one of the best sangrias in town. There are also these very interesting fried chili peppers which are mild, but 1 in 10 is really hot, but you dont know which.

I got a glimpse of the atmosphere here and I must say that I am very impressed. The staff are very friendly and it shows that they love what they do. To me thats extremely important because I have worked in a eatery and I see some of my coworkers were very stressed and very unhappy. The end result? The atmosphere was not inviting and the customers saw it too. So coming to an awesome establishment that is very cheerful and very inviting I can see why its so lively. I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants to unwind with a friend or a partner. I am a soloist so I like to be alone but thats my preference. But either way, one can expect to be pleased with the food, the staff and just overall the whole nine yards. Thank you for my order.",

This place is an absolute gem. From the moment we walked in, the staff were exceptional: they were well versed in both the menu and wine options, and EXTREMELY attentive (without being intrusive); we felt like we were guests in someone s home that were being spoiled. This is how dining out should feel. :) We ordered more than a dozen dishes and all of them were incredibly delicious and varied. Hard to make just one recommendation because from what we tried, it seems like the whole menu is top notch (though full disclosure: we did order the eggplant twice). One example: I NEVER eat olives by themselves (though I do enjoy tapenade). However, my experience at Como demonstrated to me that quality does matter, and I not only ended up eating more of the marinated olives than anyone else, but I went home with an entire jar for myself from their grocery shelves! They have an excellent selection of items that you can purchase to take home, (including their fantastic selection of wines). Can t wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. A terrific place to bring friends for a long dinner with drinks. Bravo.",

The staff was incredible making me feel like a best friend and the most important person in the restaurant simultaneously.   It s startling and refreshing. Should probably talk about the food.   Having spent a blessed amount of time in Spain, it felt like it was there again.  It s like they crammed a ton of different lovely Spanish concepts into one eccentric menu and it all works.   Biggest hit for the table were the olives stuffed with anchovies and the lamb meatballs. Wine was direct and special.   Space was warm and loud and exciting.   Firing on all cylinders.",

I thought the menu was going to be too limiting, and I didnt know what to expect from the preserves. However, I was pleasantly surprised once the food came and I truly enjoyed every bite. The fried eggplant, Spanish octopus, and chipirones a la planca particularly stood out for me. Highly recommended others to come here for a casual dinner or for date night!",

Cool Sherry and Vermouth selections add to the variety of flavors on offer, and the Spanish wine selections are focused and well-chosen.  The conservas list is all imported Spanish seafood, which seems a little silly considering our abundance of incredible local seafood... but I understand that its all in the spirit of offering something different than the salmon, albacore, and sablefish available at every other spot in town.  I would prefer to champion local produce, but if everybody had the same food politics as me the world would be a less interesting place.  Vancouver is certainly made more interesting for having Como!",
