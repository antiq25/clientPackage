She investigated, got to the bottom of it, and was a rockstar through it all. A manager had to come in and help, and he was great as well. This is not my closest Home Depot, but I will go out of my way to come here. Every single staff member I deal with is awesome, with a huge care meter and so willing to help. You can tell this store is managed well!",

The only down side was when we received our Fridge, there was 2 small dents; one on each side of the french doors. Sid Moosavi, that works in appliances was the one that helped us from the time of purchase. He was very helpful and resolved the issue immediately. I enjoyed the experience of purchasing with Home Depot. 10/10 would recommend and will definitely purchase at this location again.",

Took it back to home depot and also brought my cabinets in with me and explained the situation to Ken Nguey and Saksham. They quickly identified that I needed a much stronger staple gun to perform the repair so instead of charging me for one, they took one from the rental section and helped me repair my shelves on the spot as it required an air compressor which i didnt have access to either. My shelves are fully repaired now and I am extremely happy with the service I received. Keep up the good work guys!",

The hoses and the nozzles were a very good price point and seem to be good value and construction. Unfortunately I found their vegetables a little picked over and the prices a little steep still. But if I had been looking for flowers, oh my goodness did they ever have a fabulous selection and they look very healthy as well. Their staff was very helpful.",

A big thank you to Lucy for going above and beyond to help solve some of my kitchen problems. She answered all my questions and was very creative in solving my renovation design issues. There s a Home Depot that s closer to my house. I drive the extra 5km because the service (Lucy/Emily) and product range far surpasses all other HD locations in the lower mainland. Customers appreciate honest and expert advice. I hope head office acknowledges employees. Show your customers corporate is listening and values our feedback.  I d like to shop at a store that values its staff. So Please do that. People matter",

All I needed to do was drill a few holes of various sizes into a wooden box (to hide charging cables for my devices). My plan was to rent the drill, do the job there and then and then turn it back in. The guy who helped me was Ken. He was a super nice guy. Not only did he not charge me for the drill, he drilled all the holes for me while I held the box in place! You just dont get that kind of service or total customer service attitude much anymore and I really appreciated it. It meant a lot to me. I go to that store a lot and this just made me feel even better about the place. Thank you very much for your help, Ken! Youre a good guy and Home Depot is lucky to have you! Derek",

Im quite handy and know how to fix a lot of things and am often spoken down to buy male associates especially but these two associates worked very hard to troubleshoot this with me and I am sorry to all the other customers because I did dominate their time but they solved a huge problem for me and Im forever thankful.",

The floor staff were helpful, but I came across a gentleman whose name was Kevin, if I remember correctly. He was exceptionally helpful and knowledgeable in every department; he made my shopping trip less stressful and found all the items that I required. Even an item that was thought not to be on the shelf, Kevin took the extra mile, brought out a large ladder and found it for me in no time. I really appreciate your help Mr. Kevin! God bless you.

Went to this Home Depot location after the glazed pots I wanted was no longer available at another location nearby.  Got to the store only to find out that the pot was $4.98 rather than the $2.00 in the first store I went to.  Told John about it and without hesitation he matched the lower price.  Really appreciate him and the rest of the staff for being so helpful.",

We moved here about 2 years ago and were held hostage by Home Depot because we ordered special hardwood flooring and were told to wait until there was installers available. We waited for close to 1 month, and our flooring was just sitting there waiting for installation. We couldnt do anything until we had the flooring installed   so finally,  we picked it up ourselves and had someone,  who did a fabulous job, install it for us beginning the day after we contacted him. Finally,  we decorated our new home and didnt have to be camping in our home any longer. Two weeks later,  we got a call from Home Depot advising that they still didnt have an installer available but should have one in about 2 weeks. The person who called actually got upset when we told them that we had it installed by someone who was available.!!! I can honestly say that I have never seen such bad service from any operation, especially considering that we bought top of the line flooring and have spent a lot of money at Home Depot both in Vancouver and now here. We continue to shop there, but know enough not to try to find any service & find what we need on our own. That being said,  Home Depot have an excellent selection and their prices are very reasonable. Just dont expect much in the customer service area.",

If not for him, I would have brought them home and set them up wrong, resulting in failure to work and thus a return on the product. I appreciated the extra help immensely as we really need the product working now not later and also being in a wheelchair to have to make a waste of extra trips only to find out it was my misuse, for a question I didnt know to ask, I am very grateful. It being my first time in the store, it was also nice to be in store that is definitely wheelchair friendly. Considering how fast the staff member came to ask if I needed help, I know that had I not had someone with me, I wouldnt have had to wait or go searching for anyone to help me reach anything either. Love the really wide aisles!! If the store had been busy I probably still wouldnt have felt like I was in the way of people or worrying about taking knuckles out to get passed others  .",
