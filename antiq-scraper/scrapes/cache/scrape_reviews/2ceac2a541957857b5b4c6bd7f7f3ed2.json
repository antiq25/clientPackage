We ordered: x3 Funky Chicken $16.95 (recommend) Cauli Sutra (Chickpea) $21.60 Buy 1 get 1 free (recommend) Pacific Prawn Star $16.90  (recommend) All 3 dishes were super tasty, fresh and well balanced! You get rice under the pickled veggies and salad, the chicken and prawns were juicy and warm still and give a nice middle eastern taste. In the whole bowl you pretty much get a little bit of everything, sweet from the pomegranates, savoury from the chicken, spicy from the jalapenos, tangy from the pickled veggies and a good balance of rice and that great wet sauce on top! Overall highly recommend trying this place out, you won t regret!",

            "review_text": "My wife and I recently had the pleasure of dining at a remarkable restaurant during our 10-day stay in Canada, and its safe to say that this dining experience was the highlight of our trip. This culinary gem, which we wholeheartedly recommend to all fellow food enthusiasts, is none other than the restaurant where we indulged in the freshest, healthiest, and most delectable dishes weve ever had the pleasure of savoring. The restaurants ambiance was cozy and welcoming, creating the perfect atmosphere for a memorable dining experience. However, what truly sets this place apart is its commitment to serving healthy yet incredibly delicious food. We were pleasantly surprised to discover an extensive menu filled with a variety of options to cater to various dietary preferences. As health-conscious individuals, we couldnt have been more delighted. One of the standout dishes we had the pleasure of trying was the Grizzlys Catch. This seafood masterpiece was a true culinary delight. The perfectly seared fish was tender, flaky, and bursting with flavor. The accompanying fresh vegetables and light drizzle of sauce complemented the dish perfectly, making it a must-try for any seafood lover. Another absolute winner was the Yogis Paradise. This vegetarian dish was a symphony of flavors and textures. The combination of perfectly grilled tofu, sauteed vegetables, and a mouthwatering sauce made this dish an explosion of taste in every bite. It was a pleasant surprise even for us, non-vegetarians, and it showcased the restaurants mastery in creating dishes that cater to all palates. One of the most remarkable aspects of our dining experience was the exceptional service provided by Chef Ankit. His passion for food was palpable, and he went above and beyond to ensure that we were not only well-fed but also educated about each dishs preparation. His detailed explanations and friendly demeanor added a personal touch to our meal, making it all the more special. In addition to the incredible food and service, we were also impressed by the restaurants commitment to using fresh, locally sourced ingredients. It was evident that quality and health were top priorities in every dish they prepared. Our journey in Canada would not have been complete without this culinary adventure, and for that, we are deeply grateful to Chef Ankit and the entire restaurant team. We wholeheartedly recommend this establishment to anyone visiting the area. Whether youre a health-conscious diner or simply in search of a fantastic meal, this restaurant is a must-visit. Thank you for making our trip truly memorable!",

            "review_text": "oh my GOODNESSSSSSS!!! (pun intended) I have stumbled upon my redemption.  The best most healthiest food in a bowl of Love. Found this weird little mall at the corner of Abbott and Keefer (Cineplex Odeon and the Catfe are there too)...thought Id check out their food court and see if there was anything up there that I SHOULD be eating...as opposed to what I HAVE been eating (Chocolate and Popcorn, lol) In front of me lies an unassuming little counter with a woman in the back cooking and prepping.  As I read through the crazy amount of healthy ingredients I can put into a bowl, I am relieved to have found them and cant wait to put my order together. It is Hard for me to cook for myself and I dont get all the variety or quality of food that my body needs.  This was fast food the right way.  Healthy and Organic. The woman behind the counter, Meet (who had already spent most of her day cooking and prepping all the delicious choices) helped me put together a custom bowl. With a base of cauli/quinoa/kale, I added beautiful chicken chunks and flavorful tofu, chickpeas, beetroot,spinach, brocolli, carrots, crunchy lentils and a very happy sauce to blend it all together. I am home now eating it and it is So Dang GOOD!!!  I have enough for 3 or 4 meals (got the large bowl).  And I know every meal will be nutritious, delicious and filling. The service was the best, I was made to feel so special! I am in the area for a month, and Ojas (and Meet) will be my new best friends. Color me Grate-ful!   :)",
