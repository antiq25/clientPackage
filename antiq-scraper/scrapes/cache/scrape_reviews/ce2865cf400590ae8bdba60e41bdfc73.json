            "review_text": "This establishment is unpretentious and needs no recomendations, but do not be disuaded by the store front s modesty. If you enjoy Malaysian food, specifically soup or stew with curry and coconut milk, then you will enjoy the flavours served here. Apart from base ingredients being ready, each bowl will be made to order. If you like it hot (spicy) they will be happy to comply and the same can be said for a milder palete. We ordered two; one bowl of chicken curry with noodles and another bowl of Laksa. The Chicken Curry was enriched with coconut milk and a red-curry broth with just the right amount of heat. I asked for hot   and it had a perfect kick to enjoy every drop! Every once in a while, a bite into a potato that had been stewing in the broth was a delight. The chicken was tender and sooooo full of flavour that I wanted more, but honestly I did not feel there wasn t enough, I just didn t want it to end, in fact the only time I felt sad was when I saw the bottom of the bowl. The Laksa with noodles, tasted like it was made with coconut and a spicy fish broth (slightly milder than the coconut curry). With large chunks of fried tofu, fish cake, shrimp, chicken and hard boiled egg, there was no shortage of mouth-party suprizes! Is it worth coming here? Why ask me? Just stand and watch the steady line of happy loyal customers who by their presence alone will testify to great food, good value and quick effecient service.",

            "review_text": "I ordered delivery at this place from Uber Eats. The dishes I ordered were Fried Kuey Teow and Vegetable Fritters. Food is affordable and tastes amazing! They dont cheap out on ingredients! Best of all, they gave me a receipt of the food! So if I enjoy the food, next time I can order the same dish! A lot of take outs Ive ordered dont provide that. They just write the persons name on the dish. A big difference in experience~ Fried Kuey Teow: I taste more sea food and veggies than noodles! They dont cheap out on ingredients! On top of that, they put the right amount of flavour in my opinion. Amazing would definitely order again! Vegetable Fritters: Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. For $1.85 they provide 2. The 2 vegetable fritters are big so definitely worth the price! Even tho it was weird they provided the food in a paper bag, I didnt mind it. Paper means eco friendly! Overall, a bang for your buck! I have never tried these foods before so this was a delight!",

We order laksa and char kway teow and they both tasted very authentic and similar to what you d get overseas at a hawker centre. The prices were very fair, both dishes less than $14. As far as drinks went, I wished they had 100Plus, as they only had the typical Canadian soft drinks.",

With the Chicken and Rice, the oil to rice ratio is pretty spot on, and the chicken is simple and done well. For the price you pay this is a steal after all these years.

Food here is as good as more expensive spots downtown. Their kway teow is my top pick. I have never recommended to someone and had them not love it. Veggie options are also diverse and delicious. Food can be a bit greasy, but at this place you won t mind it. Hawkers might look a little run down but it is always clean, the food comes quick, and the service is great.",

            "review_text": "Singaporean/ Malaysian cuisine like a hawker stall - One of my favourites for over a decade.  This place breaks the rule of cheap, fast and good- you can only pick two.  Unbelievably priced, fast service and the food is generous and delicious.  The seating area and ambiance is like a cafe, so I recommend doing take-away / take-out. Lamb curry, nasi goreng, hainan chicken, mee goreng, and some roti to go please! No need to advertise - they are busy busy busy. Try it.",
