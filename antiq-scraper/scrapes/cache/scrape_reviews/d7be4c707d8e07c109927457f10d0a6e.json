            "review_text": "We got an Airbnb down the street and found this to be the nearest restaurant,looked at the menu and even though we didn t have a reservation it was absolutely my lucky day that they were sweet to accommodate us on a 2-top table. Jose s service was great, even though it was a super busy night, but like in a good Italian restaurant I loved how we were not rushed and enjoyed our time. We hit yo try the crab tower, which I wouldn t have expected but flavor was incredible! One of the best Carpaccio s I ve ever had, being one of my favorite Italian dishes and have had in many places and countries! flavor was absolutely on point, antipasto was excellent in every bite, followed by a fantastic and light Gnocchi with white sauce. I wish we had space to try the creme brulee, but we did take a Tiramisu to go and didn t disappoint! Atmosphere was lovely, restaurant was beautiful! It truly made our night in Vancouver, wish we could come back tomorrow but it was fully booked as well. Thank you so much!",

Great setting, ambiance, the food presentation, waiters/waitress knowledge of the menu, and the owner walking around chatting with patrons.  Very cool. Light Italian music playing in the background, easy to have conversations and not feel like you are yelling.  Yet with a full restaurant, did not feel loud. Food was very tasteful and savory.  Each overseen by chefs and owner.  Fresh catches of the day were great.  You can tell the food was done by those knowledgeable of what they are making.",

I just love this restaurant.  Its kind of like a whose who in Vancouver ...older crowd but you know its a sophisticated but fun crowd. Our server Nicole was excellent . I told her how her knowledge of the menu was so appreciated and she helped us create the best dinner experience for our table . We started with fresh crisp breads and homemade breads made in house ( rye, sourdough and foccacia) all were delicious but the foccacia was pillows soft. We had the crab avocado tower which was on special , delish. Beet and burrata salad....very generous with the mouth watering burrata. The Caesar salad was super good too ...I would get then to chop up the romaine for u . Clam vongole incredible (so many clamssss) and then this other fancy pasta with like huge rigatoni style pasta with spicy sausage....Im drooling as I write this . Finally new year steak ...perfection . Desserts kill me now ....sorbet raspberry and pear were light and refreshing.  The warm chocolate cake was very good as well....overall was an amazing evening.  The atmosphere was just perfect, server was amazing, company was the best and the food was  .  Thank you again !!",

I also ordered their Calamari and then Cheesecake for dessert   yum From the wonderful service to the amazing chefs, dishes and environment this place is legendary. And oh, once it s nicer out book yourself a table in the outdoor villa area and it s just gorgeous outside. Cheers   to 2023 all!!",

Always drive by here and see fancy cars nearby and I knew this place is good lol Had the luck to sit in the backyard today (first day to have patio open this year), I felt like eating in Tuscany, it was really cozy and relaxing. The manager Bobby and our servers were excellent, top notch service. Pasta were fabulous, the veal ossobuco was beyond my expectation though it looked average! Lamb rack and halibut were savoury too. Tiramisu and gelato were excellent. Overall we enjoyed the dining experience. One thing I found it interesting is most of the patrons here are elder white people, I guess this is where the old money comes to indulge themselves.",

I couldn t choose between two pastas and had a split of fettuccine with parma prosciutto and petit pois in a light cream sauce, and paccheri di gragnano with spicy italian sausage, pecorino cheese. They were both flavourful and delicious. Our server was Andrew and he was very excellent and we really enjoyed our interaction with him. Look forward to going back.",

The outdoor seating is unparalleled in Vancouver. The indoor seating can be quite noisy at times. Great spot for celebrations, work dinners or date nights (or a I dont want to cook Wednesday). The pastas are delicious and half orders are available for the starter course. Veal chop is always a winner for a main",

We went with our two young daughters and were dazzled by the beautiful artwork and vibrant atmosphere. He explained the Italian menu and dumbed it down for us. The girls wanted spaghetti. When the food arrived it was first class service. The calamari the pasta the white fish and the lobster bisque were all perfect. Even our picky eaters ate all the spaghetti.

By far the best experience we ve had in Vancouver at a restaurant. The food and service was unbelievable but what blew us away was the girl working the appetizer station. She was so personable and made our experience 10/10. Not only did she make fantastic recommendations but we loved watching her zip around the kitchen. She was so fun to talk to and deserved every bit of the tip we gave her. Will definitely be coming back to sit at the kitchen bar table",

Personally, I love reading my writing, but I will take her words under advisement, and will keep this review a little more manageable. I was excited when I got to the restaurant a few minutes before my reservation. They took me to a little table with a great view of the kitchen. I so enjoy watching a professional kitchen work in the heat of dinner service. A few of their crew members seemed to remember me from the last time that I was there, and they had me feeling at ease and laughing out loud in no time. I decided to go with three of the specials which were described to me when I was ordering. I started with the shrimp salad.",

The service is also of the highest quality, with incredibly attentive and well-trained staff, a sommelier who has recommended excellent suggestions every time and it even has a few options for vegans though admittedly you will be limited to either one salad, one soup, or one of two pastas (all of which are fantastic). Also, got to meet the owner, Umberto, was a super nice guy.",

The lettuce with goat cheese beautifully combined the nippy taste of the goat cheese and the sweetness of the vinaigrette, the spaghetti carbonara had exactly the right amount of pancetta and egg. The wine list has an excellent choice of all-Italian bottles, and a good selection by the glass and even half-glass if you want to keep sipping but dont want to order a full glass.",
