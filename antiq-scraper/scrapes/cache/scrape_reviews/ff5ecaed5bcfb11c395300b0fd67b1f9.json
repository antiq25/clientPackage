I also have to comment on the prices. Its so affordable. Half the price of most places nowadays. A can of beer is 3.75! My burger (no sides) was 6.75. Unheard of these days! The service was fast and friendly. When I walked in I was the only customer but shortly after it filled up. Ill definitely be back when Im in the area!",

Came back today to satisfy a long waited craving of the absolute best burgers in town. They taste homemade and created with love and affection. I hear they have been around for a quarter century and I do not see them going anywhere soon, only expanding to distant lands. Thank you for making our day and tickling my taste buds while drooling during each bite. This is what a burger tastes like. If you live far away from one of their locations, make the trip down and you will not be disappointed. Ive read some of the negative reviews and they are bullshivic. The food experience speaks for itself. Even if they screwed up my order or the girl today was mean to me I would still come back for the food. Im not sure whats in their food but its messing with my dopamine uptake. It must the the love. Ps. Not sure what happened to my original post but hopefully this one is similar. Great job team. Youll be seeing more of me until I try everything. And yes, I have thanked my colleague, he is one special guy. Cheers.",

Ive decided to pick up lunch here after my usual go to was closed, and Im glad I made that decision. I was greeted by a kind Cashier in a storefront filled with grumbling impatient patrons waiting for their orders, her unwavering cheerful attitude was definitely the highlight of the whole experience and the wait wasnt terribly long (15 minutes). The place is usually packed during lunch time and while there is a big parking lot in the complex it gets quite busy making it difficult to navigate in and out. Their burgers were much more better than I had last remembered, not greasy and it had the home style charred flavour. Their Milkshake is still as top notch as ever. They are very generous with the fries, the amount that comes in one combo was enough for two people, the fries were very crunchy and not greasy at all. Definitely one of the better burger joints out there and definitely a must try milkshake place Ive always walked past this storefront but now I will definitely come back to fulfill my burger cravings",

The burger was packed with flavor and reminds me of the old Wally. The fries are not the old McCain fries which I personally like, but I dont blame them for switching to hand cut fries as majority of people like those better. The only drawback is the location. Tight and crowded parking welcomes you. The restaurant is tiny, but cute. I really just came to try the burger and it is didnt disappointed.",

If textures are your thing, than you came to the right place, I have no idea how they cook the fries, but they nailed it, soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside, the bun on the burger is soft and has an almost creamy feel in your mouth.

Burger was juicy and done to perfection.  Fries were crispy and tasty. Staff went overboard to correct a slight error in order.  Very customer oriented and the pricing is reasonable for the quality of the product.  Definately recommend a visit if you love burgers. 2018, Still a bit of the 50s atmosphere.  Tried the deluxe Wally burger special deal at two for $5.00.  As I love my burgers, nothing outstanding have had better.  Fries were well done crispy, not greasy.  Onion rings were done the way I like them as they too were crispy.  For the price its a good deal but not as outstanding as when they were on Kingsway.",

I could have had two, or combo ed it to fill up, but it was a great morsul that we will order, eat, enjoy and repeat in the near future; maybe next time with a good looking milkshake",

Not greasy, but a thin and crunchy batter.  My partner had the Chuck wagon burger that was huge, and we did share fries, because the portions are pretty substantial. Our meals arrived quickly, and everything was piping hot. The parking structure is large, but so busy. There was alot of Handicap parking available,  thoughout the lot. Im picky however about parking my car in the lot, as i do have a preference to dent free doors. Wallys is definitely Handicap accessible,  and they have table able to accommodate wheelchairs if needed. The staff were all very nice & presented themselves well. All were willing to engage in conversation with us, and when we left the restaurant we were bid farewell, and thanked for our business.",

            "review_text": "Awesome to find this gem. I had thought this place was permanently erased from my childhood when I had learned that the restaurant on kingsway was shutting its doors forever. I ordered 2 wally burgers and a chocolate milkshake and it had brought back memories of sitting outside of the original restaurant on a summers day on kingsway. I have to admit it was very close to what I had over 10 years ago. The bun was toasted nicely and had a generous amount of sauce. The onions felt like it hasnt changed at all. It still had that strong onion flavor with every bite I took. The seasoning felt pretty close to what I remembered. As for the milkshake, maybe the  old Asian woman that prepared it back then gave me an extra shot of chocolate or icecream, but the shake that was served was perfect enough. The staff are super friendly and the prices are reasonable. This location is located in a strip mall so parking is available and free. I knew that the food couldnt be duplicated from my childhood years but this came damn close and Im so glad to see its doors open again.",

            "review_text": "This is our review based on our visit Thursday, July 16, 2020 (order in person and take out). First, a shoutout to front staff and all the frontline workers braving their souls to deal with the public mass and risking their lives during this pandemic. As we continue on with the new normal and unfortunate spike during last week, it is expected that we all want transparency.  Do staff wear masks?  On my day of my order, no.  I was shocked the 2 staff members that I saw  at the back do not wear masks at all.  I understand that people now want to know if staff members are wearing masks or not (especially cooks) so here is your answer.  It doesnt affect my rating though.  But I sincerely would have hoped the cook staff would wear one though.  Also, I hope they would add on another plexiglass  for the front counter so the cashier wont have to be that exposed to outsiders for health and safety reasons. It only has half a side so when she takes your orders, she will still have be on the side with no plexiglass and I felt bad for her.  Again, it all comes back to safety at this day and time and when staff are safe and healthy, we are healthy (and vice versa).  Hopefully, they would move on to online ordering so we can order, pay online and pick up.  Otherwise, you will have to order in-person and take out.  The wait for your food isnt long either even when I was a part of a wait (customers ahead of me) so its just as fast as McDonalds.  As customers, I also notice other customers are socially distancing too (of course, you would get an  odd ball that seem to not know what is going on in the world and would try to be very close to you, SMH).   Otherwise, burgers are flavourful (not to a point where its so salty that you cant even eat it).  Onion rings are to die so you may want to order more.",
