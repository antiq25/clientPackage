I stayed in a suite at a high floor. It offered an unblocked view of the Vancouver suburbs, with minimal tall buildings blocking the view. Safety: Surrounding neighbourhood is safe. Walkability: Crystal Mall has a lot of Asian (specifically Chinese) shops and eateries. Metropolis at Metrotown is within walking distance and offers a huge selection of shopping (e.g. Walmart and Canadian Superstore). Food & drinks: Breakfast buffet service is available for a fee and the spread is decent, certainly on par with Hilton breakfasts.",

Location is super convenient next to the Skytrain (easy ride downtown) and malls/shopping. Price was a lot cheaper than staying downtown but still well located. Parking wasnt too bad for an urban area. Only complaint is one morning, I think they only had one elevator running, and we literally waited on our floor for an elevator for about 15 minutes (5 minutes for the first which was already full, then another 10 for the second which had room). But I think that was a short lived problem, the rest of the stay we didnt have any issues.",

The hotel itself is situated in a great town center with many different shopping centers surrounding it and malls within walking distance, as well as easy access to public transportation to get downtown. My only issue were the two days in a row of an unexpected wake up call of the fire alarms going off at 6:30am.

The hotel staff who brought up some extra towels were very kind and helpful. The room was a bit dusty, but that is completely okay as we did not need to reach those areas. The part that may have been a downside is the parking gates as one has to go around to make sure you are at the hotel gates as the other is for the mall which closes at a specific time. The front desk agent was very helpful when we called to make sure how to get back in. Our view was from the 12th floor, so it really had an amazing view and walking distance from Metropolis mall and connected to the Crystal Mall for convenience.",

The staff at this location were amazing, very kind and attentive.

However, it was a false alarmed fire evacuation that we have to give less stars due to the hotels lack of leadership and direction in helping guests to evacuate safely. My family had to stay in the middle of the fire escape stair well (in 12th Floor) to help a helpless handicapped person with no hotel personnel around to help him.  Our two teenage kids were finally able to help this person to safety on ground floor outside the front door. On a bright side, we would like to recognize one of the hotels reception hostesses, Ms. Chloe Duong, who has been very exemplary and went above and beyond her duties to offer us more guides & travel tips about your great city as well as pointing us to other Hilton facilities in Canada for our next travels.  She has represented Hilton well and we have been most impressed with her professionalism, poise, and cheerful positive attitude.  She has earned a 5/5 stars rating from us!

Hotel service was excellent at check-in and out. I didnt use any amenities, housekeeping or room service, so I cannot comment on those. They do provide a discount ($10 off) for the breakfast ($30) but I didnt use it nor did I go to the restaurant. The room was very clean and spacious. I had requested a king bed but received 2 queens (my work booked the room so not sure if there had been a communication-issue at that step). I liked the blackout curtains and found the room mostly quiet - you could hear the skytrain but not my neighbours. The AC/heating fan was loud but that just may be something they do to drown out any other possible noise. Overall, a very nice place to stay.",

I felt this Hilton hotel provided good value in comparison. And the Vancouver metro system is a very good way to get around for my needs. Although I have to say the car park was a bit confusing at first. Hotel has great rooms. Seems to be new. I liked the room facilities. Everything was great. Breakfast was nice. Service was good but can be iffy when it is super busy. One day I had to wait for coffee for a long time. Would be better if there is self service. The staff are running up and down as it was super busy. Club lounge is small, I dont know how they will be able to deal with the influx of guests when it is fully operational again. Overall a great hotel if you need to be in Vancouver area. Highly recommended.",

Liza is a true gem! Rooms felt recently renovated and we re cleaned and tidied daily, I had a 1 King 2 room suite thanks to being a Diamond. I did not experience the Buffet Breakfast as I left for work super early. Liza arranged a bagged breakfast that also exceeded expectations, I cannot be appreciative enough. Executive Lounge is currently opened for Coffee/Espresso Juice/Soft Drinks etc but was told it will be back to the Canape, Breakfast, and Alcohol previous offered soon! Will definitely stay here again",

Warm service, shoutout to Massimo, who was able to quickly resolve a duplicate reservation issue that I found out only a day before I arrived due to an issue with Hiltons (not the hotel itselfs) reservation system. The room was large and clean (although the lamps and the washroom felt a bit dated). The Hilton apps floor plan was very handy as I was able to choose a room with extra floor space with good views thanks to the buildings interesting shape and layout. The digital key also worked well. The location is excellent - an Asian food court is literally downstairs (has an amazing dim sum place) and very close to the SkyTrain station for a ride to downtown. I tried the hotels breakfast once and found it to be pleasant with friendly service from the breakfast room staff, albeit overpriced ($30) compared to similar hotels Ive stayed at so I didnt think it was worth having breakfast there twice. Overall would still highly recommend.",

One of the key reasons why this hotel does well is its staff, even accommodating my over sized truck by parking it in the loading zone area (for extra fee). With limited parking in the area, this was very beneficial with anyone driving in with large trucks. The breakfast was a step up compared to many other hotels I have stayed at. Coming to the hotel for business, Anthony (one of the managers) made sure my stay met all my needs and expectations, which is why I would recommend this hotel to many of my associates for business stays.",

The morning desk staff were equally friendly, and the hotel had a complimentary breakfast station set up because the adjoining restaurant is temporarily closed - like, thats going above and beyond. There are plenty of food places in walking distance, but they went out of the way to make things easier for guests. As we were leaving, a smiling custodian warned us about a coffee spill at the bottom of the escalator so we wouldnt step in it. Right down to the very last person we had contact with as we left, everyone was at that high level of customer care. I mean the rooms are great, but I needed to call out the awesome staff!",

When we first arrived, our room smelt a little off, we called down to the desk and  they moved us to a new room that smelt clean! They even came up to our floor and helped us move over. My only complaint, and this might be because I am not a resident of Vancouver. I dont think you should charge your guests for parking. Work it into your room prices or something. An extra $20 to park my car a night, was a little bit of a drag. Other hotels in your area supply free parking. Perhaps something to think about. Thank you again for the amazing stay though!",

The curtains covered the ENTIRE window and they even overlapped the tracks in the centre so not one annoying laser of light came through in the morning.  The door was placed around a corner so no sneaky hallway light either. No noise from the street.  None.  (In freakin METROTOWN!) The beds were perfect, the pillows a tad on the soft side for me as a side sleeper, but they worked. I have insomnia and chronic neck and shoulder pain.  I woke up rested and with a happy body. Sure, I could nitpick some other things about the hotel, but if like me actually sleeping is your #1 priority, this is the place.",

They were so kind to have accommodated to all my requests. All the staff including the housekeeping crew was super nice. They made me feel at home and always greeted my family with smiles. Everyone was great, I also want to thank Steve, Arif, Ben, Michael and Stephanie whom I gotten to meet. Great location. Great underground parking, very clean hotel. Pool was heated, the kids had a blast. The beds were super comfy and so was the queen sized sofa bed (quite surprising). Thank you, will sure to return in the future. Btw thank you for the welcome letter addresses to my kids, they were so happy!",

In that time we have gotten to know Stephanie and she is such a wonderful person. My father has stayed here as well on business other times and he always raves about the service and friendliness of everyone. Now it is February 2021 We arrived and needed a room. I can t remember her name (it started with a A). But she checked us in very quickly and efficiently. We were also given a room higher up with a view which was amazing. I asked for Stephanie and was told she was working tomorrow. The next morning we were delighted to have a COVID free breakfast and coffees. Thank you so much. Our purpose for this hotel stay was to purchase a vehicle. So that day we went out and bought a   SUV. As we were from out of town, we stayed another night. I got to talk to Stephanie that afternoon which was so nice, and we were given parking additionally for our new SUV which was great. What happened next was incredible.. We had bought a new set of winter tires and rims which were currently sitting inside our new vehicle in the underground parking. At about 10pm our phone in our hotel room rang and it was security. They were concerned for our new SUV and tires and they offered the loading locked garage to park it in for the night. I was happy to hear that they were watching out for us and so I went downstairs and moved our suv. This is something that was above and beyond what we asked for and it was incredible. Also to note that our room was extremely clean and we felt safe during our stay during this pandemic. That was very important to us. I can t rave enough about the Hilton metro town and thank you again for a wonderful stay. See you soon again hopefully!!!",

He took a special interest in us and was so sweet. The staff overall was very complimentary. The view was pretty from our room except for the construction site below. I would definitely come stay here again if Im ever in the area again.",

The restaurant which I used for breakfast and dinner a lot, had great service albeit the limited menus that hotels have. The front desk staff were very helpful about matters in the hotel and outside events to help me learn what was going on around town. Which outside and in close proximity is a huge ( Metrotown ) mall that has just about every type of store you could want. Lots of restaurants nearby also.  I enjoyed my stay tremendously.",

We had trouble with cards and coffee pot and the staff quickly and efficiently helped us out. The hotel is quiet and the beds are so great, the room was clean and spacious and black out curtains the bomb. Parking to front desk to staff at Starbucks to all of the staff we met was top notch. Location is fabulous for us visiting then hockey tourneys. Our favourite restaurants and the mall are within walking distance. Our suite had a small fridge to keep snacks cold. Soaker tub and nice shower head. No allergies at all for dusty rooms. Asked for a quiet room and they accommodated once again. You can t beat it for customer service and cleanliness. Roll away cots are big enough for adult or teen. King suite has plenty of room for cot and pull out queen sofa. Only things I could question is the lack of a fan in the bathroom and size of coffee the little maker puts out. Thankfully I could paddle downstairs in the am for a real grande cup of coffee. Pool was warm but small but for our daughter she was happy. Thanks Hilton for a great stay. Now to buy us some pillows.",

I was happy to find a hotel close, but far enough from my home in the suburbs that accommodates larger breed dogs. The location of the hotel was great because Central park was right there to take my little guy out for some exercise each morning, the Metrotown shopping centre was easily accessible as it is literally right across the street, and even though I stuck with the hotels room service menu there are plenty of quality restaurant nearby to indulge in. I was alittle disappointed I didnt get to stay in the room I originally paid for, which was a king bed with a view on one of the top floors, but was super grateful when they upgraded me to a suite on one of the lower pet-friendly floors. My little guy was pleased as well, since we had a few mini-games of fetch along the suites little hallway there. All staff encounters were pleasant and friendly, and I felt well taken care of. The rooms werent cheap, but they werent over the top expensive either, I definitely would recommend if you care more about quality then price. PS- Not a lot of choice for the true vegetarian, but if you still eat fish like me, I highly recommend their Wild BC Salmon and Quinoa salad for dinner, and their Smashed avocado for breakfast in the morning.",

Loved the mall than runs around the hotel. Public transit 5 min walk. Benjamin at the front desk and the bell hop whose name I didnt catch and all the hard working room service peeps. They were professional courteous and never seemed put out while working so hard.",
