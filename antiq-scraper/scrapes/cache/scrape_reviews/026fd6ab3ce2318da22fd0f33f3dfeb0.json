The servers were so hospitable, friendly and kind - I love it when servers have a smile on their face despite being crazy busy (which they were), and the food was absolutely incredible. The lamb shank and beef main dishes were so flavourful and the meat incredibly soft and delicious. We got some cocktails too and I was recommended an off the menu champagne that I drank like fruit juice. I really couldn t recommend this place more. Thanks for such a wonderful night!",

            "review_text": "The restaurant has a warm quiet ambiance. The quality of food is top notch. The restaurant space is medium size open floor with benches and tables on one side and a bar on the other. The kitchen is at the far end of the floor and visible from where you sit, so you can smell the food as it s being cooked. We tried Grilled Beef Ghalieh, Koofteh 18, and Chicken and Barberries and loved all three dishes. Grilled beef Ghalieh was like a stew with a savory sauce and a piece of tender beef short rib. The chicken was so tender. The koofteh tasted like classic nostalgic Iranian koofteh you d get at your grandma s. We were told if you d like to sit at the benches, you can leave a note when you re reserving your table if you have a preferred spot. We noted in our reservation our birthday occasion and they were nice to bring us a small cute baklava and a candle in the end. The place obviously has its own theme and is not like any other typical Persian restaurant. So if you re looking to get quantity food or kabob, this is not the right choice. But of you like to taste true Persian cuisine and experience Persian food with a contemporary style, this is absolutely the place. You can tell the owner cares about the cuisine the most. I read in the reviews that if you have a birthday cake, you can t eat it in the restaurant and it s mentioned in the website. So if you re planning a birthday and have a cake, you better review their policy or check in with them in advance. Overall we had a wonderful experience and we d like to come back when the menu changes so we can try their different dishes.",

            "review_text": "Update: On our recent trip to Vancouver, we just had to make time for dinner at Delara. Since our last visit, Delara has been listed by the Michelin Guide as one of its recommended restaurants. The food has gotten even better (which I didnt think possible) and the service has also improved even further. We started with the summer salad - it was bright and fresh. For drinks, we ordered doogh - just as great as our previous visits. For mains, we had the halibut with turmeric and dill sauce which comes with a side of bulgur and barberries. The cook on the halibut was perfection! We have had a lot of halibut over the last year (seems to feature on a lot of menus lately) and this iteration is without a doubt in my top 3. Just exquisite. We also had the fesenjoon with pan roasted duck breast. Fesenjoon is typically made with chicken throughout Iran but in the Caspian Sea region, it is traditionally served with duck. Every Iranian restaurant I have been to serves fesenjoon with chicken but I grew up eating it with duck, so this was a real treat! The cook on the duck was melt-in-your-mouth perfection. The sauce, sweet and tangy, was excellent. We also had tea with the turmeric and orange cake. A great dessert that really incorporates Iranian flavours without being too traditional. Delara continues to deliver! If you live in or near Vancouver, definitely check them out. If you plan on visiting the area, Id highly recommend making some time to stop at Delara! ----- A modern and fresh take on Iranian cuisine. A welcome departure from the typical kababi restaurants found in Vancouver and arguably the rest of Canada. Highly recommend the doogh - by far the best doogh Ive ever had! The Fesenjoon and Koofteh were fantastic. The chicken with barberry rice was also a hit! Delara offers a twist on traditional Iranian cuisine - if youre a purist, this might not be the place for you but Id encourage you to have an open mind and just give it a try!",

Let me tell you, both dishes were absolutely mind-blowing! The chicken sandwich came with fresh bread and a delightful minty white sauce, creating the perfect combination of flavors. However, the true star of the show was definitely the Fesenjoon! It was so rich and flavorful, I couldnt get enough of it. And to top it all off, we indulged in their heavenly chocolate and halva cake paired with a scoop of Earl Grey ice cream. It was the ultimate dessert experience.

            "review_text": "Delara Restaurant offers an impeccable journey through Persian gastronomy. Their menu is as much a testament to the rich heritage of Iranian cuisine as it is a testament to contemporary culinary innovation. Starting with the Koofteh, an opulent Persian starter, I was quickly transported to an aromatic bazaar. Each bite is a medley of flavor, perfectly balancing the robust spices without overpowering the tender, well-ground meat. The addition of barberries adds an unexpected yet delightful tanginess, providing a sophisticated contrast that left me craving the next bite. It s so good that I forgot to take a picture! The Lamb Shank is nothing short of a revelation. Slow-cooked to perfection, the meat falls off the bone with just the touch of a fork, melting effortlessly in the mouth. The succulent lamb, enhanced by a subtle infusion of rosemary and garlic, creates a depth of flavor that is both comforting and luxurious. The Fesenjoon Duck Breast takes center stage as a dazzling fusion dish. The duck, cooked to perfect tenderness, harmonizes with the pomegranate and walnut sauce in a captivating symphony of flavors. The dish holds a delightful surprise with every bite - the sweetness of the pomegranate, the earthiness of the walnuts, and the rich umami of the duck meld into a velvety, complex, and utterly unforgettable experience. Lastly, the dessert of Walnut, Date, and Honey Baklava is a crowning glory. This is not your run-of-the-mill baklava; this is a confection worthy of poetry. The thin, flaky pastry layers, interspersed with the nutty crunch of walnuts and the sweet chewiness of dates, come alive under a drizzle of honey. This baklava strikes a brilliant balance of sweetness without being cloying, and each bite is an indulgent pleasure. In all, Delara provides an exquisite culinary journey that captivates and delights. Their thoughtful use of traditional ingredients, skillful cooking techniques, and innovative flavor combinations ensure a memorable dining experience. Whether you re a fan of Persian cuisine or new to its charms, Delara is a destination worth visiting.",

            "review_text": "Lunch at Delara is just delightful! We had the Braised Lamb Shoulder Sandwich and the Roasted Chicken Leg and Barberries. Both dishes were so tasty that we ended up sharing half and half just so that we can eat both dishes each! The pulled lamb in the sandwich was so tender. The sourdough flatbread was actually very light and fluffy so it s not heavy on the stomach at all. The herbal notes makes this sandwich very light and yet delicious! The roasted chicken was tender and fragrant with the Barberry sauce. The accompanying saffron rice is delicious with a crusty layer on top. The herbed salad was so refreshing with the dill and mints in it. Drinks and wine menu offers quite a lot of choices. The rhubarb hibiscus sharbat was a bit too sweet but tasty nonetheless. This is our second time here and would go again any time we ll be in the area.",

            "review_text": "Ive been to many Persian restaurants. Many. The one thing most of them have in common is their disbelief in customer service. Many Persian restaurants that Ive been to all over the world...it seems to be a pattern that as long as they seat you, they bring you what you ordered and when done take your payment....then theyve done their job. Its really interesting, its almost as if the staff just walk around like theve been up for 12 hours straight trying to feed a newborn that just wont eat or sleep, and they just want it to end. This is pretty much the theme with most Persian restaurants. With this place the pattern that Ive seen so many times repeat itself was broken. Ill tell you how. Typical Persian restaurants: 1. No service 2. Depressing Persian music 3. Dated and Dusty decor 4. Bad lighting (if any) Now as for our experience at DELARA. When we first walked in right away the atmosphere was bright, modern, clean and shiny with a great smell....at the same time we were greeted by a warm welcome...like someone would into their home as if expecting a personal guest, and which is so characteristic of the Persian culture. I was so surprised, expecting the opposite, that I thought for a second that we were in the wrong place. The seating area, menu and table arrangements were contemporary, beautifully decorated with a fresh and tasty food selection. A new and fresh spin on Persian food. I was excited! Our waitress was so bubbly, friendly and attentive that it made the experience wonderful. She smiled. Yes, smiled! ....trust me thats not something you see very much in Persian restaurants. The food was fresh, creative and innovative and one thing I noticed that I have never noticed before in any restaurant ....Persian or otherwise, was that their food tasted homemade. Have you ever eaten out and the food tasted homemade? Yeah, me neither, that was the first time. Next time well be back for dinner, cant wait! :)",

Some of the best Persian food I have had authentic but presented in a more western style! Vegetarian/vegan options are a bit limited but available. The highlight for me was the  Chicken and Barberries  . Delicately flavoured with an amazing barberry/orange sauce. The others who had been here before told me the menu is tweaked fairly frequently   so when you do go back you get to try something different! To quote Delara -  Noosh e jaan May it be sweet for your soul! Would highly recommend this place   and will definitely go there again.",

With all my respect to other Persian restaurants, they are old class styles that you eat there with your family. Younger generations (like 20-40) enjoy modern styles these days. Eating in Delara, I had a flash back to my last meal in Iran. Having Persian core with western or French presentation is what we organically see in Iran and here at Delara. The food quality was great. The orange cake was fantastic. It brought happiness tears to my eyes as it absolutely tasted like what my grandpa used to bake. The staff were super friendly. We had a short chat with the chef/owner and he was friendly, as well. The restaurant design was very nostalgic, too. We loved our visit and it would be the place I will visit with my non-Persian friends to introduce Persian cuisine. Although, I will introduce other Persian restaurants to them as other styles of Persian food.",

This is the taste that you must try before you die  the cauliflower was soft and tasty and the good point was that it wasn t oily at all (maybe steam cooked).

This place is no traditional persian food place, and it doesnt need to be one. We have many traditional Iranian restaurants in North America. Some are one of the best in the world. Delara looks at the traditional Persian food and creates something new. You eat the food and drink the drink, you taste a childhood memory but you also tate the time you live in. I talked to the manager, and they worked hard on the menu and some of the best modernized persian food Ive tasted. This place sat in my heart during my short trip to Vancouver.  Highly recommended. I am going back to this place when I visit Vancouver again. BTW, that is a picture of Toot at the end If you lived in Iran, youd appreciate this in house made sweet. I havent had this for more than 20 years.",

Vegetarian options: Several vegetarian options, but many meat dishes would not be able to be made vegetarian.

The lunch menu is very limited with the Kookoo Sibzamini and the Chicken Kabob Sandwich the best of what we tried. The Marinated Smoked Olives were enjoyable and definitely very smokey. I wouldnt recommend the Beef Gheymeh as I found the lentils to overwhelm the beef making it unique but not as flavorful as the others. The Simorgh was an enjoyable cocktail although the circle ice cube fills a large portion of the glass.

The nostalgia of familiar spices took me back to my childhood in Tehran, but keep in mind, this is NOT your conventional Persian/ Iranian cuisine. Be ready to experience something new, I d say you should trust the chef. We came there as group, so we get to experience multiple dishes. My favourite was the salmon. The location is superb, the ambiance is warm and inviting, the cocktails are creative and refreshing. Add it to your list of  must visit .",

Ive heard a lot of good things and I finally decided to give it a try with a group of friends. The atmosphere and ambience was lovely. The choice of music which I think is very important was spot on, with loads of nostalgic classy Persian music. Our server Farzin went above and beyond to make sure we are comfortable and helped us with making decisions on drinks and food. The cocktails sounded very tasty and we got to try some. The pomegranate Margarita was my fave. I would 100% recommend this place for special occasions since its a bit on the pricy side.",

Both were outstanding and delicious. Both are a must try. For mains we had the beef and the Fesenjoon with duck breast. Duck and beef were perfectly cooked with beautifully spiced and flavoured sauces to accompany. For two people this was a lot of food so if you get a bunch of appies, you can definitely share one main. The sour cherry negroni and the Persian Godfather cocktails were both outstanding. I also tried the Cardamom Sharbat and the Doogh, both of which I had never tried before. They were certainly interesting and worth a try if you like to try new things, which I do. We didn t have room for dessert so we took the baklava home. It was good, but not as good as everything else. I would definitely love to try everything on their menu and go back for brunch. Service was great and decor and ambiance beautiful.",

Koofteh (Meatballs) also very delicious served with house made side bread. $$$ Prices are relatively high, and we almost paid $60 for just 1 dish and 1 starter.

For example, the Fesenjoon with duck instead of a more common chicken was succulent and fell off the bone. Surprisingly, the marinated smoked olives were a stand-out, as well. Ive eaten a great variety of olives across Europe and in the middle-east and these had an original flavour that I have never experienced. The service could use a bit of polish. Our server missed clearing our empty cocktail glasses and appetizer plates on two passes by our table.

We ordered the smoked rice and lentil bowl with the lamb sausage (an additional $5) and the braised lamb shoulder sandwich. The smoked rice and lentil bowl had a zesty salad with fresh herbs, tahini chili dressing, an egg, and nuts and seeds. I highly enjoyed this balanced meal and left me extremely satisfied! The braised lamb shoulder sandwich had really tender lamb and was really delicious. Not pictured was the spiced cardamom sharbat which was so refreshing and cold, especially helpful for a heatwave. For anyone thats in the area, Id definitely recommend you to check this place out!",

Everything we ate was perfection, the restaurant itself is modern while still keeping a lovely cultural touch. The first time we went was for brunch and I wish I wrote that review sooner because their brunch was also amazing. The service was fast and thoughtful. My picky Persian mom LOVED everything she ate. I ve noticed most of the reviews that are negative are from fellow Iranians, which makes me sad because it seems they are expecting it to be something it s not and it s unfair because truly, best Persian restaurant I ve been to in this city. It s been a long time coming for one of our restaurants to not just be kabobs. Kudos to the owner and we will be back!!!!",

The lamb shank, duck fesanjoon, sabzi, koofteh, and saffron-rice tahdig were all impeccably prepared and left nothing to be desired. Although the tahdig could have been a touch crunchier, the flavors were still delightful. The baklava and ice cream for dessert were a perfect end to the meal, satisfyingly sweet and enjoyable. Additionally, the selection of alcoholic beverages was impressive and complemented the dishes perfectly. The overall experience was outstanding, with excellent food, a cozy ambiance, and attentive service. It is different than other traditional Persian restaurant. In a better way with a better experience. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a memorable dining adventure.",

            "review_text": "One of the best Persian restaurants in town! Ive tried so many Persian restaurants in Vancouver, from the traditional to the modern one, but so far Delara is one of the best. We tried the fesenjan & zereshk polo (chicken and barbarry). Both were amazing, the duck is not fishy and the fesenjan was perfect. The zereshk polo was also amazing, but I wish we had a little bit more of the zereshk orange sauce for the chicken to make the chicken not too dry & to neutralize the dill flavor. But overall, it was amazing! We also tried the zeytoon parvardeh (smoke olives with pomegranate sauce) and saffron ice cream as well. The pomegranate sauce for the olives is amazing (very recommended to try!) and the cardamom cookies for the saffron ice cream was also AMAZING  . Lastly, dont forget to try the toot (marzipan candy) when they bring the bill for you. I didnt know about the candy before, but now Im addicted to it! Thanks for the great food and service!",
