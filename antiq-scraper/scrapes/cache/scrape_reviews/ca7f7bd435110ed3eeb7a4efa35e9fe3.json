I had a really good experience with Dr Mark Abbey, as a foreigner in Vancouver without my own Dr here it s always hit and miss with a walk in clinic.

Most other doctors make me feel rushed and I feel that the doctors here take the most time that they can with their patients, which seems to be a rarity here in Vancouver.

I was sick for weeks and couldnt breathe and was staying up all night with a rattle in my chest. Walked in to this clinic, was seen right away with no wait time at all, and explained my situation to the doctor. She didnt say much, which at first I thought was off-putting, but I quickly realised she was doing her job properly and professionally. She assessed me, told me I had bronchitis and that I had gotten much worse since the other Dr. at another clinic had misdiagnosed my symptoms. She quickly prescribed me some antibiotics and an inhaler to help clear my chest. I felt better within a couple of days. If not for her I fear I may have gotten much worse. 10/10 would recommend this clinic, as the staff are competent and understanding. They arent customer service representatives, they are health-care professionals, and thats what I want when I see a doctor.",

I don t need a doctor, I repeated several times. I just needed a tube for a self-administered test. They said I needed a requisition. I already have a requisition. They take it, grab a tube for me. Tell me I can t use their bathroom to do the self test, I would have to go somewhere else. I literally walk to the walk-in clinic next door who were more than happy to let me use their washroom to complete the test. I go to drop off the tube at LifeLabs, only to find they have given me the wrong tube. Great. EDIT: In response to the reply - new and training is one thing, but this receptionist was dismissive and patronizing. I had a simple request, and she made the interaction frustrating and I left in disbelief, unsure of what I had done to make her so angry with me.",

            "review_text": "I called in this morning to make an appointment for a botox consultation and the receptionist told me I had to come in right at that moment as there is no one waiting and they dont do appointments. Given that I work about 10 mins away, I arrived approx 20 mins after the phone call and had to wait another  8-10 mins while the receptionist was on the phone with no acknowledgement. After she took my ID and set me up, I asked  her how long it will take for someone to meet me and she tells me that the doctor has gone on break and wont be back for another at least 30 mins and that there is someone else in front of me. I have no issue waiting my turn and am not upset by this at all. That was completely fair, I saw the women ahead of me waiting before I got there. When I tell the receptionist that I was under the impression there was no wait given what she had told me on the phone, she told me that since the doctor saw no one was there, he went on break. I am not saying that the doctor does not deserve a break but at least schedule the breaks or close the clinic for the 30 mins - 1 hour that break takes place. I have seen many clinics use this method and it works best. My issue is not with the doctor but the incompetent receptionist, given my friends experience, I will come by again for a consultation and we will see if this is an overall staff problem.",

That one was basically went to the doctor with a problem, doctor gave useless advice to which I told him Id tried that for a week and I needed him to help he responded telling me I hadnt done it. Basically on go here if youre about to die and have no other options. The staff,  both reception and medical are awful and wont help with anything. The update was going to be I needed a form signed by a doctor, just a signature. Turns out this walk in clinic no longer has a doctor so its just a useless building with a rude receptionist wholl take all your details before telling you that theres no doctor and wont be for at least a month.

I loved the doctor I saw the first time, and have been back twice since. However, the receptionist ruins the experience and the way that the clinic runs makes it impossible to give this place a good rating. Their times listed are absolutely inaccurate. For example I was there today at 8:50am expecting the clinic to open at 9am. On the door they have no times posted, only online. The clinic finally opened at 9:30am. I walked in and the receptionist said they were not open for walk-ins as no doctors would be in today. I asked why that was not at least posted on the door, she replied theres nothing I can do. I told her that she could post something, even a piece of paper on the door with that information, or update their voicemail (of which they have none) Well at this point Ive taken the day off work, I still need to see a doctor, and all of the clinics are at least an hour wait time. I highly recommend staying away from this place.",
