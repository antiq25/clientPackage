The food and drinks were fantastic, everything youd expect from a quality Italian restaurant. We reserved the space by the bar and it was the perfect area for around 30 people (there is also a smaller private room available). The kitchen had no problem accommodating any dietary restrictions and volume of food. We ordered numerous Pizzas, Antipasti, Olives, and Meatballs. People liked how authentic the Pizzas were. The staff printed labels for the vegan food as well as custom printed drinks menus dotted around the tables. Very happy with the experience provided by all the staff. I look forward to eating there again!",

The service was warm and welcoming and the ambiance is elegant and cozy - perfect for a date or dinner party. I went with ppl who shared wine, but I myself don t drink, so I appreciated that they had some flavourful mocktail options on their cocktail list.",

We sat on the patio with our dog and they offered to bring out water right away, which was great. The food was excellent; we split the cacio e pepe and the potato pizza. Id highly recommend dining here. The one comment is that there were moments where the traffic was loud on the Kingsway, but 99% of the time the noise level was much better than I had expected and did not cause any issues.",

We started by sharing the pear-walnut salad. It was a good size with crisp greens, shredded pear and a nice walnut dressing. I had heard that the meatballs were really good, but we also wanted to try the panuozzo. So we settled on the meatball handheld. This was a huge!  It contained the aforementioned meatballs with arugula, fior de latte, Parmigiano with a fantastic housemade chili mayo. It was a bit messy to eat, but it was delicious! Highly recommended. Lastly, we had the potato and taleggio pizza. Dont let the chunks of garlic scare you.  They were confit, so the result was soft, creamy and sweet. Overall a very enjoyable lunch. Would definitely like to come back to try more!",

We ended up ordering our third pizza, Mushroom again. It was Mushrooms and Truffles heaven!!! I would give 5/5 for the Mushroom pizza but maybe a 4/5 for the Pepperoni one. We had Ferro Salad and warm olives as appetizers and I would order them again. We also got ourselves a cheese platter, but portion was not big for 5 of us. Overall I would go again and again. I definitely would crave the Mushroom Pizza. Wine comes in glass or 1L open bottles ( half a liter is available too). I feel like management need to think of extra help around the restaurant. It would take us 4-5 mins to find our host. Street Parking is available around the restaurant.",

            "review_text": "A really great Italian place on Kingsway, in the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood! I would actually recommend coming at lunch, so you can try the Panuozzo (handheld Italian sandwich, made with Verache Pizza Napoletana dough). We got the meatball panuozzo (with Calabrian chilli mayo, arugula, balsamic red onions, fior di latte, and parmigiano). Amazing flavour combination! And for pizza, we got the seasonal feature of Pepperoni & Spiced Honey (with tomato, fior di latte, fontina, Ezzo pepperoni, housemade spiced honey, and parmigiano). It mimics the New York-style pepperoni pizzas, and again, delicious. The dough for both the panuozzo and pizzas are incredible, great chew and not too thin or too thick. Pizza portions are reasonable, so can definitely order one per person, while sharing other dishes.",

The food is excellent and having the shared buffet in the larger space makes it perfect for mingling and socializing. The dedicated server we had that evening was so attentive and made sure the bills were in order, which was no small feat! Leading up to the event, the reservations crew were incredibly helpful and ensured the evening went well. Highly recommend Sprezzatura!
