Also their specialty dessert was a nougat ice cream cake with an almond sauce reduction (similar to a caramel). Their main dishes (The Burger, Lobster Ravioli and Seafood Paella) were all spectacular.",

It is such an interesting flavor between the honey roasted walnuts and the Gorgonzola cheese. The sweetness of the honey wasn t overpowering it just gave it a unique flavor at the end of the bite. I would 100% go back just for this pizza. The ambiance is so cozy and elegant yet funky inside. If it wasn t too hot, the patio would be a great option too, full of plants and it seemed like a spacious comfortable space. Vegetarian options: They had a couple vegetarian options on the menu, starting with avocado toast for brunch, some interesting appetizers like beet burrata, pasta options and pizza options. Of course, there are options of salads as well! The vegetarian here is happy",

The environment was actually stunning. It was tasteful, classy, chic and vibrant. Their bar is impressive and their food is creative and tasty. The Calamari was prepared the way Calamari is supposed to be prepared and unfortunately rarely is these days....but these guys got it down to a science. Fresh squid with the right proportion of batter, so the crisp accompanies the seafood and not the other way around. You taste the beautiful Squid with a light finish of batter paired with grilled jalapeno and two dips that were....well...bloody delicious. The Charred Chorizo with pita....what can I say about this beauty....just try it. Now for the Truffle Fries. Do you like Truffle fries? Well.....they serve the real ones here. Ive ordered them in several other places in Yaletown and they failed. They served me regular fries sprinkled some oregano on top, charged me for truffle fries and that was it. With these guys ..you get Truffle Fries. The service was impressive. We were always take care of on a Saturday evening. Cassie was great and we also had other staff being attentive, coming by and making sure all is well. Smiles, hard work, attention and appreciation with wonderful food and a bar that doesnt compromise. What else could you ask for on a Saturday evening out?! Will be back.",

The dough is incredible, the unique options they have for pizza are unparalleled, and the tapas selection ranges from hummus to carpaccio. Pizzas are cooked in authentic oven. They have many other options on the menu, so dont think you must have pizza, but it is hands down a solid choice. We went for lunch and ordered the Beef Carpaccio, and two pizzas - one called Criminale and the other called Carbonara. The Carbonara pizza tasted identical to the original pasta plate, but on a pizza. Magnificent. Environment and service were fantastic. Very attentive and professional servers. The atmosphere feels high-end with high ceilings and dark wooden beams holding bright bottles of liquor, or oil, or wine. Splendid to look at. Per Se is a MUST GO and Ill be back as soon as I can.",

Inside, the food is very good and the drinks are great. Weve been there a couple times when going to see shows or even if we just want a nice dinner out on the town. Very, very nice inside and the staff were great. If you have a nice dinner with friends or a decent size group, it would be a great place for that with a pretty decent range of food on the menu and lots of cocktails and wine.

The atmosphere inside in the evenings exceeded my expectations. With the diamond closing Ive been searching for another good cocktail bar and I feel like this place came out of nowhere.

The dishes me and my wife ordered were just delicious. The burger, the salad, the drinks, the dessert. Everything was amazing. Our waitress made sure our glasses of water were never empty. The atmosphere is also quite nice. Decoration is great, you can see the oven for the pizzas, and the music selection is nice but not loud enough to prevent from having conversation. The prices I consider them fair enough. Sure, I could get a hamburger for less than half the price, but Im not lying when I say its been the best burger Ive had in months (or maybe years). Overall, it was great and Id go again to try other dishes.",

We were served by the amazing Lana who was friendly, kind, helpful, and professional and because we were craving Salomon which was not an Entre in the menu she recommended for us what we now call  The Lana Salad  which was her recommended dish which consisted of mixed ingredients from two salads the Insalata Verde Di Casa with added ingredients and the sauce from the goat cheese salad. She made this recommendation based on preferences we expressed and the salad was so delicious and had such balanced flavours (finished the whole plate as you can see in the attached photos). Her hospitality was great and I will most definitely recommend this place to my friends and will definitely come back and hopefully be assisted by Lana again!",

It was a truly awesome experience. If youre looking for the best burger in town or the sweetest staff this is the spot to for you. We tried the charcuterie board, the burger and even some of the pizzas, and everything was not only delicious but also prepared quickly and customized to our required dietary restrictions. Grateful to have had the great bar manager Julia recommend The Burger which we got all dressed and was drool worthy. The rest of the staff members were super kind and even the owner was there and said hello. The overall ambiance of the place is FAB and couldnt have asked for anything more. Everyone went above and beyond with the service and the small details. Looking forward to coming back soon and enjoying another Perfect Pear cocktail and The Burger with crispy goat cheese. Dietary restrictions: All dietary restrictions were aided to, including vegetarian and shellfish. Parking: Parking available on the street for a small price. Wheelchair accessibility: The restaurant is very accessible and there are no stairs throughout.",

            "review_text": "I recently had the pleasure of trying the much-talked-about blue goose beef burger at this establishment, and I must say, it lived up to the hype. The flavors were exquisite, and the burger was crafted to perfection. While it may be a bit pricey, its definitely one of the best burgers Ive ever had. To round out my meal, I also ordered the tiramisu, which was decent but paled in comparison to the star of the show - the burger. Im already looking forward to returning for the brunch version of this burger, and I highly recommend giving it a try if youre a burger enthusiast. Update:  I went back to this spot and tried the brunch version of the blue goose beef burger, and I have to say, it was just as phenomenal as the original. The burger came with some changes in the type of bun and a few other ingredients, but the core of the dish remained intact, and it was just as delicious as I remembered. Its always a pleasure when a dish exceeds expectations, and this burger did just that. If you havent tried it yet, I highly recommend giving it a go.",

The vibe felt sophisticated but laid back, I really like the clusters of soft spherical lights, and the wines and alcohol lining the walls behind the bar. The burger I got was rich and beefy, but the tapas I got (chorizo sausage) was just ok. The service was great in the sense that my glass of water was getting filled up every 5 minutes, but personally I found it a bit distracting.",

            "review_text": "I finally had a chance to visit this restaurant. I did not have a reservation but the staff (Carter) was very professional and friendly in accommodating me and a friend for a business dinner. The ambiance is very welcoming and relaxing with good music in the background. It wasnt too loud as if you were in a nightclub, unlike many of the Vancouver restaurants going for the nightclub vibe these days. The ambience is suitable for business, casual, or romantic dining experience. We were served by Petr. He was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Hes happy to make recommendations based on your food preferences. For dinner, I had a Caesar salad along with a gourmet style hamburger. I must admit that was one of the best burgers Ive ever had. The beef is freshly ground in the kitchen, which is why they can offer to serve it rare to well done. Mine was a perfect medium. The hamburger exploded with the flavor of meat, sauce, truffles, and battered caramelized onions. It had just the right taste and crunch to it. The Caesar salad was tangy. Not at all fishy. For desserts we had the tiramisu. It wasnt too sweet. I didnt taste any of the alcohol, but Im not sure if it had any.  I would have liked to see a thicker ladyfinger layer on the bottom, but the flavours are just right. Highly recommended. Overall I had a great experience and I look forward to going back and try other menu items. Parking: Theres street parking available.",

Prince Poo has been here a few times before for business meals, always enjoying the lightly charred crust pizzas and tapas, but this review is on my own dime, so should be a little more objective ;) First, this is a premium priced establishment, but the value is definitely there. Staff are trained well.. they know how to treat their guests with friendly prompt service. Food was delicious. We enjoyed the rigatoni bolognese  rich wine infused flavours and pasta perfectly el dente. The seafood paella stole the show however, from the presentation, consistency of the rice, hint of charred flavour from the skillet, to the abundance of seafood.. it was awesome. Only critique would be the cocktail menu. While it boast many options, most in the $20+ range, very little caught my eye. I have no doubt they could make anything you asked for, but they seem to be lacking for those craving bourbon/rye/whiskey type drinks off the menu. Overall, a fantastic date night for Prince and his wife.. will come back again.",

We enjoyed a lot. Staff was so kind and the service was perfect. I highly recommend it for a delicious and comfy experience.",

Our waiter was knowledgeable, kind and patient and explained the menu for my dietary restrictions. I can t eat gluten or dairy and they had options and accommodations for that. Their gluten free in-house made bread is the best I ve had, we had it with the hummus as a tapa. Portions are generous. Music plays in the background at a low volume, quite comfortable environment, of course the busier it gets the louder it gets but the high ceilings and amount space helps a lot in terms of noise levels. They have the best spirits, carrying very well-known brands and types of tequila (Gin and others), they have the Whistler Forager gluten free beer. Vegetarian options: They had a good number of vegetarian options, all labelled in the menu and delicious looking. Dietary restrictions: There were accommodations for gluten and dairy free diets. They carry the Whistler Forager gluten free beer.",

Beautiful room,  great decorating, big windows.  Nice. My guest has food allergies,  staff were very attentive to our restrictions and gave us great confidence. Ordered the Crab Lobster Ravioli:  Delicious.  Nice thin pasta stuffed full of crab/lobster, the crustaceans were the star here. Covered in a rich mildly spicy sauce that didnt overwhelm. Yummy if unattractive dish. Next the Seafood Paella.  The real deal: saffron, bell peppers, lots of seafood, in a real iron Paella pan.  Missing the Socarrat, for most of the pan,  but I didnt mind much.  This was a delicious dish.  We left not a single grain of rice uneaten... With a Cappuccino it was $100 all in for two, good value for a treat lunch. So: Great room, elegant/informed service, delicious food. Would be a great date restaurant, so my next guest is my wife...shell love it.",

Im going to be thinking about it for a while - it was so juicy, came with a mouth watering onion jam, cheese, and an egg (cause its a brunch burger!). The meat was made to order - I got it done medium, it was perfect. The fries are really good here as well. Honestly, the only better burger Ive had was at Gordon Ramsay Burger in LV. I wish I came later in the day, cause I would have explored their cocktails more. I got the Jalapeno Smoke, it hit all the notes - sweet, a bit savoury, salty, and spicy. Totally loved it!",

Our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful. Unfortunately I don t remember her name. My boyfriend loves to ask questions when we dine and she was able to answer any questions he had.

The amount of detail, care and passion that went into designing the space and crafting the food and drink menu is evident and makes it stand out from other places in the city. Shoutout to the amazing team for all their hard work and for making everyone feel cared for and safe during these crazy COVID times!

            "review_text": "I m writing this review after 5 times trying Social Corner s food. Located in the heart of downtown Vancouver, Social Corner is a well-decorated Italian cafe and restaurant. It also holds a nice patio with many Jasmine and Petunia flowers in spring and summer. What I find unique for this restaurant are its brick pizza oven, in-house Arabica beans coffee brand (Ciclo), home-made pastries and cookies, and Rosalinda Spanish bar. The food is different in this restaurant as much like its establishment and decoration. You can order anything and waiting for something delicious and different. My suggestions: Definitely, check the pizzas and it doesn t matter which one. The bread is made from a 36-hour fermented dough and finally made in a pizza oven. You ll love the pizza. For brunch, order Carbonara and for lunch, order Funghi (really amazing). Avocado and sourdough (brunch menu) could be your favorite with the option of adding poached eggs. Salad are generally good. I recommend Seafood Paella as a huge and rich portion with a fantastic taste. The coffee is above average, yet its something personal and depends on your taste. Most of te time the staff are professional and everything goes smooth. Out of many times, we just experienced a new server who was not perfect, yet high staff turnover is normal especially during Covid. Update: Spanish breakfast is good to try. Brunch Bravas is not good as a portion as its served with a lot of potatoes and one egg which is not as attractive as other options. Enjoy!",

From their salads, to pizza, pasta, and THE burger. Wow wow wow! I also really like their pizzas and pasta specifically because they use san marzano tomatoes in their sauces. The pizza with the chili infused honey is to die for. Their sangria and cocktails are also fantastic. Service is always great. One of my favourite spots in the city when I want quality & tasty food. Atmosphere is great too and decor.",

For food I got the special of the day which was the mushroom and truffle ravioli. It was unbelievable! My husband got the burger which I took a bite of and was absolutely worth the hype. It is an incredible gourmet burger!! The service alone was a reason to keep going back. The server Liz was super great with recommendations. She even had her manager step in when we couldnt decide on a bottle of wine. He ended up recommending a wine that has definitely gone to the top of my list as a new favorite, the Pascal Jolivet Sancerre. Just an end to end great experience! Definitely going back and looking forward to their new location opening closer to me in Coal Harbour!!",
