To be honest it s a little bit expensive to me as a student, but the food and its taste is definitely worth the price. The fish is fresh and tartar sauce is delicious and flavorful I m so into it after the first taste.  I will probably pay Fish Cafe a second visit.",

            "review_text": "Was running errand in the area. We actually waited over 30 minutes for them to open, it was well worth it! We got 3pcs snapper fish&chips! Good portion! The batter was crispy, fish was moist, perfectly seasoned! It was soooooo good, really hit the spot! Tartar sauce was light and refreshing, not heavy at all. I craved this again 3-4 times that same day, I m still thinking about it today! We also got the scallop, grilled, over rice, with garlic butter! Scallop was also perfectly cooked! Sweet and juicy! I enjoyed dipping the scallop in the butter and adding tartar sauce to the rice for the perfect bite! Food was a little slow but we went right when they open so it was understandable. I appreciate that the chef take his time to prepare the food properly instead of rushing them out. Service was friendly and casual, very warm and welcoming! We enjoyed our conversation with them and our time there. This was also the first time we took our puppy to a restaurant, we were glad it was a pleasant experience. Their supplies came late that day and we couldn t order what we originally wanted, but we would definitely be back for other dishes. What we ended up ordering turn out great though, so no complain there! But next time we want to try cod fish& chips, grilled calamari, and clam chowder. :) We wish they have deep fried oysters too, I think it will be amazing!",

            "review_text": "Fish Cafe was great! Im from Toronto and my cousin mentioned BC has great seafood, its fresh. We started with the grilled calamari with garlic butter which was a great combo. I had a Greek salad with 1pc fish and chips. He had the grilled salmon on rice. For dessert we tried their chocolate cake (they didnt have anymore carrot cake). Its understandable that some menu items wouldnt be available due to the freshness of the food so we didnt get a chance to try their crab cakes or clam chowder. I would highly recommend the fish and chips, the snapper was very light and battered perfectly. Overall Im happy we visited and I would definitely go back if I visit BC again :) Parking: You may find free street parking if youre willing to park around the corner. Otherwise there is paid parking right in front of the restaurant.",

            "review_text": "I absolutely love this place. This is the type of place you see in movies where the small local fish restaurant has one chef and two waitresses who know the local patrons by name and their usual orders. My favorite dish on the menu is their fish burger. If you re a fan of blackened fish or focaccia bread this menu item is for you. I ve had both the salmon and red snapper options and I ve been impressed every time. The fish is always cooked to perfection and the focaccia bread *chef kiss* The fries are also always crispy and fresh which just competes the dish. Make sure to get some of their tarter sauce on side because it s the perfect blend of creamy and tart. I will note that the typical wait time for your food to be served feels a bit longer than most restaurants but when you re served amazing food, the wait time doesn t matter. Order a drink and enjoy the company around you.",

Well, it was amazing! Blackened with that garlic butter...just simply awesome. The grilled calamari, scallops, and prawns were equally fresh and delicious and those fries were among the best I have had. I would recommend the fries over the rice, only because they are so good!

Weve been coming here on at least a weekly basis for years and the quality has never dipped once.  The fish soup is sublime, with large chunks of fish every time.  My mother loves their fish and chips using cod; the fish is always moist and the batter is crunchy and light.  Even the fries are amazing.  Its worth pointing out that the fish and chips is cheaper here than at the White Spot and clearly on a completely different level.  I love the grilled trout and its never overcooked or dry, despite being such a thin, delicate piece of fish.  Portion sizes are always generous.  This is a comfortable neighbourhood spot, with really friendly and professional service.  Thanks to Marcus, his family and the staff for always making us feel welcome and VERY well fed.",

They offer two soups on their a la carte menu, namely a fish soup and a clam chowder. It was packed when I got there at seven.  The waitress has an excellent memory of the drink order of the restaurant most loyal customers.  The clam chowder was very good.  The swordfish was most enjoyable.  As for their wine selection, it is very limited.  In fact, if one wants serious cocktails, go to Barra 41 at Balsam and 41st Ave.",
