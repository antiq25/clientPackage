We treated ourselves to the Valentines Day box and everything arrived fresh and with clear instructions. Weve been to Spain so this meal brought back so many memories of the excellent food there. The Basque style cheesecake was worth it alone but honestly everything was delicious. The delivery arrived on time and with a smile. We even received a text in advance so we could be sure to be home. The rose in the box was a nice and unexpected touch. Would absolutely recommend El Mercat.",

As a Spaniard its really hard to find authentic Spanish cuisine as there are some other options but they are quite different from Spanish food, but El Mercar really exceeded my expectations. The quality of the food, the flavour and even the presentation and delivery was amazing, very friendly stuff and Its great that the chef himself comes to your home to deliver your food. I highly recommend El Mercat for those who want to experience THE REAL SPAIN.",

Then the Tuna Empanadas  appeared yummy . The quality of the food is so good , the service and the unbeatable attention Chef Sanz is awesome. Congratulations well done. Salud !!",
