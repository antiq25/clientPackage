I have visited most Petsmarts in the lower mainland and I often saw little hamsters and mice running on wheels that are not only dirty but also way too small for them (it would hurt their spines). And they often lived in smelly cages (pee soaked bedding) and having only pellets (no nutrients) for food. But this Petsmart in North Vancouver provide their rodents with proper size(bigger) and clean wheels to run on, their beddings are clean, and they even give them a variety of fresh vegetables for snacks alongside pellets! I saw happy and healthy  mice exercising on the wheels and comfortably cuddling with each other today. They were so comfortable with humans(thanks to the kind people who take good care of them) they would come out and curiously sniff us. I m so happy for the animals to be taken such good care of. Thank you guys so much NV Petsmart!",
