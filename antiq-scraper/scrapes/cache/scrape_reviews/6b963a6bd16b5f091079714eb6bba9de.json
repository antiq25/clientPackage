Food was yummy, Ive not had pho for a while and I really enjoyed it. The avocado salad was also good. The atmosphere was interesting similar to maybe a sports bar. Lots of great food options and good service. We will be back for sure.",

            "review_text": "Simply Delicious Restaurant & Bar is an absolute gem that left me glowing with joy after my visit. The moment I stepped inside, I was transported to a world that reminded me of the vibrant atmosphere depicted in the movie Coyote Ugly. The energetic ambiance and the presence of the attentive and empathetic servers truly made me feel like I was among Simply Delicious Angels, who could effortlessly grace the cover of any fashion magazine. From the very beginning, my experience at Simply Delicious exceeded my expectations. I decided to start with their oysters, and oh boy, they were a true delight! Fresh, succulent, and bursting with flavor, each bite was a reminder of the exceptional quality of their seafood. Accompanying the oysters was a generous portion of edamame, which was not only delicious but also served in a quantity that left me feeling satisfied. As a fan of classic cocktails, I couldnt resist ordering an Old Fashioned. To my surprise, despite the bartenders mentioning it was their first time making it, the drink was nothing short of perfection. The balance of flavors, the careful attention to detail, and the impeccable execution were indicative of the exceptional skill and talent present in the bar staff. However, it was not just the outstanding food and drinks that impressed me at Simply Delicious; it was the extraordinary service that truly stole the show. When I arrived, I was feeling down after a challenging day, having lost my job. Yet, the staff, especially two individuals named Yeeun and Julie, went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and cared for. Their warmth, friendliness, and genuine empathy turned my mood around completely. By the end of my visit to Simply Delicious, I left with a renewed sense of happiness. What started as a simple need for a drink turned into an experience that exceeded all my expectations. The exceptional quality of the food, the flawless execution of the drinks, and the remarkable service from the staff created a perfect storm of satisfaction and contentment. If youre looking for a place to lift your spirits and indulge in culinary delights, Simply Delicious Restaurant & Bar is the place to be. Its a haven where the food is exceptional, the service is extraordinary, and the atmosphere transports you to a world of joy. Trust me when I say that a visit to Simply Delicious will leave you with a smile on your face and a heart full of happiness.",

She makes an effort to meet all her customers when she is there. I met her on our first visit to the place and she has been a delight everytime we have been there. Her team is as fantastic as she is. Even on a busy game day like today,i noticed she made an effor to go to each table and speak to her guests. She is amazing,her team is amazing, this place is fantastic. If you are in Vancouver, you MUST visit here!! Thank you Simply Delicious team and Silvia for making my every visit more special than the last.",

I ordered almost everything on the menu and my favorite is the chicken fried rice because its taste brought back fond memories of my travels in Asia, its that good. I hope they add more selections of Nigiri combos in the future, thatd be cool. Give Simply Delicious a try, its simply delicious!",
