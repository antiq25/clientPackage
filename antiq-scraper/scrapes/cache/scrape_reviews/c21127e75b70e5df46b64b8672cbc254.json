            "review_text": "Hands down, best fish and chips Ive ever had in my life. We got the halibut and chips - fish tasted so fresh, was flaky in the inside and had a great exterior crunch. I must say though, the chips (i.e. fries), was the star of the dish for me - they were cooked to perfection. Crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, every single one of them. Service was quick and the patio atmosphere with a good view just makes this place that much better. Its about a 5min walk from Granville Island. 10000000% would recommend this place to anyone that loves good food.",

No indoor or covered seating. We tried the Cod fish and chips. Excellent batter and the fries were delicious. Tatar sauce was rich and satisfying. Coleslaw was underwhelming and slightly boring. We also had the Oyster  Po Boy  sandwich. The flavour was amazing and unique. Highly recommend. Overall, great service and exciting sandwich menu. Fish and chips were above par. I wished there were some covered seating as you re completely exposed to the elements. Of note: walking distance to Granville Island! Also, expect to wait to be served during peak hours.",

            "review_text": "This food stand near Fishermens Wharf has standard fish and chips with 3 fish options and other seafood creations like sandwiches and tacones. I had never tried oysters before but was feeling adventurous when I came and ordered the oyster po boy. I obviously wouldnt have known what oysters are supposed to be like, but I thought these were really good, and the sandwich as a whole was awesome. The grilled onions and chipotle sauce were really tasty with the oysters. The side of coleslaw was nice and crisp, and I always love coleslaw so I was happy this was included. The prices have gone up since the most recent menu pictures were uploaded online, but theyre still pretty reasonable for the times. My sandwich was $16. Theres a small, partially covered seating area to enjoy your food. It was raining while I was there and everyone was packing in to stay dry, but it wasnt unpleasant - it kind of added to the experience. Even in the rain, the setting by the water and fish market is perfect - this is how seafood is meant to be eaten! And although service may not be the most important thing at a counter-service place like this, the person who took my order was pleasant and made me feel welcome even with our short exchange. Vegetarian options: Everything contains seafood. Nothing vegetarian.",

The ratio of batter to fish is dominated by the meaty fish but the thin crisp outer layer works well in taste balance. Meals start from $11-> $24 depending on portion and which fish choice. Must go when in the area. Parking: Very limited parking",

The fish and chips where regular fish and chips but the fish (cod) was extremely flaky which made it so soft to eat. I would definitely get the fish and chips as the value of this dish is better than the salmon sandwich.",

Hurricane Katrina could be going on and I wouldn t even notice cause I would be too engulfed in my delicious fish & chips and curry soup. The staff are SO friendly, and hilarious! The food is amazing, consistent, and delightful. The Halibut is to die for, and the chips are fried to perfection. The oyster Po boy is also amazing! Honestly, I ve never had anything from here that didn t make me melt in my seat from sheer joy and sensory overload.",

There is a 20 min wait in line to order already, and by the time we ordered, the wait for the food is about 20 min.  The folks working there were friendly, and shouted out the long wait time to everyone so they know what to expect.  Didn t see anyone leave though. Very simple Menu, Cod, Salmon, or Halibut and Chips, along with a Salmon  Taco  or wrap.  The daily special was a Tuna wrap, along with a red curry soup. We ordered a bit of everything, and everything was good!  The fried cod and Salmon had a crunchy batter, and the fish was very fresh.  The fish was served on a bamboo basket filled with fresh fries that were crunchy, and a really big serving.  The tar tar sauce and the slaw was very good too, but the cod was really good with ketchup as well. The tuna wrap was tasty, the flavors were very balanced, and enhanced the freshness and sweetness of the tuna. All in all, we ate too much, but we will be going back.  The long lines were longer when we were done, but folks were waiting patiently for it.",

And it s interesting to go eat there in the winter and eat outside in the chilli brisk cool ocean air. You cannot beat the view with a backdrop of the city Granville Island and all the fishing boats. The food is fresh and at times in limited quantities. This place serves exactly what you would expect battered cod or salmon or any of the other seafood they sell to be. The service can be a little annoying only because there s so many tourists in front of you who don t know how to read a menu. Or ask to many questions And delay the line. Outdoor seating is probably for 50. But you can easily sit on the seawall and enjoy your snack. Beware of the birds they might steal your meal when you re not looking. My photos of the fish tacos. They were pretty good. Not enough for an entire meal. But a great snack while walking along the seawall.",

Fish done perfectly (fluffy and almost creamy texture) with a great batter, and fries are also just an amazing crisp and you can just tell that they use quality potatoes! Amazing service! The cashier was outstandingly friendly! Theyre doing takeout only (patio closed) because of COVID, but there are plenty of places nearby to chow down Im definitely going to come back to this place and tell all my friends about it. I heard that theres usually a wait, but we were lucky to beat the line at about 5:45pm on a Wednesday A true 10/10 experience",
