After shopped there once, I received a handwritten greeting card from Andy. During pandemic, Andy also sent wishing well emails. I could also stay home and buy from him. He was very patiently showing me the products through emails and texts. Andy also checked the products carefully before shipping them to me. You can also buy Gucci mens wear from him too. Strongly recommend!",

            "review_text": "I bought Gucci Ophidia cross body mens bag 2 months ago and used only 3 times carefully, however quality is so bad that leather just flaked out and when I went to boutique to ask for service and confirm me for price, they took my bag and confirmed to reach me to check service charges confirmation in a week or two and its been a month with no feedback and when I called store they say status on the system shows  Waiting for customer feedback  and no one ever reached out to me. So the lady on the call confirmed to write email to the boutique to call me and its been two days no one reached out to me still. So pathetic quality product and above the pathetic customer service. The audacity of this brand I tell you. I recommend Gucci brand to please learn some quality and customer service from  Coach  I bought few bags from them and they have amazing customer service and quality. They even remember my name everytime I walkin and makes me feel welcome and above everything quality of product is just amazing. I will go to the boutique and take my bag and never ever buy gucci again.",

She is doesn t know how to communicate and also provide me wrong product information, which is very nonprofessional. And also more than helping me she was busy talking to other advisors. I have visited this gucci store multiple times and her behaviour is always the same. I really hope the store manager gets to know about all this. I felt she is a bit old to work for a customer advisor. honestly speaking her behaviour was not tolerable at all. I am planning to report a file to gucci headquarters.

They only attended asian customers, even attended an asian man who sat and waited for hisfriend to buy something but not us. This is not acceptable by a store such as gucci.
