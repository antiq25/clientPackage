            "review_text": "We had our wedding reception brunch of about 60 people in the Skyline Room at Seasons in the Park restaurant in early August of 2023, and we were blown away by the outstanding service at our wedding! The food was delicious, the portions were generous, and the restaurant was more than happy to accommodate a few of our guests who had dietary restrictions. The service was fast, and the communication with us was incredible. So many of our guests also complimented the excellent service they received during our reception, and we had so many compliments about the beautiful view of Vancouver as well. The servers even went out of their way to ensure that we, the bride and groom, were comfortable and well taken care of during the entire brunch. Even the preplanning was smooth and seamless, and communicating back and forth with Makda about wedding details was an easy process. Many of our guests have commented that this was one of the best weddings theyve been to, and we could not have done it without all the wonderful help provided by Seasons. As a wedding venue, we highly recommend Seasons in the Park! Plus, we felt compared to other wedding venues, that Seasons was quite reasonable, and who can beat that beautiful view of Vancouver, and wonderful setting within Queen Elizabeth Park. Thank you very much Seasons for making our special day so wonderful!",

The cake was quite substantial and rich.  The creme brulee had hints of citrus in it. The mushroom soup was lacking a bit tho.  A bit bland, had to add some more salt and pepper to it myself but couldnt really help it. Service was very good and the views are amazing on the patio.",

Neither of us had been here before and we were both very impressed with the views, food and the service. Our server was amazing and insisted to take photos of us during the sunset, which was such a nice touch to the experience. We will definitely be coming back here again in the future.

One of my best meals and service experiences in Vancouver. The atmosphere, maturity of the servers, comfort of seating, views and delicious meals make it one of the best for sure. Our server Matthew was perfect in every way, and spot on with recommendations. Sure made for a wonderful experience. His suggestion to have the pork chop was spot on and truly perfectly cooked and served. Absolutely delicious. And other meals just as good. Perfect flavours and presentation. All round service support was also fantastic. Will surely be back for Prime Rib Sunday! An absolutely great dinner and perfect for spoiling mom on Mother s Day.",

We were seated at a perfect table with a great view to share with our nephew and partner visiting us from Denmark. The Caesar Salad was very good, fresh and lightly dressed and the Carpaccio was wonderful. The prime ribs were very good all around although mine needed a little more time on the grill for my liking but they accommodated me without fuss. We were too full for dessert so we just had Cuppacinos for all. It was a very enjoyable dinner and the service was great. Cant go wrong.",

The main thing about this restaurant is the views. As everyone has probably mentioned in all their reviews, but that scenery you get is astonishing. Your at the highest point in the city and as a reward, you get to see the mountains, Vancouver downtown, and all the greenery. The food was pretty good. We got the Lois Lake Steelhead Salmon, Wood Grill Chicken, and Lobster Tail. The service was good. The waiter was very nice and professional. The prices werent super expensive. They were quite reasonable and similar to other restaurants. I would definitely go back again and recommend.",

After exploring the Bloedel Conservatory & Queen Elizabeth Park, my touristy group of eight (8) walked to the nearby Seasons in the Park restaurant for drinks & dinner. I enjoyed the Lois Lake Steelhead Salmon (grilled salmon glazed with lemon-caper butter sauce and served on a bed of coconut rice with asparagus & carrots). For dessert, the Raspberry Cheesecake was perfectly sweet and light. And our hardworking server, Bela, was professional and attentive. Afterwards, my group of eight raved about their meals and this memorable dining experience.",

We ve dined here many times for celebrations, usually graduations. It s always been decent but again, a bit overpriced. We went for Saturday brunch today and it really surprised us! We just walked in around 11, they have tons of unreserved patio seating. We got a beautiful table overlooking the city. And when we saw the menu we realized the brunch prices are incredibly reasonable. All of us thoroughly enjoyed our food. Salmon burger was awesome. Smoked salmon benny was seasoned to perfection. Everything was hot. Then to top it all off our server brought a free cake out for my grandma s birthday. Absolutely amazing experience. Our server was so professional and warm without being overbearing. Plus she took some amazing photos of us! Thank you to the team at Seasons! We will be back and not only for celebrations because the brunch prices are so reasonable!",

We had a choice of outside or inside we chose outside but being  a bit chilly we were able to move inside with no hesitation from the staff. The menus are not complicated but refined with excellent selection. We each had one their select cocktails Spicy Mango and New York Sour then crab cake to share. We ordered the lamb and halibut. We like to share so again no hesitation as they brought us extra plates   The two dishes complimented each other nicely. Our server helped in a wine selection and brought us a dessert for our special occasion. Overall great location, wonderful service and good food Parking: Metered parking",

The service at Seasons was excellent. The staff were professional; attentive to our needs and very polite. The food simply could not have been more delicious. The dining experience was a 10/10.  I am most grateful for all that the staff did to make our celebration one to remember. Thank you Seasons!  Victoria Campbell",

I knew I couldnt request a window or patio specifically as its first come first serve, but I asked anyways in my reservation online in the notes. Just in case. We were greeted at the front with both hostesses saying happy birthday to him, and they put us in the most beautiful spot imaginable! With the most gorgeous view! I mean honestly all spots in there are amazing with views but ours was the best I think! We had absolutely wonderful service from Peter who was funny and very professional. And the food and wine was outstanding! I highly recommend this place for any occasion. And will absolutely come back! Also it was funny because every table in there seemed to be celebrating birthdays so its definitely a special spot that people take loved ones, and I see why! Thank you Peter and thank you everyone at Seasons!",

We had mussels, truffle fries, squid and prawns, duck confit, pork chops, halibut, spaghetti, seafood carbonara, rack of lamb, steelhead salmon and chicken fingers for the kids. Presentation and portion sizes were great! Everyone enjoyed their food. We d definitely come here again! Thanks again Mark! Tip for future diners: to ensure you enjoy your dinner without stressing out about being ticketed for expired parking in the Easy Park lot, make sure you pay for more than enough time, or even better, do valet parking at the restaurant. The Easy Park attendant was making his rounds and ticketing several cars.",

The fries were a lovely start for the meal and the mushroom truffle entree was a delicate dance of various taste buds for me! I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and topped it with a slice of lemon cheesecake. It was so beautiful even during the day, that I cannot wait to visit again for dinner. Highly recommend!",

Food was great, service was impeccable, cannot for the life of me remember the server s name, but he was a lovely, friendly, energetic asian man. We got a seat on the patio, and we weren t by the edge but were perfectly content nonetheless, but our server saw another table open up and helped us get a better seat. He found out it was my birthday, and when we told him we weren t interested in dessert, he looked dejected and said,  Please let me at least get you a little piece of cake!  Which I thought was hilarious. I agreed, and it was delicious. Great dinner for my birthday!",

The Summit room has a separate entrance and that worked in our favour as guests could gather outside at the entrance without impacting the main restaurant. Family from all over the world have viewed the photos and videos and all agree, the venue was fantastic for this event. Thank you to Seasons in the Park, Makda, Peter, Andre, and all the back of the house staff that made this 100 year birthday event so memorable for our Mom, ourselves, and our guests.

I recommend you be here for both lunch & dinner. The scenery and view is unique here and the restaurant resides on top of a hill above the park. The view is astonishing in both nigh and day. Food suggestions: In the Seasons In the Park, you have to drink some wine with its perfect vibe especially at night. BURROWING OWL CABERNET (BC) is a good option. All the steaks are well prepared and served exactly as you order. The Rib Steak & the Grass Fed Tenderloin are nice options. Fraser Valley Chicken is also delicious if you are into the chicken. You have nice options for the dessert. VANILLA CREME BRULEE & New York Cheesecake are both must-tries. There is Valet Parking on the premise. Enjoy!",

We had lovely window seats with a gorgeous view of the city. Their wine menu has a good variety and lots of affordable options. We ordered the brussel sprouts and crab and shrimp mushrooms to start. The brussel sprouts were crispy, a touch citrusy, and delicious. The mushrooms were really creamy, but we didnt notice the crab or shrimp flavours very much. For our mains, we ordered the duck confit and the lamb shank. Both mains were fantastic. My favourite was the lamb, it was perfectly cooked and had a delicious, rich sauce. Because we came to celebrate a birthday, they gave us a complimentary slice of chocolate cake. We also ordered the creme brulee. Overall, a great experience here and would highly recommend for a romantic night out.",

The Salmon and the QE burgers were truly delightful and quite filling.  For a quick and impromptu meal, we sat at the bar this time because we didnt want to wait for a table (reservation is highly recommended for lunch).  The view was spectacular and the service was outstanding. A solid 5 stars all around, as always. -- Seasons is by far is one of our most favourite restaurants, particularly on special occasions.  When we have guests from out-of-town, it is a restaurant that guarantees exceptional food and service, spectacular view of the city, and after lunch or dinner, a nice walk along the paths of QE Park.",

Also love that this restaurant is one of the few left that gives free bread. Also a free dessert for occasion, little things like that make you keep coming back. Hopefully be back again soon.
