            "review_text": "Fresh Ideas Start Here sells fresh and frozen sustainably caught seafood and the majority of their products are locally sourced. They have seafood that is raw and ready to cook as well as foods that have already been assembled and may just need a bit of time in the oven or on the stove before its ready to eat. (eg. Crab Cakes,Truffle Spot Prawn Mac n Cheese) To celebrate the launch of their fall seasonal menu, Fresh Ideas Start Here was offering a small bowl of complimentary seafood congee to the first 50 customers who came into their store and mentioned the word halibut. Wed never tried this seafood congee before, but apparently its a cult favourite so we went to the store right when it opened and managed to bring home some of this famed seafood congee. Oh wow! This seafood congee exceeded my expectations. I totally understand now why its a cult favourite. It was packed with seafood. They dont skimp on ingredients at this place. According to the stickers stuck onto our containers, a small congee is normally $6 and a large congee is normally $8. I would absolutely go back and pay to have this seafood congee again! Im so happy that its Fall now. With hot summer days leaving, and cooler weather arriving, we should definitely have a reason to go back for the seafood congee!

            "review_text": "Ive had this place on my radar for months, finally got a chance to order online and pick up! Their seafood congee was A++ and was apparently on special ($8, regular $10). It was packed full of seafood and so comforting! There were a few shells/bones throughout, but it was so delicious and bountiful with ingredients, we didnt mind. Just checked their site and doesnt look like its offered anymore, which would be shame, would have definitely come back for the congee alone! Also had 3 customized regular poke bowls, no complaints. The fish was so fresh and we enjoyed some of their more unique toppings, like the ginger-y squid salad. Great sauces to compliment the fish! I snagged a couple of their onigiri left from the grab-and-go section, also fair in size with a mildly spicy cooked tuna flavour. Perfect for a snack or lunch/dinner accompaniment. I picked up some frozen soup that Im excited to try, and cant wait to be back for more poke!",

However, I do go into Fresh Ideas Start Here  at least once a week to pick up something fresh. Last week it was fresh, wild pink salmon and it was amazing. They were super busy for Valentines Day but very prepared. I could not believe the amount of people coming in to pick up live lobsters and crabs. And the prices were WAY BETTER than what you would find going into a box box store - dont even want to imagine the quality of those! The sushi is good, anything salmon is top of the line.",

Also got the large $8 seafood congee which is PACKED with various seafood, halibut, scallop, octopus, shrimps. All so tender, perfectly cooked, and HUGE chunks!  Brilliant dish.  Better than chinese congee i have to say!!",
