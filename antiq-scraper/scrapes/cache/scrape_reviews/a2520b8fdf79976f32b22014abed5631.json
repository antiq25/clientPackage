But it is still 5 star for the traditional banh mi and homemade baguette.",

Not much to look at but staff is very friendly and cheerful, even though theyre busy. Cash only. You order your food than wait outside. They have a speaker outside so you can hear your number. You dont wait long. I waited about 5 minutes to finally get my order of 7 banhs. All the great reviews are bang on. First, everything is made to order and the banh is made fresh. Good crunch on outside and soft inside. Theyre bigger than most, about 12 inches long. We ordered their Special, their Bacon which is pork belly. Their Chicken, Lemongrass pork and marinated pork.  Plus their meat ball banh. All were delicious and worth the $6.50 to $7.00 each price tag. Oh they number the sandwiches according to the menu number. This way you know what type each is. Good touch. Give the place a try.",

We got the #1 Special and #5 Cold Cut, as well as a Che 6 Mau drink. I took my order slip and waited outside about five minutes. When I got the food I mentioned the last time I had that Vietnamese drink was over twenty years ago. The server told me to stir it up. Back at the car the joke was East 38th Ave was Banh Mi Saigon s parking lot, seeing all the customers carrying bags of banh mis. You can also eat at the recently put in picnic tables at adjacent Jones Park. The two sandwiches were well packed with proteins and garnish. The bread had a thin crispy crust and was soft inside. The Che 6 Mau time-warped me back to 2am Vietnamese dinners in Chinatown in Toronto. Everything was, pardon my French, friggin  delicious. I will be back to try the other sandwiches and drinks. Tried the Fish Cake Sandwich and Pandan Jelly Dessert (drink). The fish cake had a very mild flavour. It was a nice alternative to the meat options, but for me a banh mi needs to have pate, so I will try the Vietnamese Bacon next. The pandan jelly itself did not have any flavour-I was expecting herbal. So it was more textural, but the mung bean and coconut taste was very good. If I had it again I would ask for mostly mung bean if they would do that. Daniel",

Get there early or they might be sold out. The house special is killer and the Xiu Mai is out of this world. They make all the meats in house. The veggies are so fresh and has a just the right amount of mayo and spice with the fish sauce coming through to add just the right flavours and bringing it all together. Must try, guaranteed not to be disappointed.",
