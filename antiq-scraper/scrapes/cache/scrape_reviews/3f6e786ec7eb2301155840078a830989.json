Our son started with her in August 2022 and the transition from mommy care into Ravi s care was difficult, but with her loving nature and gentle way with him, he settled in and loves to go see  teacher Ravi  through the week.  Her daycare is tidy and thoroughly cleaned multiple times a day.  I cannot say enough good things about Ravi.  She s absolutely wonderful.",
