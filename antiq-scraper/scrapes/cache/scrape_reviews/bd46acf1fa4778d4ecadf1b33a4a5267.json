I would highly recommend the rose peach cake as its something I havent been able to get anywhere else and it tasted divine! The rest was sweet and tasted exactly as expected, especially the strawberry cake and the lychee black tea. Not to make that sound bad, theyre staples in every store for a reason (they never miss)!! Though, not going to lie, wasnt a huge fan of the honeycomb in my dalgona latte as it was too sweet and it was slightly unnerving every time Id encounter its crunchy texture. Still drank it all, but probably wouldnt get it again... Other than that, the decor was nice and clean and the atmosphere was quiet and serene. Also, its a little on the expensive side... so definitely more of an experience than a regular hang-out spot. Hope the employees enjoyed the relaxing morning as it seemed like a slow shift (to be fair we went around brunch time on a Tuesday). Tldr, worth it to try the rose oolong peach cake and experience the fun of the stacking cake cups.",

We were a bit confused to see the menu but the staff was explained to us very patiently. Friendly space to hang out with friends and family. Price is reasonable since can enjoy bubble tea and cake at the same time. After tasting the combo we both enjoyed their preset combination. Very unique, creative and aesthetic cup design. The peach cake is my favourite one and they sold out around 3pm today, Im glad to got it. I even ate too fast before I realized to take a picture! Rum cake can taste real rum flavour inside. They hide some raisin inside the cake to bring out the whole texture. Drinks used simple ingredients but very refreshing. I saw they were washing and cut fruits for preparation. I love to see business to use fresh ingredients to highlight their standard in food industry. Very pleasing experience for afternoon snack, will definitely go back again with our children to try their other products!",

My friend and I both got drinks and found them less sweet then we were expecting. For me, I found this a pleasant surprise, but she got a matcha drink and didnt like it as much. So, if you are expecting or wanting a bubble tea level of sweetness, might want to check with the staff about which drinks are sweet.

You can easily devour the delectable   and immediately go for a sip of the  , rinse and repeat   Wonder if someone patented that design because it s just genius and perfect for devouring on the run Had the  cake + lychee iced tea combo with zero sugar and boy this combo was super yum! Cake was sweetened just right and took me back to my childhood when I gorged on Melona treats, but this was better! The Lychee tea had really refreshing fruit bits, this combo is solid! Also tried the   raspberry   cake + hawthorn dates refresher with zero sugar and this was fab too. Now here s my 2 cents on the pricing of the 2 dessert combo - it s pretty fair y all! First we typically pay $7 for a decent cake anyway and also another $7 for a good quality non powdered bbt (you know what I m talking about) and this place is a one-stop shop for you to address your need for a little something nice and sweet.

            "review_text": "Late Review We have ordered from Minus Cake Boutique for many festive occasions and our favourite cake is the Jasmine Pearl Lava Cake. It is very creamy with subtle salty and sweet caramelized filling. Unfortunately when I bought the 8inch cake for my mothers birthday November 27, 2021, we discovered the cream in the centre was sour- like sour cream. This made the entire cake taste weird and off-putting . We called the next morning to ask the baker if they knew what happened, although they were not sure and had some hypothesis (maybe they forgot to thin out the cream with fresh cream?) Minus Cake Boutique took ownership of their product and offered to refund (if we bring the cake back) or make a replacement cake. I purchased many times from Minus and a refund was not what I was looking for. I simply wanted to inform them about the quality of their item. There was no way my family could eat another whole  8inch cake (we hate wastage and were determined to carve the sour cream part out of the first cake and make do with what we had) so I suggested making a smaller 6inch one so that we could taste what the cake should taste like. Minus Cake Boutique delivered and we picked up the remade cake and I am grateful and super happy to say, it tasted just the way we remembered it to be. Thank you very much for coming through with excellent customer service. We are very happy and will continue to buy your specialty cakes in the future. Already eyeing another cake for our next festive celebration.",

Having drink and cake at the same time in one cup is definitely a game changer! At first I was a bit skeptical thinking of the combo would be too sweet but surprisingly it wasn t at all. Visited this place 2 times and my favorite combo is the peach slush and peach oreo cake.. the earl grey cake is pretty tasty too. Strawberry milk taste a bit bland but once you stir the strawberry compote well on the bottom..It s pretty amazing..the pear osmanthus drink was bit too light for my taste but my wife loved it..overall great place with friendly staff and great desserts! Def becoming my go to place!",
