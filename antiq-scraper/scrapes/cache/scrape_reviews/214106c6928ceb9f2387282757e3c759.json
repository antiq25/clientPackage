            "review_text": "I love coming to Pink Peppercorn and it never disappoints! Every time I come i always rotate with the rack of lamb or the seafood pasta. The rack of lamb is always cooked to perfection and the mashed potatoes is to die for because it s not like any mashed potatoes I ve ever had its sweet but savory at the same time. The portions are big plenty of veggies on the plate and presentation is always beautiful. The seafood pasta is so delish! I love the variety and amount of seafood that it comes with. Today my friend and I shared the mushroom soup. It was one of the features of the night and it was the best mushroom soup I ve ever tasted! Rich, creamy and packed with flavor! I loved how the mushroom was blended but u can still taste the mushrooms and it had a nice garlic flavor. I wish it was a permanent item on the menu I d take this mushroom soup over the clam chowder anytime! Our servers Arturo and Teddy bear both give great service with a great sense of humor! Hopefully next time I ll try something else off the menu!",

            "review_text": "I had to write a review after my family and I had a fantastic dinner last night at Pink Peppercorn. It is my brother s favourite place, but it has been a while for me since I no longer live nearby. Not only did the food exceed our expectations, so did the service. I had the smoked sablefish, which was accompanied by a huge portion of veggies. It was a good portion, and super well plated. Others had the New York steak, cedar planked salmon, the salmon Wellington, and rack of lamb. Everyone was super happy with their meals. We also ordered the calamari starter, which was very fresh! The meal came with their complimentary warm bread and lobster oil, which was divine. The star was our server. The lone man appeared to be working the entire restaurant alone. Serving, taking orders, and even bartending. He didn t skip a beat, and I was blown away. He deserves 5 stars and a big raise/bonus! Thank you for a wonderful evening,",

We loved it here, we had a professional waiter - a fellow who could read the table, make recommendations and have facility with the menu. It s a rare skill these days and is a lost art. I value old school anything so I feel this is a restaurant meant for people who know what they want. It s not an effete molecular cuisine restaurant or a fish and chip joint.  The portions are generous and the flavours are dynamic- if pepper, garlic and onion are your friends, you need to run here as soon as possible. We will Return , we had the smoked sablefish and the salmon Wellington and wish I had an extra stomach to try the other dishes.",

The place was at full capacity yet our appetizers and entrees were served exceptionally fast. Its obvious the kitchen is run at a high standard. The seafood and vegetables taste like they were pulled from the ocean and garden that day. Notably the lobster bisque was rich and creamy while the mixed seafood pasta was loaded with clams,salmon, scallops and prawns. Definitely try the smokey, buttery Alaskan Cod as it is absolutely delicious. The trio of tartar was light refreshing and super tasty. I have been here twice and both times I have left  feeling  like the meals were prepared by someone who loves you.",

I wouldn t recommend the cocktails- not the best to be honest so go for the wine. The food was amazing. The seafood platter was incredibly large for a 1 person portion! Tasted fresh. The calamari was very large- bit greasy and that didn t sit best in the stomach. SO when the salmon Wellington main came- it was hard to really dig in and enjoy it! But oh man- as leftovers, the large portion of salmon Wellington was so so delicious. The mash potatoes and veggies did taste a bit too buttery and sat heavy. Also- the pictures below is ONE entree split into 2. Definitely not leaving hungry. Amazing service! Will definitely come back and try the halibut!",

Nice staff, nice atmosphere, i will definitely come back! I was wondering why almost everyone asked for a box to go, and then i realized that is because the portions are really big! I also asked for a box to go and will have a delicious lunch tomorrow! 100% recommended",

Like many others, I really regret not trying it out sooner because this place was phenomenal. The type of dishes they put are classics. Nothing experimental, but just straightforward really well executed food. All the dishes were well seasoned, cooked to perfection and came at a timely manner. The waiter Teddy Bear was charming and attentive, ensuring my Chinese parents always had a constant flow of hot water. Portions were insanely fair priced. I ordered the salmon wellington which was stuffed with small shrimp and a large portion of salmon. Pastry was a perfect thickness, flakey and not soggy. Calamari and the trio tartar was also a favourite tonight, and we cant forget about the insanely flavorful lobster oil with bread. Looking forward to coming back again! Book early, this place really fills up on the weekends!",

Either plan on sharing or taking stuff home. I had the bouillabaisse and it was loaded with clams, mussels, salmon, cod, halibut, sable fish, and scallops. The broth had just the right amount of spicy kick (for a non spicy eater) and had plenty of vegetables as well. Save some of the bread to dip in the broth My kids had the calamari and a kids pasta with veggie medley in a tomato sauce. Calamari was done with a light batter and fried to the right amount of crispy. The veggie medley was spectacular loaded with broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, peppers, and a tiny bit of apparatus stalks. My parents had the salmon wellington and the daily chef creation (peppercorn crusted halibut). Salmon Wellington is highly recommended and highly recommend it to share. The halibut aroma and flavor was indescribable. Kid-friendliness: They have kid friendly items that they offer but no defined kids menu. The staff were super nice and friendly towards the kids at every table while maintaining a level of professionalism for the guests without kids",

            "review_text": "HUGE portion! Delicious! Great value for money! My boyfriend and I ordered two appetizers and two mains, and we couldnt finish our food. For the main dish, I got the halibut with lobster sauce - first of all, the size of the fish was quite big, very fresh and well seasoned too. There was mushroom and shrimps in the lobster sauce. I love the generous amount of veggies they gave you. There was literally HALF a head of broccoli on my plate! My boyfriend got the salmon wellington - again, it was enormous! Everything on the plate was very tasty. The salmon was cooked to perfection and still pink on the inside. Im usually not a fan of cooked salmon because its usually dry and fishy to my taste, but this salmon dish was very well done. Not dry at all and super flavorful! It was so big that even my boyfriend couldnt finish it and had to take half home. This place is such a gem! Next time well probably just get one or two appetizers and share one main dish. Excited to try their seafood platter, smoked cod and the seafood bouillonbaisse in the future.",

            "review_text": "What a gem of a place! We are obsessed now. The food and service are stars here. You can tell dishes have been thoughtfully developed and put together by a master, forwarding quality and taste. Yes, the portions are huge, which is surprising given the ingredients. And the flavours! Was expecting the linguine to be watery and mediocre (like at Joe Fortes), but the sauce was fresh, garlicky, rich, perfectly reduced, and delectable. The mashed potatoes are dangerously addictive. We were all very happy with what we ordered. The gentleman who served us is a true professional. It was such a treat to experience his service. Humorous and gracious, he took extra care without a blink splitting a main and preparing our dad s birthday cake for us. Because we all drove, we opted not to order drinks. Most staff at restaurants at this price point would be annoyed by this and it would show. But not here. The tableware and linens were clean. The decor is dark and vintage, but adds a cozy feel. The bathrooms are humble, but also clean. The room is medium sized and the music is not too loud or trying to force a mood. We went at 5:30 and stayed til about 7/7:30 and it was very pleasant, attentive, and calm throughout. This place is simply about good food and unpretentious service that still makes you feel special and cared for. Makes you reevaluate the quality and service you receive at other restaurants that prioritize form over substance. Here it is very much about substance. Delicious substance over form. Thank you and congratulations to the team. We will be back!!",

The food was absolutely delicious, hats off to the chef making such incredible dishes. I recommend everyone to try their Trio Tartars and their mussell, clam and chorizo app (its not on their menu, but show them the picture hopefully they can make it for you).  Entrees wise I had Peppercorn crust Ahi Tuna (delicious) Wife had Halibut with a name too fancy to remember (equally amazing). I saw the lobsters looked delicious too! Wish we could have a third / fourth stomach. Thanks for the memories. Will visit again when I come back to Vancouver in the future",

The restaurant itself is very cozy and I love going here for birthdays or special occasions. Their lobster oil is mouthwatering. I could probably drink it because it s that good. The warm papaya shrimp salad was delightful. The peppercorn in the dressing gave it a nice kick. The shrimp was juicy and cooked perfectly! The mussels were also delicious. I love the white wine garlic sauce it was in. The sable fish was so buttery and paired amazingly with the lemon butter sauce. I also tried the chef s special of the day which was the halibut in a tarragon sauce. Loved the addition of mushrooms and shrimp to this dish! The salmon wellington is also a classic and you can never go wrong on this choice. Thanks Eddy and team for an exquisite dining experience!",

The salmon wellington was the best I have ever tried, and lasted me two more meals after, because the portions are fking huge! We also ordered their seafood pasta which surprisingly (unlike other Vancouver restaurants), had more seafood than noodles. There were giant pieces of scallop and prawn which was so satisfying to see. Again, the pasta lasted us another meal as well. Service was A+ too. Not snooty, welcoming and cozy atmosphere.

Its kind of hidden and unassuming but it was a great atmosphere for group dinner. Great options for both seafood and meat lovers.  I especially loved my mussels appetizer.  The portions were pretty generous.  My son really enjoyed his chocolate dessert as well.",

The seafood tasted very fresh, portions ate quite large and presentation colorful and on point. Steaks were cooked well, asked for medium rare but more on the medium side. Mussels to start were super yummy, very meaty with good broth that went along with it. Ended up drinking up all the broth. The had ordered two tartars but I wasnt a big fan of it. Wasnt anything special. Arctic char was on special, we had ordered 3 plates of it and man were they delicious. Monk fish was fantastic. The mango salsa that accompanied it was perfect. West coast bouillabaisse was disappointing. The broth ended up being a bit bland and the seafood in the dish didnt really shine on the same level as all the other dishes. Overall everything was good except for tartar and bouillabaisse. Staff was super friendly and funny. Would come back again for sure. Great place.",

With steep prices and no view, the quality of the food and service is really what makes this place shine! My husband enjoyed the clam chowder and complimentary bread wit lobster oil. I loved the sea food platter for 1 and would highly recommend it. We shared the Alaskan smoked cod. It was a bit heavy after the other 2 dishes so I might recommend something else or maybe passing on the cream based soup. There was a small fee of $4, but the portions are huge so I recommend it.",

The price is of a high end place given the quality of the food (amazing everytime), great service and nice portion. My favorites from the menu are the mussels (the plumpest, never overcooked), the catfish entree (spicy crust on the blacked catfish paired with mango salsa creating the perfect flavor combo and the side of the best mashed potato youll find), the seafood fettuccini (huge chunks of fish and different types of shellfish in a delicious tomato-based sauce). Of course the complimentary lobster oil with warm toasty bread is another big PLUS!  Perfect place for special occasions or just when you feel like eating amazing seafood!",

Many thumbs up for him!! Definately recommend trying this place if youre a seafood lover. Environment: nice cozy feel with perfectly lighted environment with easy-listening music that is not over the top like some restaurants now a days. Will be coming back.",

Im glad we read the reviews ahead of time and ordered just one first course (lobster bisque) and two main course dishes (salmon wellington and seafood pasta) after reading that their portions are huge. We are going home super full and still have half of each main course dishes in take out boxes. And the flavours... my goodness. Every bite was amazing. Mere words arent enough to describe them. Oh and lets not forget their amazing fresh bread with their signature lobster oil. Our server Paul was brilliant.  He is friendly, very welcoming, and when he took photos of my husband  and me, he took multiple photos from different angles. Ladies, for those of you who know the angles matter in photos, you KNOW hes a gem. The experience from the moment we were seated to the moment we walked out the door after a lovely gesture (complimentary cream brule) to wish us happy anniversary was very memorable and we look forward to trying other dishes from their menu next time.",

From the moment I walked in, friendly attentive waiters that made you feel so welcome, an excellent menu (I hardly know what to choose, everything looks so tempting!) and a cosy yet elegant setting. Although this restaurant specialises in seafood but they also serve a really great rack of lamb. For starters, the Trio of Tartare was an explosion of fun flavours, with salmon, tuna and scallop. I am pretty sure the rest of the menu wont disappoint either, definitely will return in the future. Highly recommend when you are looking for something special for dinner.",
