They did change their menu after they reopened. I plan to try every one of them eventually. This place is so underrated compared to the other Indian restaurant a few minutes east on the same street thats not nearly as good. I hope customers come here to try first before they go to the other ones. They have daily specials as well! Highly recommend!!",

I tell them desi spicy, to where you feel the burn go down Their portions are also decently large for value, and they are the most kind and friendly staff.

We dropped in for some dosa and ended up eating thair (dahi) vadai and vada kari (curry) as well. Each dish was truly authentic and had different spices that were clearly freshly and individually made. The portion sizes were so generous that we packed the leftovers (enough for one meal). The highlight of the evening is that we decided to take home a package of their chicken biryani because we saw one of the staff members eating it when we entered the restaurant and it smelled like heaven. Of course, we couldnt leave without that dish even though we were full AND we had leftovers. From our experience, restaurant staff from India only eat where they work if the food is truly authentic and tasty. And Im so glad to say that it was both. We are from South India and we live in Vancouver where theres lots of great Indian food, but mostly from Punjab. I think we hit the jackpot here for South Indian food. Well be bringing all our friends and family here for sure. A shout-out to Raja who was incredibly thoughtful with his suggestions, was great to talk to about life back in India, and also snuck in a free gulab jamun (traditional dessert) with our packed biriyani. Thank you!",

The food was completely prepared and packed. I meet and talked to the chef, he asked me to put a review in Google after tasting their food and only if  I like taste. Those words communicated the confidence and trust they are having in their foods quality and taste. Even I reached home after 45 minutes, the food was absolutely delicious and it was holding the real blend of South Indian cuisines flavor. Especially the dosa was really satisfying, even after being kept in container for a while. Thanks to Philip, Venki and KP Wish you all the very best .",

            "review_text": "Ive ordered delivery from this place a few times, and every experience has been good. Tonight, Uber screwed up, and I never ended up with my order even though the driver had marked it as delivered. Our food was nowhere to be found, and after asking to connect with the driver on the app, he finally fessed up that a different driver had taken the order. I have no idea why the driver didnt just let us know when the mistake had happened. He then told us to contact the restaurant. The lady who answered the phone was very polite, respectful, and understanding of the situation. She did, indeed, confirm the order number with the delivery driver who took it. She passed the call on to the manager who was equally understanding and helpful. They both took the time to listen, and I never felt rushed or got the impression that I was taking up their time. I know that they were more inconvenienced than we were, as they had to redo the entire order again. Thank you to the staff, kitchen, and management at Dosa World for stepping in and rectifying somebody elses mistake. We were able to get our  order at last without any issues. P.S. For those of you wondering, there are three dosa restaurants on this stretch of Kingsway. House of Dosas, Dosa Factory, and the newest addition, Dosa World, which is this restaurant. I have tried all of them several times, and I can confirm that the food, service, and the people are the best here.",
