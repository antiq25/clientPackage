The service is top notch, and the food is out of this world!! Tried the roast lamb..some of the best Ive ever had!! The prices are really reasonable, too. Even the ambience is great. Cant wait to try the Sunday roast (on Sunday, obviously). This was my first time, sure wont be the last!!! (Also, drink specials are pretty amazing too!)",

Finding free parking as well as paid parking is difficult on Main Street with the patio dining and residential restrictions. However Summertime is here! Just walk a bit to burn off what you eat, or make way for a spot for dessert at Breka or Innocence. I love their fries! Crispy! Dippable with the ketchup on the side. I kind of wished that i ordered the first burger, but I was going to order the Greek. Instead the word bacon got to me, so as long as it had bacon, that was going to be my order. One should sit and enjoy the Main Street atmosphere using the summer. Its a different experience.",

Be the food, ambiance, their cutlery, the cocktails are amazing or a beer if you prefer, whatever the mood. The salad with hugging sauces inviting to taste their variety. Everything clean new and sparkly. Situated on the Main street, it serves a variety of fresh Greek preparations made the traditional way, also lots of finger food and Americanized deliciousness. I have tried loads of dishes on their menu, my favourite being the Gyros- wrap, tzatziki and a selection of vegetables / Feta / olives and veg exotica. Other dishes are also good. The souvlaki is excellently moist and tender through their marinating process, a perfectly grilled wonder. I always feel coming back to this place, grabbing an outdoor seating with beautiful view of the city and sumptuous meal. Finishing with an Ouzo or my favourite Tsipouro making it an other meal never to be forgotten but repeated. Highly recommended! Love, love, LOVE it!",

Parking in the street was a bit of an issue as there is no free parking but since it was nearly 10pm, (the cut off time for the timed meters) I parked at one and paid 15 cents for 7 mins. We were greeted promptly after we entered the place and were asked to seat ourselves. It felt really nice to be acknowledged so fast especially when they were that busy. This wasnt my first time visiting and I have not had  bad experience as of yet. I always enjoyed their Greek American fusion style food. But this night I only ordered drinks. Despite the fact that they were a restaurant, they did not pressure me into buying food also. This was a plus for me. The server was very rugged looking, the only thing about this was there was no set uniform for the servers and it made it difficult to tell if the server was a server or patron. The drinks we got were amazing, they were out of a particular vodka for my mixed drink but the server expertly explained to me what other options for vodka were available my drink was still very good and a pretty hue of purple whereas normally it wont be. Overall, a very good experience, will definitely visit again.",

Both were tasty (although my husband complained about the metal tray his food came on, it kept sliding all over the wooden table). The real highlight of our visit was the girl who greeted and served us, Jalicia. Friendly, personable, and so attentive, she really made our evening. We were never without water or coffee, and checked back often to see if we needed anything. Wow! I am so used to lackadaisical servers who take your order, serve it, and thats it. No customer service, no refills, no smile - in other words, crappy service. What a refreshing change at The Main. Jalicia was everything a server could be and more. Shes a gem! Thanks for helping us really enjoy our evening out",
