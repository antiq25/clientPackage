            "review_text": "Great experience, from the time that I took the complimentary shadow from the Airport to The hotel Holiday Inn Express Richmond, the driver Dean, Dean, he was very nice and courteous,  he gave me a lot of information of how to get around the hotel, restaurants and places to visit,  The staff at Front Desk where nice and professional. The rooms are nice clean and comfortable, Breakfast was good and enough to get you started and ready for your day. I stayed here 2 weekends in a row total of 4 nights. The housekeeper Li (both w-ends) was very nice and friendly. The hotel is well located, conveniently close to the airport (24/7 complimentary shuttle or if you are driving secure parking is available) close to the Bridgeport Station (about 10 minutes walk) where you can take the TransLink Metro, Vancouvers transportation network, it will allow you to go anywhere, either by train or bus. Next door to the hotel there is Costco, and a few restaurants that are walking distance. Rooms: Rooms are nice, clean and very comfortable. Food & drinks: Good breakfast to start your day. Few restaurants within walking distance. Noteworthy details: From the hotel location, you have access to the Bridgeport Station (10 minutes walk) and go anywhere from there.",

Loved how they went above and beyond then respected our space when napping. Great location, buttery soft beds, pillows and bedding. Great products in the room for our comfort. Continental breakfast was actually cooked in kitchen, meals, food prep and serving set up was all immaculate. Best hotel stay yet. Rooms: Roomy, gorgeous lighting, work desk and office chair, comfortable, white noise machine ( not needed as it was quiet) Walkability: Near all major bus and train routes, short walk to places.

The main concern we had when booking this hotel was the noise (we are generally quite sensitive to noise during sleep), but it wasnt a big deal at all during our 3-night stay. All the rooms are facing the highway, I believe, so there wasnt any road noise. We didnt hear any airplane noise either. Some of the reviews have mentioned the truck unloading noise at the Costco right next to it, but I dont think I heard that before 9 AM, and with the white noise machine on, I dont think any noise outside would have impacted our sleep. Rooms: The room was spacious. Food & drinks: There were plenty of food options for the free breakfast. The best among the hotels Ive stayed at in the past year that offer free breakfast.",

The rooms were spacious and clean with tons of electrical outlets to charge. Showers had adjustable water pressure. Service was great; parking was only $10/night. Breakfast for us was free and the variety was pretty good! There was also a cool pancake making machine. Beds were a bit too soft for our likings (we have a medium firm bed at home) and the walls were a little thin (we could hear the kids and water from our neighboring room).

We had to fly to Philippines and had nowhere to park our truck for the month-long that we will be gone and no other hotel will let you park your car that long in the vicinity other than the Holiday Inn. The staff were very helpful in answering and accomodating all our queries and gave us a very reasonable price as well for the whole month that we will have to leave our truck. It was also a great and secured area so it gave us peace of mind  while we were away. Location is very convenient as well as its just near the airport. Just right across the hotel is Costco if you needed something and some restaurants as well. They also serve complimentary breakfast which exceeded my expectation. All in all, it was a great and stress-free experience during our stay and will definitely come back if ever we are in the area again.",

If you dont need any fancy frills but want accommodating service, clean room/washroom, great bed and need to be close to the airport, this is it. Desk chair was even decent that I fell asleep watching the wall mounted TV that swivels. Staff easily booked a 4AM shuttle to the airport and light breakfast was ready even at that time (wish I couldve taken advantage of the main breakfast). If I had to be super picky, it was just slightly dim in terms of lighting in the main part of the room. Also, after checking in the cleaning lady(?) entered the room without knocking with a keycard which startled us but who wouldnt be.",

Excellent customer service, thoughtful room amenities like white noise machine and universal PC workstation, 24 hour free shuttle, free full breakfast, at a great value. Id recommend it if people are looking for an inexpensive over nighter near the airport, especially for those on business trips. Punches well above its weight class. (P.S. The free coffee made me do a double take - tastes pretty dang good, like diner coffee.)",

This was one of best places I have actually stayed  considering all factors. Staff was super nice, helpful and accommodating. They let me check in early and when my room wasnt going to be ready they put me in something else and did not charge me for that. Breakfast was perfect for those mornings on the fly and the rooms were super clean. The beds and linen are what I look forward to the most in any hotel and I didnt want to get out of bed it was that good for me. Indoor parking was ample, secure and easy to use. The team here should be proud of what they have because my experience and other reviews support how well they do here Thanks and I will see you again when I need a spot before flying out of BC Cheers Dave B",

We really appreciate the shuttle driver for accommodating our delayed evening flight. The other staff were super friendly and pleasant as well. There are great amenities in the rooms, even more than some other hotels I ve been at. The free breakfast is great with a good selection. There are pancakes, various proteins that change everyday, bread, fruits, and drinks. It s in a good area: the hotel is a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest transit station (depending on if you cut across the Costco parking lot), and it s across the street from a Costco and a great Chinese restaurant. The free shuttle only takes 10 minutes and it s fairly frequent. The only concern is the noise level, which is totally out of the staff s control. I could always hear things from the Costco loading dock, and since it s close to the airport we can hear planes all the time. Besides that, I would still highly recommend the hotel to everyone.",

Unfortunately my wife had a medical emergency the morning we were going to leave, requiring surgery and a lengthy hospital stay for her and extended stay at the hotel for me. All the staff was great, but a special shout out to Jon at the front desk, who rushed to our room to assist when I called 911 from the room phone. He also arranged for me to keep the room for the additional 7 nights. Thank you Jon, your help during that stressful time was very much appreciated. Since I was in the hotel much longer than expected, there were some other things about the hotel I appreciated: 1) the features of the room. Nice tv, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, lots of outlets and usb ports, a small window that actually opened, office desk area. 2) proximity to the sky train. It was about a 10 minute walk to the station. 3) coin op laundry machines. Needless to say, we didnt have a lot of clean clothes left since we were supposed to be at the end of our trip, so having laundry on site was a huge benefit. Again, thanks to Jon and the rest of the staff.",

            "review_text": "After our cruise, I wanted to stay an extra night in Vancouver because I just love this city! I chose this Holiday Inn Express because it was super close to the train station from the Port of Vancouver and also a $10 ride to the airport. It took us maybe 10 minutes to walk with our luggage - just dont listen to Google when it tells you to walk through the Costco lot on a Sunday. Because they were sold out the night before from other cruises, we were unable to check in early (10a) but Cindy checked our luggage and we went to Gastown for the day. After lunch (1p), I called to see if we could check in early and they said that we could. Cindy checked us in and thanked me for being an IHG member. She informed us about breakfast times and also asked if we needed a shuttle ride to the airport, which is complimentary! Yes, we definitely need a ride to the airport. It picks up on the 20 and 40 of every hour and I would suggest showing up 3 hours prior to your international flight. The room was so much larger than I expected and the bed was so comfortable! The bathroom is also larger than most other hotel rooms so that is really nice to have so much space. In addition to the king bed, we had a desk and chair, a wardrobe, a larger mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, chaise lounger, and a closet. They also provide Dove shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in refillable containers to be more eco friendly and offer a white noise machine to help you sleep. I would definitely stay here again due to how friendly the staff is, the proximity to public transportation, proximity to the Richmond Night Market (10 min walk), and how spacious and comfortable the room is.",

The beds are amazingly comfortable, there s a fridge and a microwave, a coffee machine in your room, a white noise machine, nice furniture and the breakfast in the morning is very nice for a complimentary hotel breakfast. We used the fitness room and it was surprisingly really nice. Like I would be happy if that was the fitness room in my apartment! The staff was also very friendly and remembered me each time I saw them. I m thinking of going back to a holiday inn express now and canceling the rest of my stay at the Marriott!! Haha!!!",

The shuttle is every 30 mins from level 3 courtesy shuttle pick up area, easy to find, quick to the hotel lobby. Check in took 2 mins and then were in the room. Comfortable bed with soft sheets and feathery pillows, well laid out room, big closet... It does the simple things right for a low cost option. There is even an adjustable white noise machine if you want/need one to sleep. Ill definitely be back the next time Im stuck at YVR for the night.",

I would have never booked a room for her there if I read the reviews. Whoever is in charge of this Holiday inn is doing a great job training their staff.

The staff were friendly and accommodating, special shout out to Eric and Joanna in particular for fantastic front desk service. The free daily breakfast is quite nice, I definitely recommend the pancakes. Cleaning and towel changes were done regularly and well. The complimentary shuttle saved us fares both ways to and from the airport (only a 10 minute ride). The nearest Skytrain station is Bridgeport, which is a less-than-10-minute walk. Add on another five minutes, and you can reach the Richmond Night Market! Our room had a Keurig, Microwave, Fridge, and TV available for use. Of particular note to me was the size of the TV. Most hotels Ive been to choose rather small screen sizes, but the size and placement of this one was near optimal for the beds. The only thing I can speak negatively about (which is out of their control) is the noise. You WILL hear the Costco across the street unload at night. My wife was able to sleep through it, but I was glad I packed ear plugs. I also recommend closing the bathroom door as night, as the ventilation system seems to channel in the noise from outside.",

Into the pillow case was sewn soft or firm which makes it easy to pick your pillow. In room as well was a Keurig coffee maker with 4 pods so you didnt have to go down to the buffet.

The room was very comfortable and was clearly recently updated, with tons of USB ports, modern furniture, and a very sleek washroom. The service was great, the person at the front prepared a to-go breakfast for me because I had to leave before the breakfast. She also booked me on the shuttle for the morning but it had filled up so she made sure a cab arrived for me and it was pre-paid, so I was very grateful for this service. The only issues I had were that it took a while to get ahold of the front desk when I called from the airport to arrange a shuttle, and the shower in the morning took a while to warm up. But overall, I would highly recommend if you need something close to the airport because of a layover, missed flight, etc.",

Feels brand new. Breakfast is not ordinary. Finding a cinnamon bread is something different for me compare to a muffin that all other hotels offers. Transfers to and from airport is smooth and round the clock. There is also a station for printing documents which was very useful in printing or boarding pass before heading to the airport. A vending machine with drinks and snacks seals the gap of our hungry tummy. Lots of restaurants in the area that delivers to the hotel too. They would also all if you want to have a Wake up call. Superb service. Bathrooms with branded toiletries and complete accessories. Huge windows and comfy bed. Pillows are a highlight. Large tv and coffee corner. Microwave helps me a lot. Fridge kept my food fresh but I forgot them upon leaving. Overall satisfied and will be back.",

I slept very well, and awoke rested. The modified breakfast (due to COVID-19 adjustments) was a good start for the day. And when it came time to leave, the front desk staff (sorry, didnt catch his name) was kind to offer me a free taxi to the airport as the shuttle was going to be full. Overall a genuine 5-star stay.

There is something to be said about a newly renovated hotel. The rooms are clean, contemporary, have lots of USB outlets, a white noise machine, and a large flat screen TV. There are no towel bars and the bathtub feels a bit cheap but those are minor and are the only negatives I could point out. The free breakfast is more than acceptable and includes bacon, turkey sausage, eggs, yogurt, fruit, cereal and a pancake machine. Long term parking is available for a pretty low rate if you stay at least one night at the hotel. This is accompanied by a free shuttle to and from the airport running every half hour. Regular guest parking is underground which is a perk. It was nice being across the street from Costco for a quick meal. Tim Hortons is also just around the corner. To top it off, the staff were friendly and quick to answer my questions. I would definitely stay here again.",

Room equipped with keurig, new thin TV with HDMI ports on the wall, cool lights, everything is brand new. Free breakfast from 6-10AM. Few minutes drive to airport. Easy to find street parking outside. (Parked just across the street, it was empty) free coffee 24/7 in the lobby. Best deal in town!!!",
