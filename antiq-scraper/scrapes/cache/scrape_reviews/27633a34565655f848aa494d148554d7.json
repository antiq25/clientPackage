House cut fries and homemade tartar sauce were amazing! Best part, they value providing high quality food such as using Canadian made vegetable oil as opposed to canola oil, which greatly impacted the flavour and didnt make the texture overly greasy.

The interior is pretty basic and nothing to write home about, but the food was delicious and service quick. I got the halibut which was fried to perfection - crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside. The fries and coleslaw were also fantastic though I would ve liked a bit more slaw because it was so good. Husband got the regular fish (we re assuming cod) which was also delicious and cheaper than halibut. He got the chowder with his combo which lacked salt but was an easy fix and would be good for those trying to be mindful of their salt intake. We were the only customers for a while on a Tuesday at lunch so you wouldn t have to wait long if you re in a rush. We will definitely be back!",

The combo is less than $7 and it includes fish, chips, seafood chowder soup, coleslaw, mayo sauce, ketchup. And one of the staff approached to me and asked how the food is. I can see that they are so caring of customers. Everything was great, but the greatest one was seafood soup. I was really craving for a cream soup, and I was fully satisfied with this soup. The French fries were ordinary though. The black coffee was instant one but it was only $1.5, so I liked it. I will visit again for sure !!!",

            "review_text": "Truly a hidden gem of a small fish and chips diner on Kingsway...Water, menu, condiments and ordering of the food were ready and available within minutes. The lunch combo fish was lightly battered and cooked to perfection! And to my delight, the senior woman owner came to greet us at the table and to ask in her Cantonese if everything was to our liking. Fortunately with my minimal Canadian Chinese, I said yes and thanked her as I would like to do the same in this review. To Seahouse Fish and Chips, thank you       for your service and the YUMMY fish combo.  Will definitely return and share this review with other diners. Kid-friendliness: Both younger and senior women owners are so hospitable that they will go out of their way to make their restaurant like your home. Wheelchair accessibility: Tables and chairs are flexible and light to move around in the large dining space.",

You can t even get a quarter pounder at McDonalds for that price. The burger s patty is real beef, unlike McDonald s. The fish and fries are freshly fried right in front of you, and the batter is perfectly crispy and fresh is tender. The fries aren t salted, so make sure to salt them at home. I would love to try the halibut, but they ve been out the 3 times I ve been there. ~$30 for 10 pieces of fish + 3 fries, coleslaw, and gravy is such a good deal! Customer service is great, two or three Cantonese speaking aunties work there, they ve been running for 20-30 years. They tried to talk to my friend and I with our limited Cantonese/Mandarin skills. So nice!!! This place is a Vancouver hidden gem, standing strong in the face of inflation. I will be so sad if this place closes.",

The portions and price are perfect as well. They take cash only, so I assume thats why there isnt a skipthedishes/ubereats/doordash option for delivery. If there were, Id be ordering here a lot more.

And wish the fries were homemade. Overall, would go back again because their fish was indeed done very well and price is great value. Doesnt seem like they reuse the oil so much that makes the food taste bitter, so well done. Would go back and try the halibut instead",

They accept cash only. Thats why they can offer just a low price. The point of sale systems will make the cost of food rise. I admire mother of store owner she is 90 years old and she cooks fish for us perfectly done. She is inspired me. Definitely we will be their regular customers",

The fries are decent & not as crispy, being in the supporting role, but quite filling with all that potato.  Even with the increase in price, which is very fair, solid deal on the dinner for two! (of course I was hoping for the family pack, not being too heavy on clam chowder, but the other half had eyes on that) To maintain that freshness, make sure you get home FAST! (drive or walk safely of course) We will be back, & whatever it is we order.. itll pair nicely with beers. Cheers!  #supportlocal",

For a very reasonable price, you will enjoy a decent 2 piece fiah and chips without much to complain about. We were impressed that the fish was lightly battered, and not greasy or thick with dough. For this price, I was afraid that it was going to be a treasure hunt searching for the fish in the batter. In fact ours was not even  pre-battered . I saw with my eyes   four fresh fillets being coated and dropped into the fryer! The fries were good too. We forgot to grab some salt, but still good enough to munch down every crumb. There is little to be impressed by visual distractions, but I feel this is a secret for some of the best cheap eats in West Coast dinner food, and if you take a momment to chat to the owners, it is made up in delightful character.",

For most fish and chips place, they coat their fish with heaping amount of batter so that the customer get more flour and fish. This place do it just right: Thin coat that makes the fish crunchy but not get in the way of fish. Also we did not eat in the restaurant and have it as a takeout. The fact that the food is still nice and crunchy after the drive back gives you an idea of the quality (Ive seen many fried foods turned soggy after even a short drive) The owner is generous in servings: 10 piece cod, 2 coleslaw, 3 fries and gravy for $24!!

Comes with clam chowder and cold slaw for $7.95.  Chowder is commercial chowder but thick and tasty.  Two pieces of fish done to perfection.  I had the combo with battered shrimp.

They adjusted the price once in the past 15 years in January 2022 due to pandemic rises in food costs. And I was so surprised that they only increased a dollar twenty-five here and 75 cents there! I asked the boss why not increased the price to at least match the competitors because the new prices are still 20% to 30% below market. She says, l want to make sure all our meals are affordable for the neighbours and long-term customers; I just need to break even, I dont need the extra cash!",

Id never thought to go here because the place always looked closed (security bars across windows, dark inside) when in fact it was opened all the time.   Theres also a park down the road so well be stopping by with the kids this summer and taking the fish and chips down to the park for a picnic lunch in the sun. Update: tried a hamburger with cheese on a second visit. Recommend! The patty covers the entire bun, condiments all fresh. The seahouse patty isnt chewy like a McDonalds patty and a lot bigger (except quarter pounder). The seas house patty doesnt have MSG like an A&W patty (wont leave you thirsty!).  Its just a good ole homemade burger, with fries, and it came to 5.80. Cheap good and fast! (how is it possible for any restaurant to get all three?!, rules for cheap, good, fast, pick two but leave one out, but sea house has all three, cheap, good AND fast).",

Vancouver used to have lots of places like this ages ago but I havent been to one in about two decades. I definitely recommend if youre looking for an inexpensive meal from memory lane.",

They dont use cod anymore, so your choices are halibut, salmon, and fish. Probably tilapia, but its pretty good. The other standout bargain on the menu is the family pack. It has to be ordered as take out, and it comes with 10 pieces of fish, 3 orders of chips, 2 coleslaws, 2 gravies, tartar sauce, and lemon wedges--for $23 including tax. It easily feeds my family of four, and the kids love it. This place is an East Van gem, and a great place if you miss the Vancouver of yesteryear. Old school vibe, delicious, no-frills food, and the old school prices to match.",
