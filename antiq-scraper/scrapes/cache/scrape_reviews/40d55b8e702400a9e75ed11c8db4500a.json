The house made sesame sauce is to die for and the unlimited cabbage salad makes for a good delivery vehicle of said sauce. Beautiful ambience, almost fine dining-like.

If everyone at the table gets a dish worth $9 or more then you get unlimited rice, miso soup, and salad. Which is great because their salad is so good as is their dressing and really gives your palate a break/reset from the deep fried foods that is your main meal. We got a side of curry because katsu and curry is just a perfect combination and if youve never poured curry over your katsu before, definitely recommend it!",

            "review_text": "One of the best restaurants I ve ever been to in my entire life. The food was phenomenal, presented beautifully, and the service was efficient and attentive. Each person gets 1 free miso and 1 free rice refill (meaning each person gets 2 misos and 2 rice bowls in total, at least when we were there). The food was so fresh, tasted delicious, and I don t think we had to wait too like despite it being quite busy. We ordered 1 rosu katsu ($25), 1 rosu curry ($28), and 2 cheese katsus ($26.50 for one order). Although this place is quite pricey, it s worth it for the experience and the quality and amount of food. The cheese katsu is quite rich, the rosu curry is quite flavourful, and the breading of all of the katsus were amazing! We highly recommend coming here, but DON T FORGET TO MAKE A RESERVATION/BE PUT ON THE WAITING LIST ONLINE, because it s super busy once it opens, and you ll have to wait 30+ minutes if you don t have one. Vegetarian options: Variety of food options Kid-friendliness: Lots of food options and kids can share the big portions",

            "review_text": "First of all, among all the restaurants Ive been to, this one can proudly claim to be the most courteous. Furthermore, I can confidently say it was the tastiest tonkatsu Ive ever had. The reason is that Ive tried over a hundred tonkatsu places, both famous ones in Korea and Japan, but while 90% had similar flavors, none of them were 100% friendly. Thats because the best places are usually too busy to be friendly. However, here, every staff member was exceptionally friendly. Even though I used basic Japanese instead of English, they treated me with utmost kindness. Among them, a staff member with slightly dyed white hair was fluent in Korean and provided excellent service. As a result, Im leaving this comment now. Even when I asked for extra vegetables or miso soup, they gladly provided them without any sign of inconvenience. Every staff member was genuinely, truly friendly and provided top-notch service, which is why I plan to visit frequently. If youre planning a trip to Japan, I highly recommend going here. Its a definite pass for Vancouvers best restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Other white fish I had before is very fluffy and light with a gentle sweetness to it. This one was briny only. Presentation of the food is great. Seating is wonderfully spacious. Service is quite attentive and friendly. All in all it was a very pleasant experience. Slightly on the expensive side. Kid-friendliness: High chairs and kids tableware",

Whenever I had it other places, I was comparing it with Saku My favorite is Tokujyo Rosu katsu( premium cut) with is light, crispy, juicy and tender.  The kaki fry- oyster is very good too. The Udon was the best. They serve very good  the miso soup (ton jiru) and finely shredded cabbage with the house sesame sauce unlimited. Very good service and the airy Morden interior is plus. They are very popular. They don t take reservations. If you don t want to wait go odd hours or weekdays.",

I ve been ordering the Ebi Hotate Katsu lately, deep fried breaded jumbo prawn and scallops  never disappointed. The salad dressing is AMAZING and the miso is yum too. Both unlimited?! THE BEST!

Even this was way too much food for the two of us and we ended up taking part of it home. We did get a side of curry and 1 deep fried oyster. Loved the oyster; could have done without the curry as it was literally just sauce, and very underwhelming sauce at that. I hear they get their crumbs from Cobs Bread, which would explain why the breading was so delicious. I look forward to going again.",

I shared a Zenbu Katsu and this can definitely feed three mildly hungry people. Everything was crisp, not greasy and moist on the inside. The curry from their curry katsu was delicious too. Their staff were also nice and very attentive. This is a definite must-try place if youre in the area...

They text you to tell you you re third in line if you re not already refreshing to check your spot, which is super convenient. Upon entering the restaurant, I found it to be super bright and clean with a beautiful open concept design and natural wood finishes and a touch of (fake?) plants. We were seated in a spacious booth with a QR code photo on the table as our menu. We ordered the hire and premium katsu, both which were tender and juicy with a super crispy crust! The set comes with rice, shredded cabbage (which tastes pretty delicious with the sesame dressing), miso soup, pickled veggies, sesame seeds with mortar and pestle for grinding and a a katsu sauce that reminds me of barbecue flavour. The set is beautifully displayed in a large wooden katsu tray making it look substantial and beautifully presented compared to other katsu places. The servers were constantly refilling our water and checking in; very attentive and I felt looked after. I also really liked the way our server explained that the premium pork might look pink inside but it s cooked and fine to eat. While I would ve eaten it anyway, it was a helpful and proactive reminder. Average price was $20-$23 per set but I would order and try the cheese katsu or even the larger zebu set next time (good for two people). I ll definitely be back!",

So she gave the run down on each dish as this is an immersive dining experience where you add your own salt, grind sesame seeds to add to a sauce and other garnishes and refillable sides. I loved it and loved the experience. It was quite bright inside otherwise loved the atmosphere. Being of North American heritage I wasnt sure if it was so we could see our beautiful food or if evening lights had not been dimmed yet. I will definitely be bringing anyone here who has not been before. Thank you!. Also, I had to leave in a hurry and asked for my bill while still eating. They brought the bill and  paid promptly. In todays lowered service quality this was nice to see good service again.",

It comes with unlimited rice, miso, and salad. Their salad dressing is my absolute favourite! I drown my salad, knowing its prob bad, but its so good. I tried my friends katsu nabe and i wasnt a fan. Personally, i wasnt a fan of the crispy tonkatsu drowning in soup. It was obviously starting to get soggy when i tried it, and i ate a piece as soon as it arrived to the table, so it was as fresh and piping hot as could be. She enjoyed it but i wouldnt order. Order it if you like soup and dont mind soggy meat though.",

Dont sleep on the shredded cabbage! It tastes amazing with their house dressing - I drown mine and always get thirds  . Make sure your whole party is there, or you wont get seated.

The breading is so crispy & crunchy and the pork was tender and fatty and hot and juicy and oh so perfectly cooked.

I even did the thing where I had to loosen my belt. It was all too good to stop eating. Saku is the pork cutlet category killer for sure. Ive never had one that can compare.",

The pork was so tender and juicy, it didnt feel overcooked at all! I wish there were more pieces given the price of $27. The curry tasted amazing, but the texture of the udon was mediocre - a bit too mushy for my taste, I prefer it more chewy. The best part is the unlimited salad, rice and miso soup. The miso soup or tonjiru is so flavourful, I had 3 bowls and still crave it. We poured the remaining curry sauce over the rice and it was another way to enjoy the meal. The salad was crisp and cold, really helped balance out the fried food. I also loved the pickles they served! We went on a Friday for lunch and didnt have to wait.

Im a stickler for over paying for food, but even at $32 after tip I was stoked with my meal. I ordered the Hire katsu with a cheese katsu side addition. The katsu pork is soft while the crunch is perfect, the rice freshly steamed and the simple cabbage salad just brings it all together. Whatever that sesame dressing for the coleslaw is, is absolute fire. When you take a bite of katsu dipped in the sauce, then a big bite of rice and cabbage... that is a perfect flavour profile. Also the cheese katsu was delish, I could ravage a lot of that. After three times being denied as it was too busy I finally got in and Ill definitely be back. Thanks SAKU!",

The restaurant is beautiful and bright, spacious but cozy, and decorated with warm wood throughout the space. The waiter was kind, respectful and detail oriented. The tray held your tonkatsu and an assortment of little condiments and side dishes. Each had its own role to constantly change up your eating experience and reinvigorate your taste buds to go in for another bite: juicy tender fatty pork with a crunchy exterior with a squeeze of citrus spark on top, thin crispy fresh cabbage, total body warming miso soup, a little salt to amplify your tastes, DIY freshly ground sesame seeds for a nutty, earthy tone mixed into the deep umami sauce vs the creamy and tart.. tartar sauce, pickles to cleanse your palate and cut the fat, and Japanese rice to bring everything harmoniously together. Not to mention the rice, cabbage and miso soup have unlimited refills? Ive never had tonkatsu like this before.",

            "review_text": "LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT SAKU!!!! I would highly recommend. In my reviews they mention how the rice, cabbage and miso soup is unlimited. You can opt out for udon for additional 4$ and you will still receive a serving of rice, which again is unlimited. For first time goers the servers are super nice and friendly, they will explain how to enjoy your meal. With the dressing being readily available at your table, it makes it easy to enjoy your meal. The atmosphere was very authentic to being in Japan. You have to wait outside the restaurant and there is a list to put your name. You are given the option to have a table to yourself or shared seating. Trust me when I say shared seating is not that bad, theres definitely enough space between you and the other party that its basically your own table! I loved how the dressing was at the table and theres the option between ponzo dressing and the sesame. I liked a mixture of both !! The katsu were super Crispy on the outside and moist (or super cheesy) on the inside. The pork was definitely still moist, which was great. The cheese katsu, I highly suggest that is super cheesy! Definitely had that cheese pull factor!!! Get an order of the Jumbo Prawn, you wont regret it. I also ordered a side of their curry, which was shared between two people and there was a lot left over! Meals average between 16-18$ and you can add additional katsu to try out ! I would highly recommend Saku to anyone. Prepare for a wait as the restaurant isnt that big. Its sooo good!!!!!!",

            "review_text": "Quite honestly one of the best restaurants Ive ever been to. First of all, the process to wait in line before getting a table is so smooth. All you have to do is register yourself in a virtual lineup, and they will notify you when you should be outside of the restaurant as a table opens up so that allows you to browse the area while you wait. We got to explore a bit before we got in which was nice. When we got there, we were seated within minutes. The employees are so informative and always ready to help you out. And the FOOD. I got the chicken katsu and oh my goodness - this breading cannot be replicated. It was crispy without being overly greasy and salty. They offer sauces on the side to add flavour to the degree of your choosing, which I can appreciate as someone who doesnt particularly love food drenched in sauce. To top it off, you get such an elaborate tray of food for just under $20 CAD - thats pretty impressive.",

That is one of my biggest things I care about in a restaurant, believe it or not. More places need to do this. Food is always high quality and delicious. Juicy and crispy katsu that is served with unlimited rice, unlimited salad, unlimited miso soup. I love the options for what to pair my katsu with.

            "review_text": "2021 update Saku has moved to a bigger location on Robson St. It is well-designed, bright, incredible aisle space between tables, many more tables and even private booths for larger parties on one side. Their COVID protocol is excellent, but I wish they would switch to a QR code and Google docs for collecting person contact information so we dont even have to touch a shared ballpoint pen. The first time we arrived at the new location, we were turned away because their wait list was already full for the lunch period. The good news is, they are using Yelp Food app which allows patrons to sign up for the wait list online. So, dont join a line when you get there. There are no lines. Once you are on the waitlist, Saku will text you when the table is almost ready. And, their menu has also been extended to include non-katsu items. 2019 I found this while looking at all the restaurants along Robson Street on Google Map. There was a line up when we arrived, the wait was around 30 minutes. Well worth it! We ordered Hire Katsu (breaded pork fillet) and Veggie Katsu (breaded tofu with vegetables). While they were both excellent, I think I will switch to the Vegetable Katsu next time because of the soft tofu. Its amazing how they can bread the soft tofu! The food comes on a tray with miso soup, rice, raw cabbage, pickles, Katsu sauce, mortar and pestle for grinding sesame seeds for the sauce, and lemon sea salt which I really like. The server explained everything to use, what sauce to use, and said that refills for soup, rice and cabbage is unlimited. The salad dressing for the cabbage is very delicious. They come around to offer refill for your soup bowl, and also refill of cabbage . The servers are very polite and courteous   real Japanese hospitality. It was an excellent experience. We will definitely come here again!",

It is better to order it only if you have two people and so you can order an extra set of rice. It is just way too much for one person. The table next to mine also couldnt finish it. The breading was nice and just enough. It tastes amazing when it is hot and you can feel the crispiness. The pork and chicken were moist. I actually loved the chicken more than the pork but overall, everything were amazing. You can also refill rice, salad and miso soup for free. The staffs were nice and I loved the design of the restaurant. It does feel very authentic. The price may be relatively higher but I will say it worth every penny. PS. You can actually smell the Katsu when you walk pass the restaurant. It just smells amazing. And like all good things, there is always a queue, so better to join the waitlist on Yelp.",

This new location looks fabulous, its got big booths as well as adjustable tables, waiter area in the center where they can keep an eye out for anybody hailing them, and even a patio area (that they have yet to utilize). The food here has always been good but now the menu has expanded to include everything that they have on the Broadway location and then some. The same endless sides of miso, rice and shredded cabbage are still there. And the variations can go from a different cut of meat to different flavors entirely and as long as you know what ton katsu is you wont be disappointed. The staff are great theyre attentive ready to offer you a new bowl of miso or whatever else, take the right amount of time to ask if youre ready to order and dont go hide in the back of house. Probably one of the most assured good experience restaurants that I can go to.",

Yes, there is going to be a very long wait but the wait was totally worth it for us. Food: Saku had the best Katsu Ive ever had anywhere. The coating was light and the meat inside was cooked perfectly tender. The flavors were so great. They also give you unlimited Miso Soup and Cabbage Salad - I could not get enough of the salad and their salad dressing - definitely got at least 2 refills of that at our table. We also got at least once refill of the Miso Soup. Dont forget to take advantage of the refills! I really wanted to get their sampler but I ended up getting the premium pork. My friend got the one with the curry and they were very impressed with the curry. You can get an extra side of curry so you can have some extra dipping sauce! Highly recommend a meal here if you are in the area. Just plan to wait a long time but be rewarded at the end! *Oh they were super concerned about allergies and made sure my friend wasnt eating anything she couldnt. They pulled out a whole ingredient list to double check!* Great service!",
