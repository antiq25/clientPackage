            "review_text": "We made a table reservation before we left the UK. This was our last meal in Vancouver before heading home. Given that it was a Sunday when we visited, this place was fully booked and upon arrival, we could see why. It is located by the harbour and the views out are fabulous. We had a table outside as it was a pleasant evening. Starters comprised of calamari and a Caesar salad, which we shared between us (the waiter plated up two half plates for us). For our mains we shared a seaside platter and a portion of truffle fries. We had 6 drinks over the course of the evening too. As I mentioned our wedding anniversary upon booking, we were gifted a lovely cake for dessert. Service was good given how busy they were. And the food was served hot and well presented. Total bill with taxes and grats $220, PS132",

            "review_text": "I brought my dog to Stanley Park for a walk today, and while passing by this unique-looking seafood restaurant with a harbor backdrop, I thought of buying some small dishes to take for a picnic. The restaurants staff said they usually dont do takeout, but she offered to inquire for me. Shortly after, a person who appeared to be the manager came out with a smile and asked me, What would you like to order? I ordered two appetizers, Signature Wok Squid and Fried Oysters. He also suggested that I could get a portion of steamed rice or fried rice to go along with them.I sat on a chair by the harbor and started tasting a few bites. Both the squid and oyster were very fresh, and the squid had a great flavor. Paired with white rice, it was just right. The dipping sauce for the fried oyster had a hint of orange sweetness, and it was delicious. I definitely need to go back to the restaurant, sit on that beautiful patio, and enjoy another seafood meal.",

We ordered the wok squid to start (in the picture) and it was a little spicy but had a nice Asian twist to the typical fried calamari you have at restaurants.

The service here is top notch, they are quick, attentive, and accommodating. They have been a staple for Vancouver for quite a while, so it s no surprise they are still doing well. Their appetizers are solid. Mains are a bit more expensive, but you do get a solid sized portion. Come for the view, the ambiance, and stay for a good bite and a couple of drinks. A good way to end off the day after exploring downtown Vancouver.",

I never mentioned it while reserving online but told the hostess in conversation on our way to our table. She mentioned it to our server Nick who went above and beyond to make sure we had a good time. His service was genuinely excellent and he recommended some great dishes. Between the table we tried the garlic prawns, albacore tuna, sablefish and the feature halibut and they were all great. I unfortunately only got pictures of the dessert cause they did it up nice for us. Dessert was also really good! It was a rainy day and the sun poked out just as we started eating and a rainbow appeared for a few mins. Such was a great evening :) Thanks Cardero! Thanks Nick!",

The glazed sablefish was absolutely delicious, I would definitely recommend and the sauce for the mussels was super yummy as well. Their garlic bread is underwhelming, but the brownie dessert was so good. It was the perfect combination of sweet and various textures, I would come back to try something else from this place.",

However you would still have to make a reservation ahead of time to make sure to have that table for tonight. Appetizers were great, and mussels sauce was a big pleasant surprise! Order one more piece of bread since you would not want this coconut sauce with special taste to go to waste! Mains were all great, as you can see in pictures, beautifully arranged and tasting great! Pork chop was very tasty. Another big pleasant surprise for a seafood restaurant. You will enjoy your visit to Cardero s !",

Kristy Lee was a fantastic server who accommodated various dietary preferences with a smile on her face. She genuinely seems to love her job which comes through in her service.

Quite a few appetizers and everything came out fast which was very nice. Sitting outside on the balcony was the way to go, I love that the restaurant is literally on the water which is a cool atmosphere. What I would keep in mind is parking which can be a hassle sometimes but there is a small parking garage nearby which doesnt cost too much money. Overall I recommend this place if you can ever get a reservation!",

This restaurant is very popular during the lunchtime rush, so coming a little later will give you a better experience. While busy, we enjoyed the service. The team still took the time to chat, handle our queries about wines, and move us to a window table when one became available spot-on service. The food was hearty, and we decided to share the battered fish and chips, a specialty main dish, which was delicious and tender without being too strong (so perfect for those seafood novices like hubhy). Whether you are inside or out, the views are breathtaking, and the decor fits in with the style of the building. Pricing is standard for Vancouver, based on the size of the meals you are best to share. The wine list was extensive, and we enjoyed a beautiful Monterey Pinot Noir with a 3.8 rating on Vivino.",

Katie was great, checked on us enough without harassing us and seem to show up at just the right moments.   The food was fantastic and certainly has us wanting to come back for more. Our 2 fave things today was the very meaty seafood chowder and the sablefish. Thanks Carderos for the amazing lunch.  Hopefully we get a chance to dine here again.",
