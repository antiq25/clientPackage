            "review_text": "Utterly confused why this clinic would receive anything less than five stars. Convenient location on the upper floor of Marine Gateway Hub. Operates Monday to Friday. Lovely and professional staff who remain patient, helpful and composed during this unusually difficult time. Our family is seen and treated by Dr Vasquez who has brilliant reviews on Rate My MD (not at all surprising). We have also seen Dr Cubra on occasion when Dr Vasquez has been away. Both doctors are incredibly patient, empathetic, and knowledgeable with relationships to other fantastic specialists in the community. Dr Vasquez is hardly ever late for an appointment - sometimes he is a few minutes early. On the rare occasion I have waited an additional 5-10 minutes but this is a far departure from our previous GP. I can t believe had become accustomed to waiting 1 hour + elsewhere. When this clinic moved into our neighbourhood a few years ago, I happened to ask the receptionist which doctor I should see and they told me that ALL of them were amazing. We have happily found this to be true!",

Here s what I love the most: - The interior design of the clinic is just beautiful. It feels very welcoming and is always super clean! - All the ladies at the reception are so lovely, patient and helpful. I find their service always friendly and I never feel rushed when booking an appointment or asking a question, even though they are very busy! - I use the walk-in clinic here and Dr. Cubra is absolutely amazing. He is the kindest doctor,  very patient, understanding, trustworthy and extremely knowledgeable. I never feel rushed and he always takes the time to listen to my symptoms and explain his recommendations. I truly believe he goes above and beyond for all the patients he sees. He has been an extremely huge help (especially this year) for me and I am so thankful for him and this clinic. The team at this clinic...they are the best! - I have never felt I had to wait an unreasonable amount of time, which is amazing for a walk-in clinic. And if they feel I have, they always apologize which just shows how thoughtful they are. Thank you so much, Marine Gateway MC. I so appreciate all you do for me and the other patients you see.",

            "response_from_owner_text": "Hi Alexander, Perhaps there was some confusion on your part about how our earlier exchanges transpired, so please allow me to provide some clarity. You initially requested a weekend appointment a few months ago, and we were, unfortunately, unable to accommodate your ask as it fell outside our hours of operation. I did, however, still help you the best I could by locating another clinic near you as an alternative. Your request and my subsequent email correspondences occurred during a brief period when we experienced difficulties with our email server, something for which I apologized for at the time. As I am sure you know, it is an unfortunate reality that technology does not always work the way we expect it should despite our best efforts. When you spoke with my colleague last week requesting an appointment, she informed you of our clinic policy which requires new patients to present to the clinic by walk-in for their first visit. I am afraid you may have confused these two different exchanges, which occurred nearly eight months apart, as one occurrence, one of which was not your own. Nevertheless, I feel it is important to offer insight into any misconceptions you may still have about how a medical clinic, specifically our clinic, operates so that you are better informed in the future when trying to access care. The foundation of a walk-in clinic operates on the principle that a patient may present to a clinic without an appointment to access urgent or time-sensitive medical care on the same day. This concept will cease to exist in its practical sense if there is an expectation that clinics should schedule appointments in advance. Moreover, scheduling appointments ahead of time in a walk-in setting will make it extremely difficult for patients in need of urgent care to receive timely care. With that said, we also recognize that,  for a number of people, an appointment system is more ideal due to personal or professional commitments. For this reason, we operate as a hybrid by offering both walk-in and appointment services so that we may better accommodate everyone. To ensure we can accomplish this successfully, a number of different policies have had to be implemented to organize how and when each service can be rendered. One such policy is that new patients are required to present to the clinic by walk-in for their first appointment. This allows us to validate a new patients information, and ensure they are adequately informed of our clinic policies. While we acknowledge that not everyone will be agreeable to this caveat, it has ultimately allowed us to increase access to care for patients by drastically reducing our no-show rate so we may use resources, such as physician time, more efficiently. Therefore, although we are a business and some of our policies may not always equate to good business acumen, we feel it would be unethical to compromise the quality of care and access to medical services by operating as though healthcare is about commerce rather than the health and well-being of people. I hope the information above can help you understand the events that lead up to your experience, but should you need further clarification for our clinic procedures, I would be happy to address your concerns, so please do not hesitate to contact me. Kind regards, Marjan Amiri, Management for Marine Gateway Medical Clinic",

I paid a fee out-of-pocket to the incorrect company and have had to go through multiple rounds of back-and-forth with multiple people. Now, my personal medical information is in the hands of a third-party that it should never have gone to and I have to pay even more money on top of what I already paid, to fix an error that is not my doing. When I called the clinic to report this issue, they admitted that it was their mistake, but did not apologize and essentially told me I was out of luck and would have to just solve it myself.",

They expect you to think of everything. But its okay if you dont realize something may go wrong, because they would say its your fault for not double checking with them.

So, I still asked if there is any online booking system or something. She said I can call 9.45am and book via phone. next day I called her and she said no booking for walkin over phone.
