Bunch of choice of cheap chain restaurants to choose from in this underground food court. But the young man working here at WE GRILL saw me looking at their menu and totally sold me what I wanted. A nice plate with freshly cooked and tasty food. I had the number 3 beef/chicken mixed with teriyaki hot sauce. Good job guys! It was a good lunch! Thanks.",

The ingredients were fresh and the staff were friendly. The cost was extremely fair considering the quality of the food. The taste was sensational. AND THE BEST PART he got my husband to eat his vegetables after suggesting plate #3 when he couldnt decide what he wanted to try! That alone was well worth the stop. This place definitely earned 5 stars. Thank you so much We Grill. We look forward to visiting again when we come back and will be telling all our family and friends in the Yukon about your amazing food. However , I dont know how Ill now convince the other half to eat his vegetables now he found someone who cooks them better than me.",

            "review_text": "I recently had the pleasure of dining at We Grill, located in the Waterfront Center Food Court near the Pinnacle Harbourfront Vancouver. We Grill specializes in freshly made veggie samosas, and they are absolutely delicious. The person working at the We Grill stall was friendly and welcoming, which made for a pleasant dining experience. I had the opportunity to try their veggie samosas, which were crispy on the outside and filled with a flavorful mixture of potatoes and spices on the inside. They were simply amazing and left me wanting more. I also had the chance to taste their fries, which were equally as delicious as the samosas. They were crispy and perfectly seasoned, making for a great side dish to the samosas. Overall, I would highly recommend We Grill to anyone looking for tasty and authentic Indian cuisine in Vancouver. The freshly made veggie samosas and fries are a must-try, and the friendly staff make for a welcoming and enjoyable dining experience. Thank you to the staff at We Grill for a great meal.",

When he learned we were going to the local suspension bridge, he dug around in his register and gave us two free tickets. And watching him with other customers he was as kind to all. 6 stars",

Their customer service is top notch as well. Locally owned hidden gem! Kudos to the young funny guy that really sells it and convinced me to try this place. Will be back for sure to try their breakfast menu. On a side note I love that they give you the option of adding fried onions to your bowls as much as you want!!!",
