I enjoy their variety of burgers and fries. The prices are very reasonable and they often have great deals. The restaurant is always clean and the staff is always friendly. I also like that they offer a variety of healthy options like salads and fruit smoothies. I also appreciate that they offer a drive-thru option so I can get my food quickly.

She was the second manager I talked to and was understanding. The first one I talked to told me to hold and passed me over to Brandon. Brandon did a good job of understanding what the situation was. Ps: Sorry if I spelled your name wrong Ps: To the other manager if you see this I hope you learn stuff Ps: I give 5 stars to the manager not to the store for she did the right thing at the right time My parents always get told off because they cant understand people and today there was something wrong with the order in which they actually give a coupon and showed the cashier what they wanted but they did the wrong order and was quite rude about not changing it for them.(they did in the end but it was still more expensive when they asked for a different burger) My parents told me when they got home. And I was livid with this happening at McDonald when they should be trained better then anyone. I know for a fact there training for staff is great so dont know where customer service went with some of the people in the store!!!",
