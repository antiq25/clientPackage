I have been nothing but happy with the professionalism and detail of work shown by both Jade and Julie. I regrettably took him somewhere else for his last groom, a mistake which I will not be making again. I will be back to Petsmart for his next full groom before we move cities. Thank you!",

At home we put the scratching pole in front of our sofa, so the cat can see us watching her scratching and amazingly! - she started scratching it right away to please us!

Tony is a real mamas boy but she made him feel special and he allowed her to cut his hair and nails without biting her. this is always a plus as I do hate it when blood is drawn. However, she did a great job, he looks simply fab, and he is only slightly upset by the ordeal. Thank you Sarah. You are a groomer extraordinaire for my nervous little dog with extreme separation anxiety.",
