The Captains Boil sauce is soooo finger-licking good (a tad too salty but still yummy nonetheless) and all the seafood we selected were fresh and cooked just nice. Besides the corn being too soggy to our liking, everything else was on point. Obviously the two of us could only manage half of the feast and had to pack the rest home. Its our first time here and we were guided by the nice servers how to order. Will be back for sure.",

The portions are BIG, the flavor is spectacular.  Loved the lobster, mussels, shrimp, veggies, rice, chicken, fries. The energy was fun - music playing, guests enjoying their food.

            "review_text": "Captain Boil is a big franchise seafood restaurant. It has more than 30 restaurants across Canada in different cities. There are five locations in the Great Vancouver area. I have been to the two locations before: one is on Robson St. Downtown and another one is on Kingsway Vancouver. Both of the locations served quite delicious seafood. Very enjoy eating at Captain Boil. Captain Boil Kingsway Location is at 3309 Kingsway, Vancouver, BC V5R 5K6. The same as Robson St. location, is a super busy street in Vancouver. Many restaurants are on the street. Such a great location to open a restaurant on this street. I have been to this location twice with my friends and fiances. The first time was all you can eat Mussels night. The second time was lunch combo. For all you can eat Mussels dinner, three of us had 2lbs mussels each plus fries. It was awesome. The big plastics bags were full of fresh seafood. Yummy! Captain Boil s Lunch combo is another great combination. Fish or Chicken Teriyaki with rice with Seafood Assortments (2 Crawfish, 2 Mussels, 2 Shrimps, and 2 Clams). The total is only $13, which is such a great deal. Super hot rice with teriyaki sauce on top is super delicious. Definitely, we should go back to Captain Boil again.",

We ordered Captains platter #3 (cant remember the name, because I wasnt the one paying the bill!), 2 lbs of crayfish, okra, fish & chips, and platter comes with Cajun seafood fried rice. Each protein with different sauces. Everything is delicious, even the Cajun fries!! I like the garlic sauce the best. THE CAJUN SEAFOOD FRIED RICE have SCALLOPS too and not mentioned on the menu!!!! The scallops were not added to the fried rice after telling our server about fatal allergy to scallops, so everyone can eat enjoy the fried rice drizzled with the yummy sauces. Will definitely eat at Captains Boil again!!!",

The food was great if not a little salty but it was fun.  Everything you order comes out in plastic bags and is just plopped down in front of you.  You have plastic gloves on so that you can minimize the amount of sauce that you get on your hands.  The only thing that I might be concerned about is the large amount of plastic bags that they go through before every group.  Definitely not an environmental friendly place. Maybe they use bags that are biodegradable.  If they do, they should really market that better.",

At the time, when I used to live around the area for several years, my family and I thought the food was legendary and we would eat there at least once a month. However, when my family and I moved to Canada and discovered this place, we were blown away at how much more delicious the food was. When we vacationed at California and tried out the Boiling Crab restaurant, there was a sharp difference in quality. Captains Boil truly is amazing. Their food is beyond legendary.",

You should try the captains boil sauce, its superb!   And lastly, make sure to make reservations, theres a crowd!",

Fresh and extremely tasty food, very friendly and helpful staff, great prices, fun atmosphere and decor, good for large groups or small intimate meals. If youve never been, theres no cutlery or dishware, food arrives bagged and everything is an amazing hands on experience. They provide bibs and gloves if youre concerned about splatters etc, and snips and claw crackers to break open the legs and claws. The Captains Boil flavour is the best, and omg the Cajun fries. Havent had a Dungeness crab in years, but I devoured every tasty morsel with a huge grin on my face, wrist deep in sauce, and licking them clean every chance I got. Definitely worth a try if youve never been and love seafood!",
