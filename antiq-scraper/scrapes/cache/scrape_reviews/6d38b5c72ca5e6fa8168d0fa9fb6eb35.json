            "review_text": "@ Tom Brown, Well, you have to consider the fact that you LIVE in an 8 story building that only HAS one elevator. Maybe also consider the fact that elderly and handicapped people are living in the top floors of a single elevator unit. Fact is, over 50% of all these buildings have never modernized their elevators, and all parts required have not been produced for over 20 years. Ever heard the term passing the buck? Thats what your building owners are doing. Yup, when older elevators go down...they STAY down for a long time...and there are plenty of reasons why. All parts come from the states and Europe, and since American Homeland Security prohibits any dropships to Canada for large companies such as Otis...your parts turn from overnight delivery to several days at best. Then consider that Otis has to deal with hundreds and hundreds of these out-of-date elevators where parts are non-existant and incorporate how many tech crews are available to get to the time-critical ones. Then consider the fact that all mechanics are unionized and work at their own pace. So you asked why doesnt Otis work the wknds?...maybe direct your question to LOCAL 82 and ask them why. Its horrible to be without an elevator...YES, but you have toss the blame where it really lies...and thats with building owners who dont want to pay the money to bring their units into the current century.",

They never show up to fix it when they say there going too and the people they do send dont look or act professional in and way. and reading all the past reviews in not sure how this company is still in business.

(That is, we have had no elevator for over a month now.)  Our building manager has been unable to get any news from Otis.  Initially, we were told it would take about a week to fix it.  Then another week.  Then Otis said they would come on Monday, and simply didnt show up for a week.  They evidently dont work on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays. here are elderly people in the building who are missing their doctors appointments, and who dont like being unable to go out for over a month.  I have phoned Otis Canada a few times, but have never been able to get any information.  My wife has cancelled 8 physiotherapy appointments. (so far!)  Now the long weekend is coming up (Labour Day), people would like to move out. One person wanted to move out 2 weeks ago.  He cant, because theres no elevator.  I find it extremely odd that Otis will not work for double or triple overtime or whatever.  I have sent the main office (not the Vancouver office) 3 emails, which they cannot be bothered to acknowledge, it seems; there is not even an automated reply.  I phoned the Vancouver office just now - put on hold, and then transferred to a different number, which didnt answer.  I phoned the Vancouver office again, and there was no answer.  We have had no information at all from Otis for about 2 weeks now. Its incredible, really - there are about 60 apartments in this building, and no one knows when the elevator will be repaired, or even if it will be repaired ever.",

Clearly the almighty dollar is the only thing that drives this company. Their stuff is proprietary and they wont let anyone else service the elevator programming, give me a break. Welcome to the 21st century Otis ownership, Too Big, Too Fat, old guys in leadership not aware of how this could play for them online we have a voice!!! I hear Richmond elevator is eating them alive with customer service and fair pricing. Merry Christmas to the ownership.

An hour later I was still stuck in the elevator with my 2 small children and had to call the fire department to come and help me.

A persons life is on steak and this company takes no action to resolve elevator ptoblems. Seems like we are not living in Canada but a third world country where ppl life or time has no importance.
