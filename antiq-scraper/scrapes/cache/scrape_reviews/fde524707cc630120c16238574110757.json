One part of the kitchen has a window where you can see the dumplings being freshly made. Note: the wonton come with 10 pieces, we already tried 2 before I decided to take a picture. We are definitely coming back for more!",

            "review_text": "By far the best soup dumplings I have ever had! I always have to order another order because they are that good! You also know it s gonna be good when you can see them make them the dumplings right in front of you! I have been here many times already and their food does not disappoint. I got the Steamed Pork Buns (Xiao Long Bao/Soup Dumplings), Pan Fried Pork Buns, Pan Fried Dumplings and Beef Roll! I would recommend everything because it was really affordable and yummy. The soup from the Steamed and Fried Pork Buns was really flavourful! The Pan Fried Dumplings had a lot of filling and isn t like other dumplings I ve had at other restaurants (which are sometimes frozen). You have to get the Beef Roll, I love the amount of meat, cucumbers and sauce there is in it! Another thing I like is how they have chili oil and vinegar at the table for you! I can t wait to come back and try their noodles and wontons,unfortunately it was too hot for that today.",

It s just a small hole in the wall, short menu but focused on what they do best, delicious dumplings. Low prices are a plus too. With just a few tables, it gets crowded very fast. It s definitely worth the wait. I m amazed at how much volume they can put out in such a small kitchen, but the staff are really efficient.  My favourites are the pan fried pork buns and pan fried dumplings.  There s a new item in the menu, Shanghai mini wontons but there s nothing mini about them.  The seaweed in soup broth adds a different twist that s a bit like a fusion of Japanese flavours.  I be coming back regularly Drop me a comment or a like if you found this helpful.",

The service was quick and fairly friendly (typically of what youd see in an American fast food joint) possibly better if you are just as respectfully- they are humans. We ordered dumplings, mini buns ( fried - sweet) and Dan Dan. The food was quick!! And the flavors complex, fresh and definitely a steal for the prices. I would highly recommend this place if you want fresh quick fast-food/takeout, that is made in front of your eyes and has great flavor for a great price.",

Although theres no meat in this noodle dish I always order it with a side of beef roll so i still get the meat i crave. The XLBs are soupy and hot and the pan fried buns are nice and crispy. I love the fried rice cakes. Although the colour is a little bland the taste is still very prominent.",

I ve been here many times and always ordered the xiao long baos.  I d say it s best in town as the skin is thinnest of all the places I ve tried. The Szechuan beef noodle is good as well.  The pic here is of the pork chop noodles. Simple broth and tasty meat. The only thing I don t like is that they put the pork on the noodles so they get soggy quickly. It d be better if they came on a separate plate. The pan fried pork buns are amazing. Very juicy inside and the buns are soft and fluffy. I ve also tried the green onion pancake and they re good as well. These don t taste as  homemade  but good nonetheless.  Usually busy but wait times go fast. Worth the wait anyway.",

Only downside is that my toddler is sensitive to MSG (his face gets red blotches) and definitely saw it eating here. Anything dumpling like probably has it. Will come back to explore other things on the menu! Steamed pork buns (Xiao long bao) - top notch. Perfect. Pan fried pork buns - amazing! So juicy. Cold wontons with peanut sauce - they were pleasantly warm, it says spicy but it was only slightly spicy. The sauce tastes good but unappetizing looking. Beef rolls - great Shanghai noodles - good Bean paste noodle (ja Jiang mian) - good Boiled dumplings - pretty plain. More cabbage than I expected. Fried green onion pancake - ok. Dan Dan noodle - good but wouldnt order again. It is just noodle, sauce and some green onions. I expect at least something else in it.",

We got everything out of our meal that you could hope for from a small Shanghai dumpling restaurant. The prices are great and its a bit hard to believe the value you are getting. They clearly have the approach of having a limited menu but making sure every item is a winner. My wife, daughter and I really enjoyed trying this place out. I would recommend ordering out since their restaurant space is pretty small. Half of the total space is kitchen staff cranking out their dumplings and noodles. Just be super clear if youre ordering in English because I had the unfortunate circumstance happen where I ordered 12 pork dumplings and showed up to find 12 ORDERS of pork dumplings ready for pickup.",

I always get the pork dumplings in chili sauce, and layer on the chili sauce they have at the table too. Only thing is that this place isnt really vegetarian friendly.

The pork chop rice and pan fried are also good. The green onion pancake is tasty too but a bit on the greasy side for me!",
