            "review_text": "Ive been using The Maids service for years on and off. They have never once let me down or ever provided less than excellent service. The team that shows up is always very professional, personable and kind. And dealing with Bruce or the assistant managers is always a pleasure. They are extremely accommodating to any needs I may have. For instance, I have two kittens, who started off with poor health. Working with Bruce and the team we tried different schedules or breaks and approaches that created a minimal stress environment for the cats, which mean everything to me. In general, I try to stay up to date on cleaning myself, but after years of degrading back pain, knowing I can rely on The Maids to pick up my slack and keep my apartment looking amazing is a huge relief. Im extremely grateful when I come across businesses that deliver above and beyond expectations. Thank you for years of quality service Services: Standard cleaning , General housekeeping , Deep clean",

Bruce is very personable and detailed with his communication- I knew exactly what I was paying for. Every spot in the apartment was up to expectations and the equipment/products used were also of great quality. Additionally, because both my husband and I work from home, I was very happy that it only takes 45 minutes since they send a team of 4. Very great company to work with when you want consistent and efficient communication and quality of work! Looking forward to continuing using The Maids of Vancouver :)",

A whole team shows up, always punctual, with all their own equipment and never disappoint. The cleaning equipment and products are all high quality. I have bad allergies to most things but have never once been irritated by the products. Theyre highly efficient and thorough and easily the most professional cleaning company Ive used in Vancouver. The management is also super approachable and flexible and make me feel like my needs are put first. When I have had a couple of minor (VERY MINOR) issues with particular service for example all efforts were made to rectify them immediately, including a discount. Couldnt be happier with The Maids!

Frankly, theres nothing more important to me than knowing these folks arent treated poorly. Weve had these cleaners coming by since the fall and theyve been great. They show up almost universally on-time or early, clean the place thoroughly (I can see myself in the tile), and theyre all very friendly. The price is good too my partner and I due to the pandemic didnt have to pay for 2 zone bus passes anymore and that was more than enough to pay for 1 visit a month for our 850~ sq foot low-junk apartment in the burbs. We were happy enough with the service that we upped it to 2 visits and thats enough to keep this place in great shape. Theyve been great about the restrictions and so have we, they work in the bedrooms and we go to the living room, they finish in there and we swap so they can do the rest of the place, windows open, air circulating! We can do 2m in the apt no problem. Thank you so much Areli and your team for making our time during the pandemic so much more enjoyable and our space so much more livable! This might be my favourite bill to pay! Service: Standard cleaning",

The team of 3 came out and very graciously listened to my mom s requests and started right away. We had to leave to go to hospital so we weren t able to see the completed job. When we returned home there were a couple things missed. We contacted Bruce again and he was more than happy to abide by the company s 24 hour policy. He himself came out the next morning with one of his staff and completely redid everything along with the couple things missed. The job was immaculate and very professional. I highly recommend The Maids for your cleaning needs. Thank you again Bruce for being so understanding and professional it s very much appreciated",

At that time the manager or team supervisor communicates more specific information on how long it will take to provide a professional, quality clean and can always customize the service to best meet your cleaning and budget needs.
