They have a sign on ground floor says it s opened, however, there s no sign on second floor, so we kind of feel lost and don t know where it is. Once we went up to third floor, we found the restaurant and everything is so amazing! They have a really Japanese style interior decoration which is cute and aesthetic. We ordered 3 combos and every food is tasty! Really recommend the royal bento, it s $30 but you got to try so many dishes! Will definitely recommend to others and come back!",

All the dishes are reasonably priced and even on the cheaper end. I really loved the blend of flavors in the cool eggplant and the black cod was so fatty and tender and generously portioned! I also really enjoyed my melon drink and ice cream, very creamy and refreshing. Service was nice and very fast, we couldve been in and out in 45 minutes with how fast the kitchen was, although we ate a bit earlier during dinner when it wasnt as busy, the speed was still rather impressive.",

This was my second time visiting and they rebrand the restaurant from Guu to the current one. The ambience is still nice like previously. You order from your phone and they bring it to your table. Not a huge fan of needing to pay and tip before eating tho. The food itself was unique and flavorful. You cant find some of their dishes from other sushi store/Izakaya. We ordered pork neck, fish collar bone, roasted cauliflower, karage and mackerel pressed sushi. The pork neck and beer tonge were amazing. The karage had crunchy skin and the inside was tender and juicy. Definitely recommend checking this place out.",

            "review_text": "Amazing experience at Haraheri last night! We went on a Friday and we were helped immediately. The restaurant has a cute rooftop vibe and the inside is quite cozy. What I was impressed by, however, was their great level of service and AMAZING, authentic japanese food. The tuna tataki was divine - garlic chips added a nice twist. Chicken karaage was yummy too. The best part of my night was the cajun salmon aburi/oshi - it literally melted in your mouth and the flavours worked perfectly. Absolutely loved it. Staff was extremely friendly & prices were reasonable considering Covid! I will definitely be returning. :)",

            "review_text": "Come on by for rooftop patio dining @guuharden.  The tables are socially distanced and the weather was perfect for dining outside in May 2021.  I really liked the garden around the patio which reminds me of Japan. Its the 2nd time Ive seen this system at a restaurant, ordering from your smartphone.  Such a great system to use to minimize contact as well, I am sure it helps the staff with orders going. straight to the kitchen. We both order the lunch Royal bento box and was delighted my it arrived.  Everything looked appetizing with bright colours and organized placement in the bento box with attention to detail. The Royal bento box includes: - 3 kinds of sashimi - ebi mayo - chicken and cauliflower karaage - ingren fries - bang bang e salad - saba shima sushi - grilled fish - vegetable kobachi - miso soup. My favourite were the fresh sashimi, specifically salmon and scallops.  They both melted in the mouth and you knew they were fresh.  The rest of of the items, honestly was also delicious.  The shrimp was super big and juicy in the ebi mayo.  The chicken was boneless and super moist and crunchy on the outside.  I enjoy vegetables with the bang bang e salad, cauliflower karaage and vegetable kobachi.  I was wasnt able to finish as I was quite full.  My husband gladly finished the rest of mine. If you havent tried Guu Garden, you must!  Support local by dining in (patio) or pickup/delivery.",

The entire restaurant feels like a rooftop patio (half of which is actually a rooftop patio). Even when youre inside, it almost feels like youre outside because of the wall to ceiling sliding glass doors. The staff were also super friendly. They had a great big smile as they welcomed us into/ushered us out of the restaurant. The food was delicious and prompt. I can recommend the Chicken Karage, the duck breast, Nasu Agebitashi, Bang Bang G Salad, and the Sake Sangria. Great spot to enjoy a nice summer day with friends and good eats.",

It s got a bit of drama when you walk up the steps to their entrance. I ve come here for both dinner and lunch but come here more often for lunch. Their lunch menu is sooooo good. I ve had all their lunch specials and my favorite is the steak one. You can add the egg to it as well as a slightly larger portion of steak, if you re feeling super hungry. The normal one is pretty generous and comes w rice, soup, pickled veggie, and salad. their izakaya one is also really good and my second favorite, as that one offers nice variety. Price is not bad for downtown sushi set lunches. they do have $10 rice bowls as well. So a good range of items depending how much you want to spend.",

We got six regular size plates and whew, they really hit all the right notes. I have a particular fondness for all things uni, so the baby scallop and uni cream croquette was just icing all over a very moist cake. We also ordered pork cheek, miso calamari, nankotsu, agedashi tofu and black cod kama. Presentation of each dish is pleasing, considering theyre mostly small fried plates, and they came out at a decent speed. Gotta say, nothing I didnt like at this place. Its not mind blowingly good, but they do everything so solidly its hard not to give them a 5.",

At the end of the night, we just put it on one bill, but I appreciated the owners patience for all the multiple questions I had. When we got there, I realized I forgot to mention that we wanted to sit outside, but since there were open tables, they gladly accommodated us. The outdoor space was beautiful and didnt feel like we were downtown, but on a rooftop little oasis. The food and drinks came out at a wonderful pace, without over crowding the table but not too slow where we were waiting too long either. There were too many dishes to name, but the stand outs were the tuna tataki, salmon oishii, beef tongue in broth with rice, grilled beef tongue, mentaiko pasta, tako wasa and salmon sashimi. We were having such a good time I forgot to take pictures. The staff here are amazing, so nice and we never felt rushed.",

As soon as we entered, we were greeted with loud welcomes from all the staff and seated prompt. The seating where you had to take off your shoes had foot warmers there to keep you warm in the colder winter days. Super nice. The staff would shout orders from right next to you to the bar if needed, so expect that when coming. :) There were a lot of Winter specials when we came and the prices were really fair for the portion. Beef tartar was one of our specials (amazing flavor, nice tender cuts that werent chewy at all). The uni and scallop croquette was nicely fried with such a rich filling. I was looking forward to finally having aburi, so I ordered the salmon off of the original menu. Nice sear on the salmon that complemented the seasoned rice, topped with warm, earthy, slightly spicy spices. So, so good. The mackerel was also really tasty, with a nicely salted fish and seasoned rice. Overall, all of the other dishes were really tasty and I enjoyed everything. The fried cheesecake ice cream was also very tasty, nothing much else like it that I ever had. Highly recommend!",

Everything is excellent with the exception of Kama which is on the sweet side but still enjoyable. Portion can be regular or small on some dishes. We had the regular.
