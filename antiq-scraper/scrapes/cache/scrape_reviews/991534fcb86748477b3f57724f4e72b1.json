Then, I tried it on a warm croissant - which reminded me of a cream cheese taste - just a little bit more acidic than a regular cream cheese. Which is also not a bad thing in my opinion.

I purchased two charcuterie packages to share at small gatherings this Chrismas season and it blew everyone away. Words alone cannot express how delicious it is.

I first discovered them at the Vancouver Famers Market and was instantly impressed by the taste, texture and quality of their dips and spreads. The cultured cashew base is tangy and smooth, and all their flavour combinations are well balanced. I particularly like the jalapeno and truffle varieties. Their cilantro dip is awesome too. Spread Ems chef is always coming up with new offerings like olive oil and herb marinated vegan soft cheeses and a Philly-style cream cheeze that quickly became my new favourite (it is divine on sourdough toast with sliced tomato and cucumber).

We opened two right away and loved them both, but the third one I wasnt really looking forward to because I didnt think Id like it.   OMG!  I AM IN LOVE!  The flavours worked perfectly together and it turned out to be my favourite!  I savoured every last bit of it and though its long gone now, and not available where I live, I still think about how lovely it was and how wrong I was to think I wouldnt like it. The cheese Im speaking of is the Apricot, Chili and Basil one! Please dont ever discontinue this cheese.  My son has instructions to buy  more of your cheeses, that one in particular, whenever he comes to visit and I asked a few friends to look for it if they are in a place that might have it.  Alas, nothing yet, but I dream about slathering your lovely cheese on a piece of fresh baked bread some day soon I hope. Thank you so much for creating such fabulous products.

If we didnt know it wasnt dairy, wed have probably thought it was. Its soo creamy, and has such a good balance of cheesy flavour. Its also a great texture, nice for spreading on things, having with crackers, etc. I highly recommend it! :)",

I am not remotely vegan or plant based - I *enthusiastically* eat meat and cheese - and I enthusiastically eat this stuff! The garlic and chive flavour tastes just like Boursin - you cant tell the difference. I was a bit reluctant to try some of the flavours (carrot chilli...?) but I have yet to be disappointed. Some spreads are sharp and tangy, some are smooth and a bit sweet, all are very flavourful and beautifully balanced. You can find them in many smaller grocery stores, but if you find them at the farmers market you pay $18 for three tubs - a huge savings over what youd pay in a store. And if you dont think youll finish them all (you will) they freeze beautifully. I cant say enough about these spreads. Go eat them now!",
