First; the lady at the front desk  was bored or tired attitude -to be nice with her- I guess you can improve customer service. Second; the inspection was very poor or the mechanics maybe were not interested in my car -I was told just to change the battery and I know my van need more work to do- what a difference with Canadian tire at marine way. I took another Van next day to Canadian tire at marine way and the feedback about my van was wayyyy better.  Hope this will help to improve your customer service.",

            "review_text": "This happened (July 3 @ 12:12pm) and my experience was horrible and beyond shocked how rude, immature and VERY unprofessional the employee I was talking to from this store in the AUTOMOTIVE department.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS STORE. This store do not even deserve 1 star after having that conversation with that horrible human being. I am about to purchase over a thousand dollar set of tires online for my vehicle and called the AUTOMOTIVE service and see how much would they charge for tire change. Whoever answer that call from AUTOMOTIVE department must be fired if Canadian Tire DONT wanna lose future loyal customers. I can guarantee that HE do not care about Canadian Tire as a company as he do not care about me trying to spend over a thousand dollars for this store. I am just trying to ask some legitimate questions and just want 30 seconds of his time but he chose to hang up on me for he said he is busy. I was even polite to ask him to please bear with me as I am looking for the correct information of my car to avoid confusion but he instead just hang up like a CHILD who has TEMPER TANTRUMS. If He don t care about me who is about to spend over a thousand dollars to  bring business to the company in exchange for 30 seconds of his paid time by the Canadian Tire, I m wondering how he treat those customers who spend less than that. To the extremely RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL person who answered my call, my TIME is as precious as your time SIR! If you do not wish to answer legitimate questions from customers then clearly youre in the wrong business and if you hate getting calls then QUIT YOUR JOB to spare Canadian Tire an embarrassment and losing business for having YOU. You are dragging down some good employee from this store and that how selfish of you. Mopping floor as a job do not require answering calls from customers just to give you an idea. Im wondering how the elders are treated when they call this store and you happen to be on the other line. To the executive officers and Shareholders of Canadian Tire who are reading this,  youre setting your bar really really low for having this horrible PERSON representing your company. I am a loyal Canadian Tire customer and now I will also cancel my triangle Mastercard. I will promise not to bring business to this company EVER. I know it doesnt affect that much in your business but I will spread words to every person I know that is trying to bring business with Canadian Tire in the future. I already filed a complaint at the head office and Im hoping its not too late for the company to address this issue before losing another loyal customers.",
