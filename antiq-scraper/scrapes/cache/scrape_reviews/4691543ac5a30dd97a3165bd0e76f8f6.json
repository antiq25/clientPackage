Whenever I ve come here for whatever product I find the staff very helpful, the prices are much cheaper than other places and they have a huge selection. Now that the garden works store in North Vancouver is closed I came here and discovered that they have the BEST  prices on their huge selection of pots, flowers, soil etc. They do need to change their entrance though. For those with disabilities it s a huge pain to go all the way around to one entrance. It makes more sense to have multiple entrances to welcome people into the store.",

This branch is a mini store because the local authority doesnt allow them to sell lumber, drywall etc.  However they still have most things. Of great importance is the quality of the team.  Matt is a man with no hair but he has a million good qualities of a gentleman and delivers exceptional customer service.  He walks and talks like a member of the Royal family.  Heiter is a kind and attentive  cashier who is mindful and caring for the company. Salvatore knows everything about everything in construction,  or it appears that way to customers.  He helps and guides equally well in tools, electrical, plumbing, tiling.  Its a pleasure to meet him. Thank you Home Depot.",

Centrally located at the Main Street intersection across from Simons, Home Depot - Park Royal carries a comprehensive array of quality products for all aspects of your home renovations conceived, and yet to be imagined. Update:  20th July 2022 Seasonal Outdoor Garden Centre: Home Depot at Park Royal Village has an Outdoor Garden Centre (open approx. early-April - September) which is located behind the store building.  Ample parking is available, in addition to carts for loading up flowers, plants, ceramic pots and supplies. I hadnt made a visit to H.D. Garden Centre since before Covid struck 2 years ago, but needed to replace an area of flower bed in back garden which had been planted, but which slugs had completely obliterated. The July Clearance has already begun but there are still very good quantities of ornamental Annuals, Perennials and Shrubs as well as a wide array of supplies (e.g., soil, fertilizer, slug bait [ yes, lol ;) ], patio ceramic pots and more) to be had. Awesome location, top-notch store and people. Highly recommended.",

I called the store last Friday, Faye took the call and the cartridge was out of stock, so she said she will follow up with me when the cartridge is in. Surely, she notified me about the cartridge availability 6 days later. So I picked up the cartridge the same day, in talking to her at the store, I found she is also very knowledgeable about the products. Faye demonstrated true excellent customer service in going an extra mile for me. I recommend her and home depot store at West Vancouver. Thank you, Faye!",

Only complaint is the parking lot fills up fast during prime mall time.",

I also noticed that everyone on that day was helpful. An employee named Telis (maybe spelt wrong) was really knowledgeable about patio cleaners.

Their politeness and willingness to share their expertise is exceptional, and Im so glad to have the benefit of a facility like this to hand.  Lately its been Rose and Frank and Scott, but in fact Ive only ever met with goodwill and helpfulness by all the staff Ive encountered there.  (Sorry - hope this isnt over the top!)",
