            "review_text": "I d like to give a huge thank you to Fraserview Hall for going above and beyond to host my Haldi and Reception events. Working with Fraserview was extremely easy and the staff prioritize their customers and truly want you to have the best experience. The hall itself is a stunning venue with chandeliers throughout the hall, a massive elevated dancefloor, modern carpeting, high quality speaker system and a gorgeous outdoor balcony that my guests enjoyed majority of their evening taking pictures outside on a sunny day. I can t thank the Manager Antony enough for his exceptional customer service. He is solely the reason why I booked both of my events at Fraserview Hall. I had other deposits at another competing hall but Antony ensured me that I was in good hands and now that my events are over I can 1000% say that Fraserview Hall exceeded my expectations. My family and friends are now booking Fraserview Hall for their events after attending mine. It was the most glamorous Haldi and Wedding Reception I ve ever experienced and booking Fraserview Hall was the best decision! The in house DJ was wonderful and played beautiful songs that my guests and myself could dance all night to. I highly recommend booking the in house DJ, they are very organized and prepare all your songs to make sure everything runs smoothly. The food was absolutely delicious, my guests had second helpings and several people told me their favourite items were the vegetable chow mein, fish pakora, chicken tikka, goat curry and bbq tandoori chicken. I also really enjoyed working with the Decor team. They truly worked their magic and made every detail look absolutely perfect. My Haldi night looked like a Bollywood movie set with all the beautiful bright colours, umbrella arch, glittery table runners, gold elephants and fancy decor pieces. They also created the most stunning set up for my Reception which included a hanging floral and crystal walkway, floating candles, chandeliers, white roses with an elegant backdrop for the stage. They upgraded and sourced gorgeous decor and took care of everything. I am grateful for the hard working staff, especially Harmeet and Shrungerri who executed my visions and made them better! My advice to anyone booking Fraserview Hall is to trust the staff, they know what they are doing and you will not be disappointed.",

            "review_text": "We attended a wedding reception at Fraserview banquet hall on Saturday, September 16, 2023. Overall, it was a great event, and the food was excellent. However, in particular, I would like to thank the gentleman standing outside the front door, who was responsible for security in the evening. We could not find parking so parked in the lot across the street and when he saw us approaching, he let us know that we should move our vehicle, as it would get towed.  During our conversation, we mentioned that we had a handicap parking decal, and he immediately offered us the parking spot that was reserved with pylons right next to the entrance of the hall. This is a level of courtesy that we usually do not see at these types of events. I appreciate Fraserview hiring staff members that care for their guests.",

All the other appetizers were made to its perfection,  I had chaat papdi twice. Dinner was served on time and again every thing was perfect,  I loved the saag paneer.
