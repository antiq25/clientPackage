            "review_text": "Went to Vancouver for a business trip.  Met up with some friends who lives in Vancouver and recommend trying Maenam. Cute small Thai restaurant with a very cool modern vibe. Service was excellent with the server being super attentive. We decided to go for their 13 course tasting menu. I wasn t able to post all the pics as it only allows me to add 10 pics to this post. The food was so amazing, small amounts so you can taste the flavours and also so you won t get too full. The tasting menu was interesting there was food that I otherwise would not have ordered at a standard thai restaurant.  The server explained each dish that came to the table. All in all a very unique experience, the desserts were so good! In love tasting menus. This one is a must try!!",

We had a reservation and did the tasting menu about $80 a person and we definitely left with full bellies! My aunt was visiting from out of town and she was absolutely blown away!

            "review_text": "An excellent spot for enjoying Thai cuisine, offering a delightful and reasonably priced dining experience. The quality of the food is exceptional, particularly the dumplings, vegetarian green curry, and coconut soup, which we found to be incredibly delicious. Similar to many establishments in Vancouver, this place caters to a diverse range of dietary preferences, ensuring that even vegans have at least one suitable choice. Additionally, their happy hour drinks are highly enjoyable. One aspect that stood out to us was the variety of options available on the menu. Whether you were a meat lover, a vegetarian, or a vegan, there were numerous choices to suit every palate. It was refreshing to see a restaurant that prioritized inclusivity and catered to different dietary needs without compromising on taste or quality. During our visit, we decided to explore the happy hour offerings, and we were not disappointed. The selection of drinks was impressive, with a range of creative and well-crafted cocktails, along with other beverage options. It was a fantastic opportunity to try something new and indulge in refreshing concoctions that complemented the flavors of the food perfectly.",

The restaurant itself is beautifully designed and furnished; and the presentation of their dishes match their elevated cafe-style dining room.  Yes, items found on their menu definitely are priced higher than your average Thai restaurant, however; you could definitely taste the freshness and the quality of their seasonal ingredients.  For example, their green papaya salad served over a whole grilled local sweet corn smart flavours and super tasty!  They also have a good selection of cocktails and drinks too.  The overall experience for me has been very pleasant!  Would most recommend this place for dates!",

            "review_text": "Maenam has great reviews and I hadn t gone for a while, so I used Dineout as an excuse to come back. Their dineout menu isn t the typical 3 course: appetizer, entree, dessert, it s made to share and because of that, there s more variety. There were some dishes that were standard, while others stood out to me. The Hot and Sour Soup was quite standard, good amount of seafood in it though and a great way to start your meal. I will say I expected more Salad from the Fried Squid Salad, but it was literally just Fried Squid. I didn t even think it was that good and would personally order a different salad. Highlights was definitely the Duck and Lingcod. The Duck Leg Curry was full of flavour, which balanced well with rice. I thought the Confit was a great call because the meat so fall off the bone tender, yet it wasn t a heavy or oily dish. As for the Lingcod, I think it was shallow fried to have the skin nice and crispy. I also appreciated the fact that this dish had the most veggies and the flavour was on point. It was my favourite dish. The Bua Loy was also very good - it s a dish if you like that QQ texture or just chewy mochi type balls in general. They used what tasted like a savory coconut milk, so it wasn t too sweet at all and very light. As for the Cashew Mor Kaeng, I wasn t really a fan, purely because I don t really like custard desserts, but my friends liked it. Overall, I had a great experience here. I like how it s quite a cozy intimate vibe that also offers good service. Food was generally good and I think dineout makes it worth a visit.",

It is definitely a spin on Thai food and I did not think it was necessary very traditional which was not a bad thing in my opinion. I love spice and some of the food was quite spicy (so heads up). The cocktails were 10/10! Would definitely go back and a would recommend. Loved that they also had a veggie tasting menu option (didn t try it) but not sure how it would work if not everyone in your party didn t want the veggie option.",

My one complaint is that with so many dishes coming at the same time I felt a little rushed. Food this beautiful and tasty should be savoured. But I don t want things to get cold. I asked if they could slow down the other dishes but was told  it s family style, it all comes out at once.  Perhaps it s easier for the kitchen, but I felt rushed. Next time I ll probably order a la carte and only order the next dish when I m ready to eat it! Despite that, the presentation was beautiful and overall good service and nice intimate ambience as well. The Brussels sprouts were likely my favorite and I ll come back just for them another day! It was a great way to celebrate a special occasion! My friends ordered the wine pairings and they enjoyed all three of the wines as well.",

My favorites were the massaman curry of beef (beef is amazingly tender), grilled thai sausage and crispy rice salad, and 3 flavour pork rib (rib portions are small but the vegetables that come with it were delicious). My only disappointment is when ordering pickup you need to ask for the thai jasmine rice which is listed as complimentary for the pick-up order. Other than that mistake on our part the 15% off on pickup orders is a nice bonus.",

You know when the prices of the food at restaurants are expensive because of the ingredients? Maenam also has the masterful art of cooking in each dish reflected in its price. We ordered the chicken satay, pork sausage salad, papaya salad to start. The chicken was tender and juicy. The pork sausage salad was a real highlight; it had crunchy rice and really flavourful sausage pieces. As with all their dishes, each flavour stands out equally so we were able to taste each wave of flavour in each dish. For the mains, we ordered the pad Thai, beef tenderloin and lamb shank. The pad Thai ranks up with the best in Vancouver. The kale chips with the meat dishes were a surprise! We were not a fan of kale beforehand but the crisp was a great way to add textures. The desserts were the coconut ice cream with caramel and the taro and pandan dumplings. These desserts were a great way to finish the meal, to neutralize the spice and end in a different flavour tone. All in all, Maenam lives up the hype and we cannot wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.",

Between two people we shared the crispy fried chicken wings, grilled thai sausage and crispy rice salad, pad thai with prawns, red curry with braised beef, and a side of jasmine rice. The fried chicken wings were super crispy and well seasoned. The tamarind dipping sauce is SO GOOD, I was eating it on its own after we finished the wings. The rice salad is served hot. It was crispy and had flavourful little rice bombs with tons of delicious pork layered throughout. The portion and sizing of this dish was very generous. The pad thai was pretty good and also generously portioned but I would expect that given the dish is $20, which is rather high for pad thai. The red curry was my favourite dish. It was super rich and decadent, and the braised beef was falling apart it was so tender.",

Every meal there is fantastic, but recently they truly set a new standard for how accommodating a restaurant can be. My friend made a bookshelf no for a special occasion. She said, in our group there is a vegan, vegetarian, person with a nut allergy (not anaphylactic) and person with celiac disease (gluten free). The host said, that s no problem. We shared the tasting menu and every dish met our combined dietary requirements, and let me tell you, it was delicious. That s a really tough combination of dietary restrictions and the staff at Maenam did not bat an eye. Thank you thank you thank you for such an incredible meal.",

Boy oh boy did Kate (The owner) and JD (The bar manager) made us feel like home and treated us like royals. First of all, the ambience is amazing. Chic and modern. We ordered the steamed local mussles for starters and green curry of halibut + stir fry of purple eggplant & crispy pork belly for entrees. Nothing was greasy, everything went so well with the rice we ordered, and the flavor was just right in all of the plates (I was especially obsessed with the crispy pork). I cannot say enough good things about this place and am so happy we found this gem. We are planning on returning next week. This made us realize the type of business we want to support especially during COVID, and Kate runs an ethical business that prioritizes customers. New favorite place for sure and I would encourage you to give it a try.",

The service was spectacular, the cocktails blew us away, and of course, the food: unbelievable! We ate at the bar and had terrific company the whole meal, with our bartender. I recommend the tasting menu. 5-6 courses of surprise after surprise. I cannot wait to go back. Back to the unique and mind bending cocktails: we enjoyed a few of the house signature drinks. I cannot recommend them more highly! Eat here!",

There are some reviews that complain about the service, but I very strongly disagree. We had amazing service from a very kind staff. Great for a date spot or otherwise. Vegetarian options: They are very accommodating to veg diets. Dietary restrictions: They checked with us on dietary restrictions and accommodated.",

We ordered the corn/papaya salad, the sausage appy and the albacore tuna curry. We also picked the Thai ginger cocktail and a good wild fermented and canned beer, both of which went really well with our meals. Our waitress was incredibly hospitable. She even brought us a free dessert which was like nothing we ve ever had before and totally hit the spot with a mix of coconut cream, fruit, water chestnuts, and young coconut. I m from Portland Oregon where we have a plethora of good food but nothing like this. These flavors were all enticing and so satisfying. So much going on in our mouths and so much originality. I m so grateful we ate here and hope you do too!",

Only complaint would be the pacing of the meal - the 3 different entrees could barely fit on the table and it was hard to enjoy them all at the same time.

I had the chefs selection and I couldnt have been happier. So much food and such a large variety of tastes, it would be nearly impossible to not like most, if not all of the dishes. Also, the staff is great. Some very friendly individuals. Ive met the owner as well, and what a lovely lady I must say! You can tell the restaurant is run as if its a big family. Overall, I cant recommend this restaurant enough. If your looking for great authentic Thai food or just an amazing restaurant in general, look no further! I promise you wont be disappointed.",

Everything was really delicious. So far, one of the best meals Ive had in Vancouver. What really blew my mind is we were the only table seated in the restaurant. I dont know why it wasnt packed.
