            "review_text": "Love dinning here with my friends! The food is always delicious and artistic! Love how they support local farmers and have unique high quality ingredients. When I was poor college student, I usually got the okonomiyaki or one of the stone bowls, one caterpillar roll, and 1 dessert and that was enough to satisfy me and my friend. I usually got something that was high in carbs that way it fills me up. That way it doesnt go over my budget. Now, I get anything from their special menu, its always different depending on the seasons. I am never disappointed what I am about to taste. The service is good and friendly! The atmosphere there is calming, chill, classy. The music in that restaurant is very relaxing in my opinion. Also, the tables are always clean and same with the dishes and cutlery. Tip: This place is quite popular so the wait time to get a table might take long (1hr +). So I suggest you make a reservation, come at 5pm, or eat a small snack before you go but that depends on your eating schedule.",

They have their very unique in house made sauces and the flavour is so strong it melts in your mouth. I enjoyed the whole course and the theme syncing with the season .",

The real question is whether a 45min-1 hr wait is worth it ?! So if you are planning to come in a large group, you should call ahead, or indeed be the first to come in, otherwise the wait times, make it only accessible to die hards or those that know, that its worth the wait. If you can find a place nearby to grab a drink with friends after you have put your name down, then time flies. So for me, I can say, that the 45 minute wait time, even though seemed long, flew quickly and the food was worth the wait. We didnt order any alcohol, just green tea, and our bill was OK.",

My most recent visit was excellent though and I tried a very reasonable variety of food. The prices are mid to high but  I cant complain about the quality and taste. Its actually quite fairly priced for the quality of food youre getting though, Ive seen other places charge more or the same for much worse quality. If I had any slight criticism of Kishimoto is that no reservations and small restaurant make it difficult to make a visit as a group.",

The photos I took aren t even all of it, the food is beautiful and tastes even better!!! The black cod misozuke literally melts in you mouth!!! They have a seasonal menu which is always delicious. They source foods locally when they can! They are always trying to create new dishes. I can t wait for the bar seating to open back up so we can watch and chat with the chefs!! When I have friends and family visit Vancouver, this is always the first place I want to bring them!! Here one tip I have if you are new: get the smoked Oshi!!!! It melts in your mouth and leaves a Smokey flavour that lingers even minutes after you are done.",

Regular sushi staples are priced reasonable, and you can also try some of the fancier menu items as well. The quality and freshness of sashimi is of a high standard.

We got lucky and only waited about 40 mins for a table. We ordered Yam Tempura, Bluefin Negitoro roll, Salmon Oshi, Ebi Oshi, Unagi Oshi, Saba Oshi and Spicy Tuna Oshi. I honestly don t remember how the Yam Tempura and Bluefin Negitoro roll were but I m sure they were good; they were out shined by the boxed sushi. We originally only ordered the Unagi Oshi and the Salmon Oshi, but they were soo good we ordered the Ebi Oshi, Saba Oshi and Spicy Tuna Oshi. My favourite was Unagi Oshi but you can t go wrong with any of them! I will be definitely coming back.",

The restaurant doesnt look like any conventional sushi joint, but having constant line up tells another story. According to the hostess, there is an one hour average of waiting and weekend could be longer; but she assures me the wait is well worth it! Since we are looking at the chef preparing our meal, we are delighted on the amount of time and effort the chef has put in. Often times, we see the master will spot check the food and would take over to help out. As soon as our dishes are made, the chefs already move onto other orders. The little details also include their home made tamarind based soy sauce and other dipping condiments that go with certain dishes. The staff advises us which fish to start first and which dipping goes with which. We are no strangers to certain raw fish characters and happy to see the staff to spend the time to make introductions. Although constantly busy, the delicacy of the food and fast turnaround makes this subtle Japanese restaurant in the Commercial Drive area shines brighter than other fancier restaurants in Vancouver.",

We ordered several smoked oshi, special ordered some assortment of sashimi but we wanted it seared and flavoured finished with some garnish. Plus I ordered the unagi oshi. The cherry wood smoked salmon oshi was a hit, visually. As well the infused scented smoke made the taste when eating of the oshi very memorable. Sashimi was a hit as well flavour from the bluefin tuna was excellent. Unagi oshizushi was so good I had half the order myself. We finished off by ordering another round of smoked oshi. Very impressed with the presentation and overall taste profile. I highly recommend eating here. I look forward to the next time we eat here.",

Oshi & sashimi are the must, obviously. Other than that, we had the rice in the Hamachi Ishinabe (rice in a hot stone bowl) which everyone thought was really good. I would order it again. The only thing we didnt like that much was the snowcrab nigiri (I thought it was okay). If you go by yourself or 2ppl And would not mind sitting at the bar, you would get to see that pretty quickly.

Beautiful decor and atmosphere, food flavours delicately balanced and unique, service was attentive, fast, and friendly. The whole package! The ebi mayo sampler had unique flavours out of the traditional norm, the oishi sushi was flavourful, the smoked sushi brought a great smoked flavour that didnt overpower the delicate fish, the mushrooms was mouthfuls of umami, the doban mushi was a new  mouth-warming shroomy broth of an experience, and the Wagyu tataki was mouthfuls of butter complemented with shrooms and crunchy garlic bits.

Most recent time we ordered the wagyu beef sashimi, sockeye salmon and akami tuna. Too bad they already ran out of toro. We wanted to try the okra appetizer as well but they sold out as well. Excellent pandemic protocols and practices in the restaurant. They dont seat anyone at the bar (they also need the counter to prepare a lot of takeout orders, as per the wait staff), and tables were truly more than 6 feet apart. There were even hand sanitizers at EACH table - fantastic. Well done, Kishimoto. Will return and highly recommend.",

Amazingly fresh and innovative food. My favourites were the nasu dengaku (fried eggplant with sweet saikyo miso sauce), the hotate nigiri, and the black cod misozuke. The presentation of the smoked oshi had a wow factor and there was a definite smokiness that was imparted to the oshi. No advance reservations but the wait was well worth it.",

Would love to do a tasting menu here!!  We started with miso, then agedashi tofu, gyoza, 2 rolls which didnt make the photo because they were too good, then had okonomiyaki and chicken karaage.  All in all a lovely meal.  Service was lovely as well, will return.  Note:  the chicken has a lot of white pepper on it, which has a bit of an overpowering taste versus the bold flavor of the chicken.  The okonomiyaki was good, but also not traditional japanese style and no noodles.  Both are still good, just different from Tokyo.  Will return!!",

I waited approximately 30-40 minutes at 7:30. Ordered the Salmon Oshi, Unagi Oshi, Tuna Maki, and Hotate with Uni Sauce. For something as simple as a maki roll, it was the best Ive ever tasted. Amazingly fresh and filled with a generous portion of tuna. Hotate and uni were incredible, finished off with a super creamy uni sauce. Their oshi is fantastic as well; constructed well and tasted great! Their service is also great and fast. Although this restaurant is considered pricier than other restaurants, I would still visit this location more often than others. The quality and service cannot be matched. Highly recommended!",

The salmon skin in the salmon skin rolls is cherry wood smoked, delicious! Try the cauliflower karaage.  Try the salmon oshi, smoked at your table.  Kishimotos prices arent low, but their food is memorable.",

Which is great, you can go walk around commercial while you wait. We got a text within 20mins so we rushed back and the table was ready for us when we got there. Sat down, got waters right away. Everyone is very welcoming. Food came out in a reasonable time, maybe 15 minutes upon ordering? Food is very good. The karage wasnt super oily. Done well. I love Aburi and this place wasnt as good as the other ones Ive had but it was up there. The spicy tuna one is different, but still very good. My favourite was the dragon roll. Dont know why, but it was perfect. Tempted to order another one. Definitely a great place for a date or a small group of 4. Cant wait to come back to try more!",

My favourites of the night were the AHI Avocado, Sashimi Salad (I can probably have that for every meal, yes including breakfast!) and the Sashimi 5 kind.

The oshi sushi was delicious as always. It was the first time we tried the hamachili roll and its one of our new favourites. The flavour combination was just right (I love the bit of kick too). Im a huge chopped scallop fan but it disappointed this time around. There was too much sauce and it overwhelmed the delicate scallop taste. Bummer. Overall, still one of my favourite sushi restaurants! Just be prepared for a wait if youre not in line before the restaurant opens.",
