I just wonder why they don t have a club sandwich. They have a great grilled chicken burger and a mean BLT but no club sandwich. I would love to see a club sandwich on the menu!",

This place reminds me of my dad who was a trucker. They had live music with Dino, who was excellent. The sunset was hitting our table just right which gave it a memorable evening. The red truck out front was a nice photo-op.",

We were meeting my hubby at Red Truck Beer.  My brother drove me and when we rolled into the parking lot I didnt expect its where craft beer is brewed.  My hubby did the ordering as he was there first with garlic fries and wings. You need to order at the counter and pay first.  Youll get a number to take to your table which helps the server to bring your order to the correct table. I had the Fish Sandwich which had beer battered cod, lettuce, tomatoe and siriracha mayo with side salad (gotta had something healthy right?) :). It was a large sandwich and flavourful.  With the crunch from the beer battered cod and freshness from vegetables this was a great start to a weekend. My brothers ordered Smoke Brisket Sandwich and Sante Fe Eggs so I cant really comment other than they enjoyed their meal. Great times at Red Truck Beer!  I cant have alcohol but still had a great time at Red Truck Beer!",

Its a large space which means you have more of a chance of finding a space, the decor inside and out is very in keeping with the name of the brewery and the cool old school trucks help with this vibe. There is wheelchair accessible entrance and also a disabled toilet on the main floor. The menu is quite varied but I have to say if you are looking for something healthy you will definitely struggle, even their salads arent amazingly healthy with creamy dressings etc. However, if your looking for a roadside truck stop classic this is the place! The beer is great and they always have tons of variety and seasonal specials, most of the staff are friendly and all of them are knowledgeable about the beer. Go make a pit stop there!",

No blame..dude looked a bit beat up.  The other service staff. Seemed in charge,  red braids, into it attitude got us back on the road though.   Burgers wer pretty standard..fresh and tasty. Fries were salted to a perfect charm. The baja lager was served cold and was super enjoyable.  The mac and cheese is a good option from the sides menu.  Theres a certain ingredient that is unique to the dish amd makes a good pair with the beer i had.  Food came quickly after we ordered and was the proper temperature..side sauces i ordered were full and plenty for our portions.  Would take a bro friend (beer flights looked interesting) or a girl that doesnt need a whole lit of doting and likes to eat.  The bathrooms here are a total experience i didnt see the womens naturally but the mens was custums sinks and faucets and all dark stained wood..a+ and with the theme.  5 stars for the redirect with service staff and great food ..fully loaded burger for under 20 is nice... would recommend/go back to try more beer and have the mac and cheese again.  The menu was full of options...but i stuck to basic bacon cheese  burg.  Totally filling and prepared well.",

The burger with fries and a beer was $14 on the weekend brunch menu. The beer was 22oz instead of 16oz because it was Monster truck Monday. I enjoyed the red pilsner. The burger was tasty and large. The fries were hot, crispy and tasty - I salt and pepper them to my taste. This brewery is right off of the Central Greenaway bike route and has a couple of bike racks for locking up. I will definitely consider returning and recommend to others.",
