Chris the technician / plumber was so great and  knowledgeable. We felt so supported.  The bill was less than we expected which was a bonus.  Don t hesitate to call them if your own plumber can t make it or if you have an emergency as we did.  Thanks so much",

He came in our home to assess the problem and made an estimate prior to doing the work. The estimate price was fair and affordable. Chris was courteous, professional, experienced, speedy and efficient in repairing our toilet that keeps on running. In addition, a big shout out to Mr. Rooter s answering service representative Kim, who has provided such an amazing customer service. She was very pleasant, kind and patient in answering my questions and connecting me with the technician. If you need any plumbing services, I highly recommend Mr. Rooter.",

            "review_text": "After a sewer line collapse, our first call was to Mr. Rooter. They did a great job of cleaning up and then proceeded to repair the line. This was no easy task as it required a 6ft deep x 10ft long trench to be hand dug. This was completed in less than a week! A Herculean task! Kevin at Mr. Rooter then referred us to BC Preferred Restoration to do major repairs in the basement suite. The floor, dry wall and cabinets had to be replaced as they were all contaminated by sewer water. Steve in the head office guided as expertly through the insurance maze. He was responsive and professional. Ivan s work was top notch and we are very pleased with the end product. Mr. Rooter and BC Preferred Restoration took a horrible nasty incident and made it tolerable with a timely professional approach. 5Star experience.",

            "review_text": "Fantastic service! I cannot recommend Mr. Rooter enough! I called them on a Sunday evening with concerns about a strong sewage like smell coming from one of my two condo bathrooms. My boyfriend and I had recently moved into this suite and an inspector had told us that one of the toilets had loose pegs / needed the wax ring replaced/resealed. We decided not to use this bathroom until after we had fully moved/settled in to the suite and until the toilet was properly repaired.. but the sudden strong stentch took us by surprise and we knew we needed help. Thankfully Mr. Rooter is 24/7 so you can call and speak with someone ASAP. I cannot even begin to express how kind and patient the receptionist was! They had initially told me that someone would call me back within 10 minutes after I had explained my concerns, yet after waiting 3 hours with no phone call I ended up calling back 2 more times to see what was going on. I understand how annoying this can be, especially when everyone was busy that night with larger tasks, but I was still treated with kindness which was appreciated in the stressful situation. After my third call I got a text from one of the workers (I believe?) saying they could not come by tonight but they were quick to book me in ASAP to have someone come over another day! Thankfully Tuesday morning was free and we were happy to wait. I recieved a call the day before to confirm my appointment and a call the morning of to inform me that the plumber was on their way over / when to expect them by. The communication was excellent! The individual who worked with me today was a blessing! He showed up on time and had a bright personality which helped to relieve my stress. Not only did he do a fantastic job with fixing our toilet, but he took the time to explain/show me what the problem was and how he went about fixing it. There was no need to second guess his work, it spoke for itself! Everything was VERY clean, professional and he was able to help me with a couple extra things he noticed after inspecting the two bathrooms. Every step of the way he kept me informed about cost and didnt pressure me once to try and get more work done. Having the chance to have that conversation and being able to make the call on what to do was great! I was happy to get the additional work done and am beyond pleased with how much better everything is working. The difference is night and day! Thank you so much for providing an excellent service! I will be sure to give you guys a call again should anything come up and will be happy to recommend you to any friends/family looking to have some work done :) Service: Toilet repair",

Once I did that, my unit was serviced the next day and was properly repaired. A huge thanks to Steve at Mr. Rooter, who gave me great advice and the confidence I needed to call the company back!

The tech, Brent, arrived right on time, and after a careful inspection of our old hot water tank, quickly came up with replacement plan that include bringing everything up to the new required building codes. Brent then went to pick up a new tank and was back within an hour. Brent did very clean and careful work, and was completely finished by 1:30 p.m. He gave us clear instructions about what to do if there were any problems with the new tank or installation...CALL HIM and he would deal with anything on warranty ASAP! He also took the time to explain about the new generation of water tanks along with things we should do to ensure their longevity. He also gave us advice about the need to replace our old water pressure regulator at some time in the near future. All in all we were thoroughly impress with the prompt service and professionalism! We would highly recommend Mr. Rooter !",

Nothing is done without your consent and there are no hidden costs thrown in, its very clear. Their technicians are lovely and keep you up to date whilst they are working. Both times were stressful events for me, and both times I felt we were very well taken care of. They also helped pass us on to get the damage to our property handled.

He left us with a full report and before and after video coverage of the problem for us to forward to the landlords. He made the suggestion that the owners might want to replace the drain pipes at some point as the roots will grow back over time. Has was an 11 out of 10. Simply fabulous.

However, the guys who delivered the machines were not able to complete the job and left everything in disarray. I was left mid-conversation without even knowing who to call to set my machines up. I called Mr. Rooter Plumbing because I wanted to be sure that my machines would be installed properly. Jaswinder was able to come in the very next day, on a Sunday, and did a brilliant job. He ensured that my plumbing was suitable and safe for the machines, and installed them in the span of a half hour. All whilst being professional, really nice, and utterly efficient. Im very grateful I can rely on this company in the future!",

My mom was hospitalized, the motor died in my car and other things were happening and then there was water leaking in the bathroom and a bedroom.  Steve at Mr. Rooter was incredible.  He told me not to worry and that he would take care of everything...and he did!  From finding the leak to replacing the pipes all was done.  Then the aftermath, talking to the insurance company all the way to having all the water damage renovations completed.  I will forever be grateful to Steve, Mr. Rooter Plumbing and APL Restorations!  Thank you all so much and I will not hesitate to refer you to all my friends and family.",

Sandi was the technician, very professional and helpful.  $335 and change and it was done! Half of what the local independent was charging!!!

In all my years of having to call a plumber he was the most polite, clean and friendly plumber I have seen. He fixed the problem explained every step of the process with me, and even cleaned the bathroom which was a huge surprise. He did what the other plumber we called on Saturday could not do, it was a hard job to find the blockage.

First thing Sunday morning, Jaswinder arrived - in the middle of a snow storm. He was efficient, professional, organized, clean and managed to keep the problem well contained - not easy in this case.  And then he solved the very ugly problem in 2hours. We expected it to take twice as long and cost twice as much. He gave us great advice about options for the permanent fix (it was roots in the drain) but he fixed it so we dont have to think about it for a long time, if we choose (dont worry Jaswinder, we wont!) The call centre person was also great - called back several times to give us updates on her search for a technician and when he would arrive, etc. Highly recommend this company and Jaswinder in particular.  Thanks for salvaging our drains and our weekend! Service: Drain cleaning",
