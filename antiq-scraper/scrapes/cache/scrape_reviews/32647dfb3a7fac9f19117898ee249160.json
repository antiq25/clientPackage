This brewery should be rated higher,  in my opinion.  We had two flights after trying to pick from the 40 beers (all but cider brewed by them). The flights were great. The spot had plenty of seating and some skinny chicken wings, but dont let that discourage you. The sweet and spicy rub were bomb. Ended up, walking away with a mix pack and the yummy torque IPA. A new must try for our Vancouver trips",

            "review_text": "Although parallel 49th isnt in the most glamorous location for food, the place itself is pretty wonderful if you need a place for a large group and good beer. You should know that you must first order your food and drink before sitting down. Food is best ordered to share, even though the portion sizes arent the biggest, they arent the smallest either, nor are they the best presented dishes. For a brewery, this place has a decent kitchen, mostly fried offerings.  Where they really excel, is the choice and quality of beer! They definitely have something for every beer lover in terms of flavors. I typically like to sit on their outdoor patio, but the inside of the building is also a great spot to hang out. Overall, if you have a large group of people and want to catch up, this place will seat you almost immediately and will feed everyone, within a reasonable budget.",

The washrooms have cool bright graffiti painted on the walls. Theyre baby friendly and have high chairs that are tall like a high chair for a bar. The drinks are great and the food was just as good.

Tucked away deep in the old industrial area, Parallel 49 is an oasis with a spacious beer garden that might even make a German miss home a little less. Trust that you will find an innovative beer menu in addition to the common staples that arguably are starting to show their age. Despite its name, the Filthy dirty is a well-balanced North West style IPA that is a solid choice for hop heads. However, should the seasonal Cobra Clutch still be on tap, why would you order anything else? It is a masterpiece and on its own merits the trek. Oh, and the food is pretty decent, too.",

Both were really yummy! Beer selection was good but the root beer was so delicious!! We stopped here at the beginning of a brewery tour. We also had lunch to start our day. Great beers! Huge selection and so many great options. My fave was the Scot....caramel flavours and very smooth. For lunch we tried the wings and tacos. Everything was outstanding. Loved the salt and vinegar wings. They were so different and yummy. The poutine was also delicious. Great fries. Lots of seating. Open and comfortable area to enjoy drinks. Very nice staff.",

Yay: - I liked the amount of seating, as well as stools that are not too high for kids or shorties like me & had back rests (it s the little things). - Loved the splashes of colour! - Food truck kitchen was so awesome & exciting for my kids. - The food was delicious! We loved the herby, garlicky pretzel, poutine, and tater tots. Was nice to see kid-friendly options. - So many options of drinks! - Lots of free street parking - Cider enthusiast option: Blueberry Jelly Monster was the closest thing. Yum! Boo: - Zero cider options!!! BAH - Muddlers: served in a mason jar with ice!!! Ahhhh. I can t drink it fast enough for the drink not to get all watered down. You gotta chug it so it doesn t get gross. I couldn t even finish it. Blagh. Tip: Maybe frost the glass instead, lose the ice. Maybe add a lemon slice or something? - Servers weren t so friendly  or are they not allowed to speak to patrons/have friendly conversation?? If so, disregard this last comment! >_< All-in-all, I would maybe go back if they had even one yummy cider option. The food is definitely yummy. Update 2/4: They had a cider option & it was delicious!! What a difference to drink cider out of the tap. And I don t have to drive all the way to Burnaby for yummy cider in great vibes. So happy I went back!!",

I cant say much about all the beers, but the ones I have tried I can say that they are unique and some that are really good. The food we ordered was the Fish tacos and the fries (I cannot remember the name, also its off the menu now). The tacos must be one of the best fish tacos I have ever had, and the fries were so good that they went well with all the beers. I love IPAs so I had a double IPA and their annual Filthy Dirty IPA. Both great beers! The second time we came here I had all Barley wines. I was so tipsy after my flight. You can see my picture on how thick the beers were. The one that surprised me the most was the whiskey barrel aged barley wine. Now if youre a whiskey lover and a beer lover, I say this is the beer for you! It absolutely blew my mind how much it had the flavours of whiskey. Great place to come and have great food and great beers! But it gets busy so get there early!",

At $18 bucks each, these arent cheap, as that doesnt even include a few fries or other side. But quality doesnt come cheap, and my grilled chicken sandwich was among the best Ive ever had. The chicken breast was big enough to overflow the bun, and it was grilled to juicy and flavourful perfection. The generous slab of brie, fresh arugula, and tangy tarragon aoili made for a meal considerably better than Id expected. Ill absolutely be back.",

The Midnight Train beer - Rum aged is to die for. Cheers! or Prosit! as they say. Update: Nov 2021- patio and beer garden gone for the season. Unfortunately so is all the dark delicious beer, like porters and stouts. Dozens of beers on tap and yet absolutely nothing on but light, American-style IPA and fruity beers. Seems the fate of so many Vancouver brewers to go the lazy route and resort to cheap and easy to produce kid -friendly (young inexperienced drinkers) beers. Here s hoping for the return of deep delicious beers soon. Check before you go or you may be disappointed.",

The twicks and paradise better become Parallel alumni because they are incredible!! I always wanted to check out the small batches that dont make their way outside of BC and Im so glad I had the chance to check out my favorite brewery in person when I did. Fingers crossed on those two beers becoming regular shipping-ready brews because they are absolutely fantastic, and frankly, P49 dont seem to export too many darker brews/stouts, so it would be awesome to see those two as their showcase set. I cannot say enough good things about those two, if theyre in rotation you must try them! Regretfully, the casino royale ran out before I could try it.",

They should consider opening another shop in West Vancouver but its up to them! I tried their famous Caffe Americano with Tiramisu Bismarck and honestly I couldnt find a better way to begin my day! The barista lady was very friendly and easy to talk. I also love their store setup from wooden antique looking shelves and displays to awesome furniture and decor and of course a working AC in these hot summer days!",

In addition to their own brews, they serve about 40 taps of local brews and a decent selection of food. The place is popular with the locals who bike or walk here, giving the place a friendly, laid back vibe. Years later, post-coviid, food is even better and beer is still great.",

Only 3 of them were out of stock due to an event that happened the day before. My dad had a pretzel and told me it was excellent with their mustard pairing. We had great service, very friendly personable staff. Phenomenal guest Taps. Their own brews were really good. I particularly liked Old Boy brown ale and Ugly Sweater Milk stout. I definitely recommend stopping by since their beer roster is always changing. Something for everyone.",
