Ever since Stephanie took over as salon manager, the salon has become SO MUCH BETTER. My dog is reactive and Stephanie is the ONLY one she lets groom her - which she always does an amazing job! Its obvious that PetSmart as a corporation cares more about money and their customers than it does its employees, but I can tell that the salons priority is taking care of the pets and making them feel comfortable. I cant imagine having to deal with reactive dogs and rude customers everyday, but they do an amazing job.",

The groomers are amazing I will never understand how they remember so many dogs their names etc. A little overpriced on some things but you can catch a great deal here and there. The training is definitely worth it for puppy socialization and the coupons they give as part of it. (Close to pays for half the training) its just a store in the end but youll never find a group of people so happy to welcome your pet to the store and I think thats why we keep going back.",

Carolyn at the PetSmart Marine Drive was really helpful when we realized the screw up and let me get the item from her store, called the other location, canceled that one item order for me and arranged for them to refund me that item. Carolyn gets these 5 stars just for her very helpful, polite and amazing customer service.",
