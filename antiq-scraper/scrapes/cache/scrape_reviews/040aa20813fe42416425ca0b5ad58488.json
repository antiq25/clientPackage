            "review_text": "Great little brewery with 8 different beers on tap.  The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was fun and inviting.  They have a food truck onsite serving a mix of burgers and snacks. Their hazy ipa has some nice fruity flavors and goes down easily.  Their normal ipa is a little darker with a nice malty flavor.  I would have liked a little hoppier profile but overall it is a solid contender. The chicken sandwich (burger) is great although everyone on my group was not a fan of the fries.  They were pretty greasy and had an odd spice on them but other than that the food was pretty solid pub style grub. We stayed for a few hours and there was a consistent flow of people coming in.  It never really got too busy and the lineup for beer was always short and moved quickly.  There were lots of locals coming in for growler fills and grabbing some cans to go as well as popping in for one or two quick drinks. This is also a nice family friendly place and their were quite a few people with their kids throughout the day.  Along with kid friendly, they are pet friendly and there were a few different pooches laying under the tables. The outdoor seating area was spread out nicely and had enough room to not feel cramped whilst ill having a close friendly feel.  The patio has an east exposure so make sure to get there early if you want to catch some rays on the deck.",
