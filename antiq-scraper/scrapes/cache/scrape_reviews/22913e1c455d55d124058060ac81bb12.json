Because they handled him so carefully he was a really sweet hamster and didnt bite us at all. In fact he would actually kiss us and lick our faces!  With the skinny pigs the employees recommend we buy two, so we did. They said good bye to them and put them in a large bin instead of a tiny box because they didnt want the skinny pigs to accidentally scratch each other. One is sassy and thick, and the other one is a cute gentle sweetie",

Holy Moses!! There were so many choices, it felt like choosing a new toothpaste/deodorant brand. I picked up a large dog bed and a topper for my sassy house cat and he actually loves it!  Hes a big stretcher, so a normal cat bed just didnt cut it.
