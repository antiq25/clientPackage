During the Covid,  lot of Doctors won t see their patients in person anymore.  Like me, I see my family doctor by phone.  The doctor would fax the prescription to the pharmacy.  However the fax machine is down.  The on duty pharmacist refuse accept the e-mail prescription as an alternative option.  What is the difference between the fax and email?  Why the on duty pharmacist only accept the fax one.  I think this is stupid.  Hope the pharmacy can be more flexible (or at least has an alternative option for the prescription), especially now-a-day most younger people don t even know what Is a fax.  Just want the pharmacy have a better services.  I will give you a better review next time.",
