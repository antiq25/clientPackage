            "review_text": "Today I went and got another new kitten from Nikki. I went to her lovely home and met her cat crew. This is my second kitten from her in the last year. Just before Xmas last year my daughter and I got a little ginger girl and we love her so much we wanted to give her a friend.  Of course we went back to Nikki and she didn t let us down. Nikki briefly spoke of how some of these cats as well as dogs,  had been treated prior to her stepping in and rescuing them and about how the pandemic and natural disasters have increased the poor faith of these vulnerable animals.  She really cares for animals.  She is defiantly a cat lady through and through. The work she does for these animals is incredible. I don t know what will happen to all the animals in the b.c in distress when she retires. Although I can t see her retiring bc she cares too much about animals being treated badly. Weather it be an issue of hoarding, owners on substances and or natural disasters. As well as her program for seniors she is right on it. We often get caught up in our busy lives and  forget about animals and there well being.  If you can t adopt a cat from Nikki please consider sponsoring a cat or make a donation. I m not sure if she excepts blankets and towels but that could be an idea as well.",

            "review_text": "This program of seniors for seniors is a big scam and financial and emotional  abuse of seniors.  I believed the video which promised to care for the health of the senior cat and all the senior had to do was love the cat.  From the first day Nikki s reluctance to care became evident.  The cat I was looking after was in poor health from the beginning.  Any time I called to get approval to go to the vet, Nikki would shriek at me saying he is  Just an old cat.  I m going to have him euthanized.    The first time she said that, I left the cat at the vets certain he would be killed.  Five days later, the vet called me to pick him up.  I was in SHOCK. Every occasion I had to deal with her was traumatizing and unpleasant!!  A horrible experience.  Abusive. Uses pre-approval to get out of paying.  Stay away from this one. I spent over $3,000 in medical care on my own and she owes me $1500 from pre-approved vet visits which she refuses to pay.  All from the scam that the visits weren t pre-approved.  And how can anyone prove that one way or another? This is cruelty .",
