            "review_text": "I was new to coaching when I began working with Laura and have found the journey to be extremely gratifying in ways I could not have anticipated. Throughout the work we have done, Laura has displayed the utmost professionalism and genuine desire to help me realize my potential. I thought coaching would be about spreadsheets and processes, but rather, the work has been centered on equipping me with a better understanding of myself, which is of far more value and use than any spreadsheet. In deciphering the mental shifts and habits that will bring me closer to my goals, Im creating changes that will serve me for a lifetime. Laura holds the space for these positive changes to come about. I highly recommend her.",
