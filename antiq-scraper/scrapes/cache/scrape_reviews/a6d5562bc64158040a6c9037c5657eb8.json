Amazing tacos (chicken, pork, veggie) and chips and salsa to go with the delicious flight of beer and fresh corn tacos.  Locally sourced meat from two rivers, just down the street. Chips for salsa from Coquitlam! And Salsa from Jumpin  Johnneys on the North Shore. The tacos are good. The service and friendliness from the staff here is superb, with great knowledge in beer. Patio out front, with easy parking. Just drive down Mountain Highway, with this convenient location. Three different pepperoni sticks available. Impressive package, top notch everything.",

They have a small patio with flower boxes that have variety of hops they use growing out of them. You can pick and smell them.

The All Out Stout is a phenomenal beer, I m glad it is back. The NSP and Bourbon Blood Orange are exceptional. It s worth going back regularly to taste new creations and rediscover old favourites...I ve discovered so many different kinds of beers like Gose and Saison (looking forward to the return of lemon gin). The specialty beers around Christmas are so good, too- I look forward to the Grinch and Santa s Sac. The people are super friendly and always greet you with a smile.
