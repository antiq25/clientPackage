            "review_text": "By far one of my favourite place to go in Vancouver! Every time we go to Vancouver we make sure we stop by the Rodney oyster s house in Yaletown. From fresh oysters to one of the best service I ve had in a restaurant, this is definitely a place you need to try. Every single plate was perfect and came super fast, we got the crab cakes, garlic shrimps, shrimp cocktail, clams, mussels and obviously oysters. Everything was so fresh and the oysters come with a lot of different choices of sauces for you to choose from. Very clean restaurant and very cute ambiance for a date, a dinner with friends or even to just go by yourself ! The staff working there has one of the best service I ve seen in years, they are really on point and so friendly and nice, this is one of the reasons we always go back there, we just love the ambiance and service so much, a lot of place should take exemple of this place ! We ve been served by Mackenzie and sadly I don t forget the name of the other employees that took care of us but it isn t the last time they will see us in the establishment! IF YOU LOVE SEAFOOD AND GOOD VIBES YOU NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE !",

            "review_text": "Im very impressed with the quality of Rodneys Oyster House. Great food and service, a fun place to be in, top class all around. We found that it is important to reserve a table, even in the middle of the week (it was summer, too, so that might add a bit). The waiter was great, the hot sauce defection was wonderful, and the choices in oyster types was unexpected and fantastic to have. We dove right in, so if you see the picture I took you can tell that a lot of the oysters had already been eaten by the time I got my camera out. You know, you go away from raw oysters for a while and you start thinking, Im kind of ok without them, or Did I really eat those things? But then you get taken to Rodneys and you relearn that oysters are amazing things to eat.",

Mussels were great, especially with the bread to soak up the sauce. Lobster is divine with a great sauce that went well with all the accompanying sides, and clarified butter - only acceptable dipping sauce for lobster. No mayo or anything that outshines this tasty crustacean!",

But just not the service was great. The food was on par too. We had -Lobster Poutine which I definitely recommend everyone try as it s super rich in flavour and the serving size was more then enough for 2 people. -12 oysters(6 from the west coast, 6 from PEI)these were definitely fresh and two different flavours. The one being from the west coast looking more of a deep shell and darker meat. Being sweet and more flavourful. Compared to the ones from PEI being a more shallow shell and lighter meat. Concluding to a more salty flavour. Ended up grabbing 2 more of the west coast because being so fresh and delicious. -New England Clam Chowder was another good choice if you want a classic clam chowder. Will come back again in the future or recommend anyone that comes to Vancouver for a visit",

But my favorite is the Lobster rolls and the Halibut. The lobster rolls are not kn the menu so you should ask the waiters for it. The staff are super friendly and very professional. They brought the food in an order that we had food all the time and they didnt bring all the food at the same time. The environment is also clean and cozy and the kitchen is clean.",

Oysters were amazing, I LOVED 1 of the sauces (the dark purple vinaigrette one). The butter that was for the bread was the best butter Ive tasted (homemade old fashioned vibes, favorite kind) loved it. Service of getting my 1st (and only) drink took a very long time (asked for easy spice .. and it came spicy af w/alot of horseradish) .. I couldnt finish my drink, I think I drank a few inches. Oh well ... they were busy.",

To start with the services were fantastic and staff was super friendly. I was recommended a few dishes as a first timer at this place. I tried Oysters, Garlic Prawns and Atlantic Lobster Poutine. Starting with Oysters, as they were just amazing. Then we got Garlic Prawns, which were served with a bit of garlic soup and bread on the side. This was my first ever time trying the dish and I just couldnt stop myself once I tasted it. It was fabulous. Lastly the lobster poutine which was equally delicious and filling. I will definitely recommend Rodneys to all my friends and family. Cheers!! Parking: Usually available in front of the restaurant. Wheelchair accessibility: There are 2 floors but only floor 1 is accessible to wheelchair",

Best chowder in the city. Currently serving, the New England and Manhattan versions. Two of my favourites are on covid-19 holiday, the Corn Chowder and my personal favourite The Slap Jack (leek and fresh poached oysters)! I look forward to their return. Happy Hour is called Low Tide and is the best spot in town for happy hour food and drinks. Wine is poured into a 5.5 oz glass filled to the top so be prepared to sip, in place, from the table. Lastly, a shout out, the music play list is awesome! You cant go wrong at Rodneys Oyster House in Yaletown. There is a location in Gastown that is awesome but the atmosphere in Yaletown is magical!",

The interior is so cosy and the festive ambiance is very cute. The service was very polite, efficient and courteous. The food   was delicious. I really enjoyed the meals we got and I totally recommend the Oyster Po boy and obviously the oysters. Great selections of sauce to accompany the oysters ~ Overall lovely time, great food and service. Now you just need to enjoy it yourself by going as well :-) Cheers~",
