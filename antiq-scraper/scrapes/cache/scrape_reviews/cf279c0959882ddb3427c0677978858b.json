            "review_text": "Love Five Guys as they always have the best fries in town. absolutely crunchy outside and soft inside, just the right amount. You can customize your burger, and they never mess it up, plus the great fries. They are just a fav go-to place for a quick burger and fries. The fact that they give you free peanuts in shell and have their potato bags all around the store with the peanut oil which they fry it in just creates an awesome environment. Love the open kitchen and the fact that you can see the fries are cut right there, with skin in different shapes. Just so much better than many fast food chains. I just wish they were open longer hours and had more locations.",

The service and speed are average, and the atmosphere is dirty and rushed, but thats what you would expect here, its a part of the experience to have a table and floor covered in peanuts, and they delivered on that.

Fries were a bit salty, but it perfectly balanced the fatty taste from the burger. I always order my burger with some bacon in it, never regretted. They use peanut oil, so be careful with your allergies. They do bottomless refills on pop and unlimited supply of toasted peanuts. Peanuts, you would think. But it was ridiculous how many peanuts I had. At first, it doesnt feel anything special, then 10 minutes later, you are left with piles of peanut shells. I know its American chain, but you gotta enjoy this.",

I was getting mine to go, so didnt try them on this visit but the past visit they were good.  I love their fries as well! This visit I was only getting a cheeseburger to go because it was close to dinner time.  I took my cheeseburger to go and upon arriving home about 20 minutes or so later the burger was still toasty.  :)  You can add your own customized toppings but I just the basic and love their burgers.  Just the way I like them.  I also realized I got the regular burger instead of the mini so it has 2 patties.  I had to skip dinner. :)   I appreciate this business as they are always so busy when I go and they are just hopping and hustling and everyone gets fed.  Thank you!",

Cons:  We visited as a BC Lions game ended, and the restaurant was extremely busy (giving the staff a little bit of a pass) they were running around with orders and unable to keep the restaurant clean.  The floors had food and garbage, and the bathrooms were filthy.  The bathrooms were a major one for me because the mess appeared to have been there all day. Wheelchair accessibility: You can get into the restaurant, order, and sit in a few of the tables that are closest to the door.  You cant easily get a wheelchair to the back to pick up your food, get condiments and drinks, or access the bathrooms due to the tables being in the way and the amount of skip the dishes drivers and other customers standing around waiting for their orders.  It is pure chaos in that area, but another customer offered help.",

The burger was flavourful and just one bite is enough to let you know that they used quality ingredients in it. Only (minor) complaint is that the ingredients fell out quite easily so it was messy eating it. Toilet available on the premise. As others have mentioned, peanuts are available for you to help yourself too while waiting for your order.",

Freshly cut and fried in front of you they are so good the spicy ones are my favorite. The Pattys are made freshly. The whole kitchen is visible nothing is happening that you cant see. Customer service is also good places world Cup clean. If you are in downtown I highly recommend you guys try this. Their veggie sandwich all the way is my favorite",
