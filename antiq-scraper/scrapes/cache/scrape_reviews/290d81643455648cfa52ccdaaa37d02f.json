We ordered veggie spring rolls too, those were average, nothing special. On Uber Eats I specified a nut allergy for my partner and they tried to call to say sate beef has peanut sauce in the marinade, but I couldnt pick up as I was in a meeting. Im glad they left a note on the sandwich. It was ok because I ate that one instead of us sharing the two types. I would recommend adding notes about which items have nuts on the descriptions, as the Uber Eats description didnt indicate peanut sauce. Maybe its supposed to be assumed with sate sauce, but its better to be safe and clear. We would definitely order again! Edit: I left a review on Uber Eats before posting the Google review. No worries.",

            "review_text": "Due to the high reviews on Google, I did have expectations trying them out for the first time. I went early for lunch (11am) to beat the lunch rush, and got the deluxe classic. I found the cilantro and jalapeno to be stale. Like it was left overnight in the fridge and dried out. I cant quite pinpoint the bread, its not out of the oven in the morning fresh, but not stale either. Lastly, the sandwich was built lopsided, so one side had a lot of radish and carrot and the other side had none. A bit more pate and butter would have made the overall sandwich less dry. Having said all of that, I will go back to try the lemongrass chicken, something a bit more wet to begin with. The location is far too close to my work and I can literally eat banh mi everyday.",

Their breads are delicious, and the banhmis are well seasoned without being oily, salty and the toppings generally taste fresh. The service is quick, restaurant looks clean, and I like their minimal plastic packaging. After a brief hiatus and on this last visit, they have begun nickel and diming for their sandwiches. I ordered extra meat (as I always do), and feel like I barely got any extra. For 2$ (which is like a quarter the cost of a sandwich, I would expect a rather full sandwich. I also paid for extra dikon and radishes (which was 50cents but used to be free), and the sandwich was just... Normal. It wasnt any larger. For all of this nickel and diming, Im sure not seeing any results for it. I am paying more and getting objectively less. The tofu salad roll that I always liked, was now smaller, the tofu was much saltier than before, and worse yet, the peanut sauce they gave felt like it was water with peanut butter bits mixed into it. I didnt even bother using it. Im not sure whether I will return, probably one more time to give it one more shot. But this place certainly wont be one of my reliable go-to, healthy, and affordable restaurants anymore.",
