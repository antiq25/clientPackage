We had a halibut special with risotto that was seasoned perfectly, and fish and chips that had a perfectly crisp batter and the octopus app was excellent. We had our young children with us and the staff was happy to accommodate. They dont have a kids menu, but made a small pasta dish with cheese sauce for the kids.",

Fresh and delicious! Server was really hard to flag down though which was slightly disappointing. Would recommend paying a little more attention to the customers that are seated in the patio section as they tend to be forgotten about :)",

Service is fast and very friendly, the menu if interesting and varied. Happy Hour oysters are 1.50 each, so we had a dozen. Fresh and delicious. My wife had the special, pan fried Halibut in a roasted red pepper sauce which was delicious, perfectly prepared. I had the Paella with prawns, mussels and clams, it was delicious. Atmosphere is cozy and warm, altogether a delightful experience. Would highly recommended.",

There is no other place that has a personal touch of the overall experience, starting from the on-the-house warm bread with a side of chickpea puree and even to the chocolate truffles,a complimentary treat at the end. Now to the real deal, you can literally taste the flavors of the ocean in your mouth. You can savour its freshness and a whole level of gastronomical expertise tossed in a plate. The Sockeye Salmon Wellington, the Fishworks Paella and the Scallop Risotto are my top 3 food in their menu! A must to recommend to my friends and family.",

However, tonight we had one of THE best waitresses we have ever had (and we eat out fairly regularly). Maia served us on the patio and was thoroughly attentive, thoughtful, ultra pleasant, and genuinely gave us a can-do, my pleasure attitude. Such a rarity in todays service industry. A request to the owners of Fishworks, please do what you can to keep Maia on staff. We will most definitely be asking to be seated at her table for our future visits. Thank you Maia for a memorable evening!",

Lobster Mac n cheese- excellent and so much flavor... last but not least the Cod n chips, perfect! The portions are generous, the presentation is lovely,  and the price is right for the quality you get. The restaurant is beautiful and the patio seating was quaint and had a romantic feel to it... definitely a place to check out when visiting North Vancouver.",

They must magick their seafood down from some wonderful place on high where the fish are personally blessed by a great deity. Seriously, it was that good. The service was outstanding as well. When we went pre-pandemic, we didnt have reservations because we were just dropping in to check it out, and the service at the bar was superlative. This time, we reserved a table and it was again excellent. They were even nice enough to help me with a mask when Id lost mine after taking it off for dinner. Well be making the trip up again in a couple months to eat here, and Id imagine that as long as we live in the region, well make sure to come by at least two or three times a year if not more.",

The seafood is fresh, and Ill recommend the starter platter (the King crab is the only thing I think may be previously frozen). The paella is packed with seafood. The salmon Wellington is their signature, but I find it is on the dry side and really needs the pesto sauce to help it out. No fuss good food restaurant to enjoy with your friends and family.",

We started with Crispy Squid and Prawns - sooooo good. My hubby had the same as last time - Wild Pacific Halibut Poutine with goat cheese gravy... as good as he remembered. I had the Hokkaido Scallops with home made squash tortellini,  sage burn butter sauce, toasted walnuts. The scallops were cooked to perfection and everything else on the plate was wonderful too. If I could have licked the plate clean, I would have. Also the wine recommendation was spot on. We had a California white called Lieu Dit from the Santa Maria Valley. We highly recommend this restaurant... the staff are professional and friendly. If you are staying in downtown Vancouver hop on the seabuss (route 1 to get there and route 2 to return) and walk to this neighbour gem in North Vancouver. It is soooo good! Thanks Fish Works for a memorable meal.",

My friends, wife and I were lucky to get a seat at the bar as walk-ins after being turned away from 2 other restaurants.  Service was friendly.  The frontman behind the bar was a true gentleman.  Their wine selection is pretty good but I opted for a beer since we walked in at the end of happy hour. Shucked oysters at happy hour seem like good value for money, so we got some and were served by the frontman. Great way to start the evening. My wife got the lobster bisque. As others have reported, it is really friggin good.  Their salmon wellington is quite simply the best piece of seafood Ive ever had in North Van. Awesome experience.",

Finished off with Creme Brulee to share.  The salmon and creme brulee were the stars of the show. Hope to return soon. Parking: Tough to find parking in LoLo.

For the first time I sat at the bar; what a wonderful experience! To note that Tom is just the man behind the bar or the barman totally misses the point. Tom is the maestro food & entertainment director, he greets as many as he can, brings you into his dining area while ensuring that the entire restaurant is running like the well oiled machine that it is. So whether its a quiet tete-a-tete, a boisterous gathering or simply oysters and a beer you must visit Fishworks and say hi to Tom to be entertained, fulfilled and satisfied.",

That said, there was no warm-bread and we were seated right by the door. Table favourites were octopus, scallops, and the poached-pear dessert. Steamed whole fish and other fish dinner was also well-prepared, tasty, and worth a try. Reasonable pricing, good food, highlighted by superior service earned Fishworks this 5-star review. Parking: No parking in front, but side streets and lot parking available Wheelchair accessibility: Able to accommodate, call ahead to confirm!",
