One of our group vowed that she didn't like Salmon but she sure enjoyed this Salmon Burger and is now a 'convert'.  The $15 cost was well worth it for a freshly grilled generous Salmon portion~ hope we get to enjoy the same next year!  A small favour ~ It would be nice to have the option of different types of Buns, besides a White Bun ~ thank you!",
