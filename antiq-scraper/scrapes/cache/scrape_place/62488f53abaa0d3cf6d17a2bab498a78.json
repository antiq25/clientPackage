The floor, dry wall and cabinets had to be replaced as they were all contaminated by sewer water. Steve in the head office guided as expertly through the insurance maze. He was responsive and professional. Ivan's work was top notch and we are very pleased with the end product.\n\nMr. Rooter and BC Preferred Restoration took a horrible nasty incident and made it tolerable with a timely professional approach. 5Star experience.",

He is very experienced and knew what was the issue and how to go about contacting insurance etc.  All this was done in a day and Kevin contacted the insurance with a quote and immediately approved and the next day people came to start the repairs.  Kevin arranged everything and the job was done quickly and done well.  I will recommend Mr. Rooter for sure.",
