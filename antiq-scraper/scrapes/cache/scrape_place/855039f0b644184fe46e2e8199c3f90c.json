They never show up to fix it when they say there going too and the people they do send don't look or act professional in and way. and reading all the past reviews in not sure how this company is still in business.

Then another week.  Then Otis said they would come on Monday, and simply didn't show up for a week.  They evidently don't work on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays.\n\nhere are elderly people in the building who are missing their doctor's appointments, and who don't like being unable to go out for over a month.  I have phoned Otis Canada a few times, but have never been able to get any information.  My wife has cancelled 8 physiotherapy appointments. (so far!)  Now the long weekend is coming up (Labour Day), people would like to move out.\n\nOne person wanted to move out 2 weeks ago.  He can't, because there's no elevator.  I find it extremely odd that Otis will not work for double or triple overtime or whatever.  I have sent the main office (not the Vancouver office) 3 emails, which they cannot be bothered to acknowledge, it seems; there is not even an automated reply.  I phoned the Vancouver office just now - put on hold, and then transferred to a different number, which didn't answer.  I phoned the Vancouver office again, and there was no answer.  We have had no information at all from Otis for about 2 weeks now.\n\nIt's incredible, really - there are about 60 apartments in this building, and no one knows when the elevator will be repaired, or even if it will be repaired ever.",
