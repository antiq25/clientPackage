Cherry sent us the recent sale history in the neighborhood. Communicated with the listing agents to follow up the status of any potential submissions. Guide us how to present the offers to win in this bidding game and not too much over listing price and within our comfort and affordable zone. good news came back 2 hours after the offer submission. We were more than flattered and excited. I have heard many friends who have been unsuccessful to get an accepted offer. I would say because you have to meet a true realtor who works with you, not work for you. Cherry fulfilled our dream in one shot. The reason she is able to do it is she is experienced and knowledgeable. She will only tell us the truth without cosmetic to the transactions. She is efficient and high energy to her career. Highly Recommend Cherry to all of you",
