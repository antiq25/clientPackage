As this restaurant already has a good track record via other reviews, I think this place is more mediocre compared to other HongKong style kitchens. Why, you may ask? Well, the main reason was because there was nothing special about it. The only thing that sparked my interest was the pork chop sandwich, which didn't get me wrong, tasted good, but everything else (excluding customer service) was lacking. From the food to the seating (which I mind you are half car seats half regular chairs) limited my comfort during my eating experience.\n\nThe meal I had was the problem chop sandwich, although good, lacked balance between freshness and saltiness. All you can realistically taste are the savory flavors of the marinated porkchop (and baking soda, which makes it tender) the mayo and a bit of the onions. On top of that, the sandwich came with a big bed of fries, which adds onto the savory oily pork chop. Also, the Hong Kong style milk tea tastes the same as any other H.K Cafe within Metro Vancouver.\n\nMy friends' satay noodles were plain and full of msg (like the majority), nothing really special at all. The breakfast meal is decent in terms of taste but is a bang for your buck. You get to try multiple items for a decent price. Comes with a drink also. Again, nothing surprising compared to any other H.K style Cafe.\n\nTo leave this mediocre review with a high note, the customer service was nice. The waitress noticed my fries were missing and quickly asked the chef to cook the fries fresh for me and apologized. In my opinion, it's not a big gripe, which is why I would give this place a solid 3 stars. I would recommend giving this place a try for most, but it can be a hit or miss (depending on what you order)",

Enough food for 2 people. Onion gravy good with fries.\n\nService excellent, attentive, friendly, with a personal touch.",
