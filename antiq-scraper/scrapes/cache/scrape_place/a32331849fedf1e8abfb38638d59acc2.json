I have searched for SMP specialists in various Asian countries, including Korea, but finding someone who delivers results as natural as Mr. James was exceedingly challenging.

His attention to detail, demeanour, knowledge, set up,  student preparation and, of course, patience is excellent.

His attention to detail, demeanour, knowledge, set up,  student preparation and, of course, patience is excellent. There was not a moment where I didn't feel I was getting the best SMP education available and I would recommend his course (or his work) 100%.",

This course provided a solid foundation to start a career in SMP. I usually leave asking myself if I am able to pursue, but I left feeling confident with Rob's guidance. I'm grateful for the expertise I gained, and I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to excel in the field of Scalp Micropigmentation! Thanks for a great class, Rob!",

I had been researching this for a long time but never really felt like I was ready to pull the trigger. However, I can confidently tell you that Rob is the last Instagram feed you'll scroll through, the last Google review page you'll need to pour over and the final free consultation you'll make.\n\nA gentleman and a scholar, Rob made me feel totally comfortable throughout the entire process. He's one of the oldest SMP artists in North America and his volume work speaks for itself. Oh, and something unique about Rob, he REALLY loves what he does. That passion was evident from first meeting him and it really helped solidify that I had made the right choice.\n\nThanks, Rob!",

Like many say, my only regret is that I didn't do this sooner!\n\nI was on the fence for a long time regarding SMP. Wasn't sure if it would look ok and where to start looking. Rob James came highly recommended by a colleague. His results looked very natural and I can see the confidence it gave him. I decided to reach out to Rob after looking at looking at his website, Instagram, looking at reviews and even checking out other providers.\n\nDuring our consultation Rob explained the process and expectations. Rob was not only professional, but was very easy to talk to. I wasn't rushed or pressured. It wasn't a pushy sales pitch. He was just extremely knowledgeable and a genuinely kind  person that cares about your results.\n\nThe studio is private, clean and easy. Everything about it was easy - easy to get to, easy to park, no shared space or hallways with other businesses. A private appointment means just that.\n\nI've completed 3 sessions with Rob and it looks awesome! I love that it's natural looking and I am gob smacked at times when looking in the mirror. The sessions in the studio breeze by. There's always something to talk about and we even talk about nothing. Lots of laughs for sure. You can tell Rob loves what he does and is a craftsman with his work.  I highly recommend Rob James for your SMP needs.\n\nThank you Rob! I look forward to catching up soon!",
