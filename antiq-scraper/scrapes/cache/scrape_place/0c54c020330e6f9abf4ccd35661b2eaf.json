It's hard not to suspect that they are reducing their workload in this way. The staff have always been friendly and caring perhaps this store is starting to lower their standards.

They were in there for so long, a milky surface had formed on the surface, and white mold surrounded them. Some bodies simply decomposed, the skeleton visible.\nIn the aquatic fauna section, the leaves that remained either were yellowed and melting away.
