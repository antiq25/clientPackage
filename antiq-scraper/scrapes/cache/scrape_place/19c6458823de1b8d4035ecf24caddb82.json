The Basque style cheesecake was worth it alone but honestly everything was delicious.\nThe delivery arrived on time and with a smile.

When I heard about El Mercat I was a bit of skeptical  as I thought \"well one more trying to imitate Spanish cuisine\". When I placed the first order and we tested for dinner at home, we couldn't give credit to the quality. Excellent food (croquetas, canelones and Basque cheesecake) . Then the Tuna Empanadas  appeared yummy . The quality of the food is so good , the service and the unbeatable attention Chef Sanz is awesome. Congratulations well done. Salud !!",
