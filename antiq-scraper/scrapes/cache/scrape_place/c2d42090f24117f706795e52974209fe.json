The menu isn't huge but the features menu is sizable and almost as fulsome as the regular menu.\nNo meat - all fish options and a hearty mix of raw and cooked. Primarily raw fish appetizers but also some salads and veg dishes available. (The Burrata was the most expensive I've seen on a menu).\nThe apps were great- we saw almost every table around us get the French fries- they're delish also really enjoyed the yellow beans (heavy on the tarragon). The mains were good but they don't come with sides- nice to share some sides for the table.\nService was very friendly, drinks were good- the mocktails were fine, not amazing.\nThe atmosphere was great- big patio and the seating inside is also ample.\nMany vegetarian options!",

We had two very nice attentive waiters serving us. The atmosphere is lovely and lively, and the patio is pleasant. The food was very good but lacking the wow factor I was expecting, and my friend thought the same. I think part of the reason is, the bar is now set so high by all the good places to eat in this city. We had the mussels, halibut cheeks, hand cut fries and pea tips. The best mussels I've had still remains those at Locals restaurant in Courtenay. The best halibut cheeks my friend has had still remains at the now closed West restaurant in Vancouver. It was my first time trying halibut cheeks so I was quite excited, but they were somewhat bland and to me, the texture made it seem like it could have been from any part of the fish. They were served with tartar sauce and pickles which was interesting. Very small serving size for a $50 entree; not enough for one person if you're hungry. I filled up on fries and bread instead. My friend is a huge pea tips fan and as I predicted, he prefers the traditional Chinese method of cooking them, with more subtle flavouring and more garlic. I agree that method allows the bitterness and flavour of the pea tips to shine. But the soy sauce / sesame oil variation at Oddfish was still nice. In my opinion, the best part of the meal was the hand cut fries, the aioli it was served with, and the carbonated water made on their in-house machine. Very good carbonated water. All in all, I'd go back, but I wouldn't run back.",
