I just want to share my experience that can save others a hassle and potential harassment. Being a nurse and also a business owner, I didn't think I would go through a major downfall. Life happened where I lost my house and had to move in with relatives while I went through counselling and getting back on my feet now 2.5years later. These guys sent me to collections for over $600.00 not because of gym time I used but because OF A CONTRACT. Even knowing the circumstance I was in. With that being said, started then harassment phone calls, once again because of a CONTRACT. We are in an era where please try to refrain from any signage of contracts as possible. Then this year they sent another total to collections for an account that did not exist trying to collect extra money. Thank God I still kept the email of confirmation from 2.5 years ago. When I called, I knew I also needed email proof so they don't lie. Instead of an apology of trying to extort more money and sending it to collections, the women recanted and said she didn't have proof in writing but I sent the previous email for account closure and final receipt from the years prior. These idiots have caused so much time wastage and stress. To make time to even do this review, I'm at work on my break.  I could of course not afford a lawyer than whereas I can now and would of fought this just for the purpose of humanity. I have a membership with Club 16/She's Fit, Club Pilates and a personal trainer now. They are not like this. Transparency is key and this company really will Destry you when there is a bigger picture in life. DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THEM. THEY HAVE NOT CHANGED ANYTHING. Anyhow if you go through something in life, the customer service you will received from this company is beyond disgusting. There are many companies with policies in place like ones I work for and I own where we consider cancellation of services and deposit based on individual need. I will be posting more on my blogs in the upcoming months in regards to contracts. Also when approaching them, assure you have it in email - which is what I did to assure they didn't falsely take more money.",

Then this year they sent another total to collections for an account that did not exist trying to collect extra money. Thank God I still kept the email of confirmation from 2.5 years ago. When I called, I knew I also needed email proof so they don't lie. Instead of an apology of trying to extort more money and sending it to collections, the women recanted and said she didn't have proof in writing but I sent the previous email for account closure and final receipt from the years prior. These idiots have caused so much time wastage and stress. To make time to even do this review, I'm at work on my break.  I could of course not afford a lawyer than whereas I can now and would of fought this just for the purpose of humanity. I have a membership with Club 16/She's Fit, Club Pilates and a personal trainer now. They are not like this. Transparency is key and this company really will Destry you when there is a bigger picture in life. DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THEM. THEY HAVE NOT CHANGED ANYTHING. Anyhow if you go through something in life, the customer service you will received from this company is beyond disgusting. There are many companies with policies in place like ones I work for and I own where we consider cancellation of services and deposit based on individual need. I will be posting more on my blogs in the upcoming months in regards to contracts. Also when approaching them, assure you have it in email - which is what I did to assure they didn't falsely take more money.",

The management team there has consistently displayed a lack of customer service skills, bordering on rudeness. During all my workouts, I was abruptly told not to drop the weights, a message that could have been conveyed in a much more polite and professional manner.\n\nBut what truly pushed me over the edge was the handling of my membership cancellation. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, I called to cancel my membership and was under the impression that it had been taken care of. Imagine my surprise when I just recently found out my membership was still active, and I had been billed all this time. When I called to rectify the situation, I was met with vague responses and no straightforward answers.\n\nI've since signed up with West Coast Iron, a nearby gym, and the difference in customer service and gym quality is night and day. Gold's Gym in Port Coquitlam has been by far the worst gym experience I've ever had, and I strongly urge anyone considering a membership to think twice.",
