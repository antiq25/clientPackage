He claimed extra butter is only for breakfast hours, despite the fact that it's a standard option on the kiosk, similar to the availability of complimentary ketchup.\n\nWaqas's dismissive and confrontational attitude was disrespectful. He even argued I hadn't paid separately for the butter, using this as a reason to deny it. This experience was disheartening and marred my overall visit.",
