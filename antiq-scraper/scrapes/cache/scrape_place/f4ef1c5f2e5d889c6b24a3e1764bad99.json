So I was solo and of course I was seated in the bar counter area. I could see the Michelin guide sign in front of me. The clerk was very busy moving around. You can see how popular this place is. I had a warm latte with lavender added. Next I chose two famous Liege style waffles topped with milk chocolate lavender and mixed berries compote. I guess I expected too much. The clerk was busy and didn't give much service. The expected waffles were not very warm and small size. The topping sauce was smooth and flavorful. I look forward to the next time and want to visit again.",
