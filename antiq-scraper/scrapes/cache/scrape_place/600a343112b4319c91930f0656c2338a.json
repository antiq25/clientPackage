But they have different material options, like aluminum or veneer if you don't like acrylic, they have tons of different engraving  options with or without color.\n\nThe customer service is amazing! You send them your file and they work with you to get it perfect. Also the website is very user friendly. The best part: every portfolio includes overnight shipping, once it's done in production.\n\nBelow is the \"cover\" I haven't put my prints in yet. No filters\n\n#supportsmallbusinesses",

This is 100% part of the leather.  The upside of vegetable tan leather is that it patinas over time and ages beautifully, darkening and evening out completely.  We note on our website that all of our leather will have natural blemishes as this is the very nature of leather.\n\nWe understand that mistakes happen although this is not one of them.  Please allow for the vegetable tan leather to take its course and patina, which will add beauty and character to your portfolio book and case.",

I paid the rush fee to get the week turnaround, and it came just as expected- was shipped overnight and got here early in the morning with no issues. Klo did an amazing job on my portfolio, it turned out beautifully. Very pleased with the work they did. :)",

And this comes from someone who was very nervous and anxious about ordering. But from the very beginning to the end result I wouldn't have changed a thing and will probably revisit them in the future! The team at Klo is so supportive. I probably called quite a few times asking multiple questions about the process, how it works, which book would be best, etc. and they never hesitated to answer my questions. They always made me feel so confident and secure about my book with constant emails about the process and if there were to be any changes made, which I really appreciated a lot. And it so happened my book was engraved instead of a die-cut which worked out so much better! And they made sure to run everything by me first and send my proofs. They were always very professional and friendly. Willing to help accommodate any of my needs.\n\nWords cannot describe how AMAZING my book came out. So much better then what I imagined!! So sleek and professional! Packaged perfectly and so cute and personalized with my name all over the wrapping which definitely made me feel special. When I bought it to class, so many students feel in love with it and we're blown away! They even decided to go with Klo for their books after seeing mine. Every job interview I have been on has said amazing things about my portfolio. It really leaves an impression. At my portfolio show, I'm not kidding jaws dropped.\n\nI cannot express how awesome Klo is. From the every aspect they are with you and for you. I love them so very much!!! So please i recommend them so highly to you! And if this helps, I just got a graphic design job and let's just say my book stuck their attention ;)\n\nThank you Klo for your exceptional work!",
