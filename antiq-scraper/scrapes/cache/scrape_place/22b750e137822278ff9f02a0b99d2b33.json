She disdainfully said that I should be queuing here. I was stunned and didn't know what to say. I said: You saw me in line early on, shouldn't you tell me where I should queue? Instead of treating me with such extreme rudeness and disdain. She did not answer me and continued to call the customers behind me to order. I really have nothing to say. This happened on Sep 30th at 10:30 a.m. If the manager of McDonald's sees this message, please check your schedule and see who served me, and then please give her a complete training, or even teach her how to treat others politely. Thank you.",
