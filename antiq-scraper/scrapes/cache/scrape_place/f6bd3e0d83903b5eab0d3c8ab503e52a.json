Hot tub has been out of order 35% of times I have been here to work out.  Back hall to pool is cold and showers are awful. No hooks or benches to keep your towel or clothing off the floor and dry and it's too wet, dirty and cold to want to use them without having your change of clothing with you  During busy times no staff putting away weights, can't find anything. We work out in the evenings and often there are 3+ staff behind the counter, they say hi- but seem more interested in talking about their dates and looking at a hotel others phones.\n\nI asked for a discount. I'm stuck in a contract and hoped it was the least they could do for me. It took 3 months and at least 6 calls and requests to have the mama heft contact me and was told no. I'm going to ask a lawyer to go over my contact and see if I can just end it\n\nI still have my member ship with Anytime Fitness and am glad. I won't be renewing my membership when this one's done.",

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the intermittent closures earlier this year. We acknowledge that there were maintenance challenges that affected the availability of the hot tub during the months you mentioned.\n\nFirstly, one of the pipes that was essential for the functioning of the hot tub broke down unexpectedly. We ordered the new parts right away but because of the supply chain issues it took longer than expected. Further, there were chemical imbalances and a sudden visit by Fraser health led us to closing it. We have taken measures to rectify the situation and are pleased to inform you that the hot tub has been fully operational for a considerable period now, without any reported issues. Also, we drain the water every Thursday to fill it back in and that has helped us a whole lot in preventing these unforeseen occurrences.\n\nAs for the club runs, we value your feedback and will definitely be talking to the staff to better utilize their time and are more attentive to the member needs. \n\nWhile we are unable to offer a discount on your membership, as our membership agreements and pricing structure are standardized for all members, we are committed to providing you with an improved experience moving forward. We value your loyalty and feedback, and we are dedicated to making the necessary improvements to ensure you have a positive and enjoyable time at our gym.\n\n\nWe are truly sorry to hear that you won't be renewing your membership with us, but we respect your decision and hope you continue to enjoy your membership with Anytime Fitness. If there's anything else we can do to improve your experience, please don't hesitate to let us know.",

It's disheartening to know that our handling of your situation fell short of your expectations, causing you distress and a reluctance to consider gym contracts in the future.\n\nNormally, if you are moving 30km away from the gym and provide a copy of one of the acceptable proof of move, it should have been a seamless process. Regardless, I apologize for any confusion or lack of clarity in our cancellation policies at that time. We are committed to improving our policies to ensure they're transparent and member-friendly to prevent such instances in the future.\n\nI deeply regret any negative experiences you had with our previous gym manager, Jean. Rest assured, we take your concerns seriously and will look into this matter further to enhance our management interactions and overall customer service.\n\nOn a positive note, I'm glad to hear that your personal trainer, Michelle, made a positive impact during your time at our gym. Our trainers are dedicated to helping members like you achieve their fitness goals, and it's heartening to know that Michelle played a valuable role in your fitness journey.\n\nIf there's anything more you'd like to share or if you have specific suggestions on how we can improve our services, I'm here to listen.
