I went inside and stood at the counter and waited for my order. There's no lineu, there's only one order on the order screen, which was mine. There's nobody at the till, there's a couple cooks in the back mopping and a lady up front mopping. After a few minutes the lady up front sees me and then tells the cooks that there's an order up. The cooks say something I couldn't understandand and disappear around the corner. I assume that they're going to finish baking my cookies. Fresh baked cookies, yay, I mean why else would I be waiting around this long for six cookies? They were in the oven baking. No doubt.\n\nBut they weren't. They weren't in the oven baking. After about 7 or 8 minutes another young lady comes out from, I guess the break room, and asked if I've been helped. I'm like \"yeah I placed an order a while ago.\" She looks at the till and then reaches under the counter and grabs me six cookies and hands them to me. And, oh yeah, they weren't chocolate cookies either, they ran out. They were the chocolate chip ones. So I wait around for almost 10 minutes for six cookies, and they weren't even the right ones. The complacency at this McDonald's was unreal. I have to laugh honestly it was so bad it was comical. The girl who came in at the end who actually got me the cookies I will say, was doing her job correctly as far as I can tell..\n\nI decided to get cookies here because I was picking up an Uber eats order. Except they told me I had to cancel the order because the customer ordered things from the evening menu and it was now on the breakfast menu. So I had to text the customer and let them know I can't pick up her order because they can't make it and I'll have to cancel. And I canceled. My question is why does this McDonald's have items on their Uber menu that customers can't order? Every McDonald's I've ordered from will have either breakfast items on the menu or their lunch and evening items on the menu. Fix your Uber menu. This is crazy to me also how someone can be on break and literally know other employee in the restaurant looks at orders or prepares orders. Like don't you have a protocol for like, you know, knowing when orders come in? And getting the customers their food?",

I waited 18 minutes for a Jr chicken and a smoothie. I went up to the counter to ask how long as people who ordered after me were getting their meals and let's be real 18 minutes for two items at McDonald's is beyond ridiculous. Was ignored by several employees. Finally got the attention of one of them and was treated poorly as if I was lying. 20+ minutes for two items is ridiculous. The food was awful, no lettuce, super soggy. This place needs new management immediately as it clearly shows the staff they have now were not trained properly and cannot handle the work load (wasn't busy at all). You go to McDonald's and don't really expect top notch service etc but this was baffling.",
