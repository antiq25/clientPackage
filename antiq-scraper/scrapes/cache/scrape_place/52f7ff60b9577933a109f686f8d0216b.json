Lawrence, the project manager organized every detail with precision, expedience in a highly organized manner. From the project onset of determining measurements and multiple components to the installation finality, a meticulous approach occurred throughout each task. The project's professional installers, Jhoemar and Juan completed my vinyl sheet installations with perfection. Their politeness, hard work ethic, and installation knowledge was remarkable.\nBC Floors is a Five Star company that most certainly places customers as their priority! Lawrence is a highly detailed and professional project manager who is extremely knowledgeable with customer's requirements.\nI very much recommend BC Floors for any of your flooring needs.",
