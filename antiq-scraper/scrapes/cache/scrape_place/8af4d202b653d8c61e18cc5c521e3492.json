I went up to the counter to ask for a side of onions because there were none on the burger I ordered and the STORE MANAGER Samira? said they can't do that because THEY COME WITH THE PATTY? (I know this isn't true). I said okay so you have onions? She said yes. I said okay so why can't I get a side of them and she continued to say because they come with the patty's.. makes no sense, especially if you can get them without. She even asked \"how are you going to pay for them?\" Like what?! I paid for my burger that was supposed to have them on there already and now I have to pay for them? But I thought I couldn't get a side of onions? So I went and finished my meal, came back and showed her the ingredients on the McDonald's site that say my burger should have come with them. I showed her my receipt that said no onions on the happy meal and mine had no modifications. I said if you can't give me onions on the side then you should have offered to remake my burger. She proceeded to say that they could remake my burger but this was after I ate. I don't know why she couldn't just give me some onions on the side. Small issue, but the terrible customer service and lies are the reason for this review. Not only that but as busy as it was, our patty's were not fresh and the fries were just above luke warm and not fresh either. Nuggets were good. I should have taken photos, but I wasn't thinking of leaving a review until after we ate. If you live in the area, 2725 Barnet Hwy, Coquitlam, BC V3E 1K9 is a much better location to visit. The store manager there is amazing.",

So I waited for another 5 minutes and I'm done with my patience and asked a lady wearing a black uniform (I guess it was atleast a supervisor) about my situation,  again she didn't check my order # and asked me rudely \"what was in your order\",  at that time another employee came over and  looked at my order # and handed me my coffee 10 seconds later,  and it's not hot anymore which means it's prepared for a while already,  but no one cares about it.  Last time I visited this place I waited 15 minutes for the same thing.  This will be my last visit to this Mcdonalds. Terrible customer service,  always seeing them chatting and not focus on orders,  no wonder this place receive a lot of complaints about messing up orders.
