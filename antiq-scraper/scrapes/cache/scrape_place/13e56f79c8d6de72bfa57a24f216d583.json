As we were being seated we were asked where we are from and they confirmed that it was a special occasion. The exceptional service continued throughout the evening. The food was exquisite. Vegan fare rarely rises to such heights. Attention was paid to presentation, flavor combinations, and textures. The Beet tartar and the chickpea tofu stood out to my mind, but nothing was wanting. The desserts were luscious. The chocolate layer cake with crunchy bottom, orange gelee, and a sprinkle of salt to heighten the senses was, like the rest of the meal a delight for the eyes and senses on multiple levels. The pear tart was perfectly cooked with the fruit holding it's shape and texture, not too sweet, with a touch of cinnamon. I enjoyed a non-alcoholic beer and an NA gin and tonic that were recommended and I would gladly order again. My partner really enjoyed her whiskey cocktail (with alcohol) and her recommended glass of white wine. We will happily be back.",

As we were being seated we were asked where we are from and they confirmed that it was a special occasion. The exceptional service continued throughout the evening. The food was exquisite. Vegan fare rarely rises to such heights. Attention was paid to presentation, flavor combinations, and textures. The Beet tartar and the chickpea tofu stood out to my mind, but nothing was wanting. The desserts were luscious. The chocolate layer cake with crunchy bottom, orange gelee, and a sprinkle of salt to heighten the senses was, like the rest of the meal a delight for the eyes and senses on multiple levels. The pear tart was perfectly cooked with the fruit holding it's shape and texture, not too sweet, with a touch of cinnamon. I enjoyed a non-alcoholic beer and an NA gin and tonic that were recommended and I would gladly order again. My partner really enjoyed her whiskey cocktail (with alcohol) and her recommended glass of white wine. We will happily be back.",

Every dish was full of flavour, texture, and tastiness! The only dish we thought was okay was their dessert, but to top that off they had the best rhubarb caramel (which we would love to purchase, except they said that wasn't possible ughhh). Would definitely revisit Folke again. Their service was also exceptional and the food came out really fast as well!",

If I wasn't already vegan, this dining experience would have surely turned me. Also, next level gourmet tater tots; tapioca mushroom dumpling were insane; fried chickpea tofu... so fantastic. We got the tasting menu which was incredible at only $85 CAD and little morsels of a bunch of different dishes so you get to try a lot of variety but plenty of food left us satisfied and full by the time dessert came.

My least favorite was the heirloom tomatoes but it wasn't because it didn't taste good, it just wasn't very memorable.\n\nIf you're a vegan or want to try to clean the bilges so to speak this is definitely worth a try. We paired it with a bottle of the Kutatas Viz (recommended by the server because they were out of the rose we wanted).
