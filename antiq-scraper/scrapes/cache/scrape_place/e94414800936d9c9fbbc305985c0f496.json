Upon checking in we were greeted by staff who had seen us pull into the parking lot and park our car. They had also heard us talking about the parking lot and that we were impressed to find parking that late in the evening, as it took a very long time to check in. Upon checking in they asked all the usual questions. The hotel proceeded to text all throughout the night and next morning making sure everything was fine with our stay, which it was for the most part. We spent the evening coming and going from the hotel and making multiple trips to our vehicle which was parked in view from the lobby with the staff that had checked us in hours prior, and a friendly door person who checked on us each time which we appreciated as two young female travelers. The next morning we woke up early and when to grab something from the car, to find that the car was gone. We went back inside and had staff tell us that they had got the car towed because it was illegally parked. We went to retrieve the car and had to navigate our way around a large unfamiliar city to a not so nice side of town and had to pay over $160 for less then 12 hours of the car being there. Once we retrieved the car and found our way back to the hotel I went back in to figure out parking. I had to wait for the three staff members to bring out two more staff members before I even got to speak to them. Once their crew of five was ready I asked them what was up with the parking and why nobody had mentioned that we needed to purchase a ticket for parking and why nobody had bothered to tell us our car was being taken. They did don't have a response. They then tried to charge us extra for parking the night our car got towed, to which one of the workers told the person billing me to be nice and not overcharge. This was a horrible experience as we were on a time sensitive trip and this completely ruined our day timing wise. We had stayed there before with male counterparts and were treated much better, but when it was two young female they feel the need to try and get more money out of us and deceive us.",
