It is a tasty meatball made with pork and bamboo shoots and other good flavoured stuff wrapped in a chewy, bouncy, starchy coating similar to a mochi texture. It's almost like a giant dumpling and it is delicious.\n\nThe beef noodle soups with thick noodle were just average because there was a thick layer of oil on the soup that was too greasy (if they could just skim off the oil it would be much better in my opinion so you can get to the tasty broth without so much oil). The noodles were also overdone to the point they would snap when you picked it up and they were mushy to eat. The noodles were so soft you couldn't even chew them.\n\nThe deep fried pork intestines were very tasty but the portion was quite small for what you pay. The milk teas were average. The Taiwanese deep fried chicken nuggets tasted authentic.",

A few days ago, I heard from a friend that this restaurant was opening in Vancouver, and we were filled with excitement. On the day of their official opening, to avoid the crowded crowd, we arrived at five o'clock. The restaurant's decor is simple, but the advertising slogans and pictures on the walls are quite interesting. We ordered some Taiwanese snacks that we had been longing for, including TW Meatball W Pork Bamboo Shoot, Deep Fried Boneless Chicken Thigh Rice, Spicy Pork Ear Slice, and MARINATED BAMBOO SHOOTS. All the dishes still retained the authentic Taiwanese style and flavor. We all enjoyed our meal. When it was time to pay, because they were newly opened, they were selling a Super Value Coupon Book, buy 50 get 50. Each five-dollar voucher came with a note: \"$5 Vouchers can only be used per person per transaction.\" I even asked the staff at that time how to use them. However, to our surprise, when we went to eat there again yesterday, the staff insisted from start to finish that the three of us could only use two five-dollar vouchers. This statement completely contradicted the clear and straightforward rule: \"$5 Vouchers can only be used per person per transaction.\" When we asked the staff for an explanation, she said, \"We have always done it this way.\" \"Always\"? You just opened recently. We feel this is a deceptive practice and are very disappointed. We hope this company can provide a reasonable explanation.\n\nNote: Thank you, owner , for such a quick response and for resolving our concerns so clearly. I believe excellent quality and honest treatment of customers are important driving forces for a prosperous business.",
