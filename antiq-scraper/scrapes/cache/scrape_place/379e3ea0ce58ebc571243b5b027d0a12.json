I asked if I could have a bag but I was denied a bag. The reason was I didn't tell them I wanted a bag when I ordered. I didn't know I had to request a bag nor was I asked if I wanted one when I ordered. Basically I was left with two burning hot hash browns while driving. Extremely poor service and rude.",

Friendly, smiling, upbeat and a pleasure to see each time we would grab a coffee or breakfast. I give them 5 stars\nBut in the evenings the kids working are robotic, impersonal, and do not exhibit the friendly helpful manners of customer service. The ice cream machines always broken. I cant get less ice in my drink, even when i request it. The cold drinks have more ice than soda, yet mcdonalds limits the drink orders because they dont have enough ice. It was hot out, we were all thirsty, and only 4 out of five of us were allowed to buy a drink. I couldn't order any cold drink even if I didnt want ice in mine.\nIf mcdonalds used less ice in the fountain drinks, customers could get enough liquid to wash down their meal, and they could hydrate more customers. But they dont have what their signs have advertising 60% of the time. Gets frustrating",
