There has been several times I contacted them on the phone and they did not even pick up the call. To me seems like that they don't even want to be there. If I could give them 0 stars I would.

Extremely slow service here and they don't answer their phones. After multiple attempts to reach them I eventually had to get the store manager involved to help me get a hold of the pharmacy. Even with the store managers help, the pharmacy still did not contact me. Feeling frustrated.\n\nI went in person to discuss my concerns with the pharmacy manager (Pouria Jalily), I asked for my prescriptions so I can deal with a pharmacy that will have better customer service. He did not want to listen to my concerns and was happy that I was willing to go somewhere else. He did not provide me with my prescriptions and advised me that my new choice of pharmacy will have to contact them directly to receive my information, he then tells me good luck in a very sarcastic manner.\n\nGo somewhere else for your pharmacy needs.",

Extremely slow service here and they don't answer their phones. After multiple attempts to reach them I eventually had to get the store manager involved to help me get a hold of the pharmacy. Even with the store managers help, the pharmacy still did not contact me. Feeling frustrated.\n\nI went in person to discuss my concerns with the pharmacy manager (Pouria Jalily), I asked for my prescriptions so I can deal with a pharmacy that will have better customer service.

I would give them my script, get told 45min-1hr and would never get my script before 5/6hrs often being told to wait again for an extra 15min. Of course it was never 15minutes more like 30-45minutes. When I finally could pickup my script I would tell them I have had this script several times before, but would still try and call the pharmacist over to give me instructions; how ridiculous!",
