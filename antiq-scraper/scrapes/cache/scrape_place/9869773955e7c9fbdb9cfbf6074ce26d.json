The food was very bland, the patty of my burger way too thin and dry - almost burned, and basically there was just vegetables and an admittedly tasty brioche bun. Fries were good. I'm not expecting a gourmet burger at a brewery of course, but what I was served was unacceptably poor in quality, especially considering that it cost about 22-23$. Vibe of the place was ok, but definitely not a place I'd visit again if the philosophy behind it remains the same.

During our visit a few days ago in the afternoon, the restaurant wasn't busy at all, but we had to wait an unusually long time before our orders were taken.

To make matters worse, the staff added an 18% tip to our bill without informing us beforehand, despite the subpar service we received.

They have an extensive beer menu (as you would expect). The food menu is also extensive with fairly typical food options for this type of establishment (burgers, wings, pizza, etc.). I had the 1/2 ribs and they were phenomenonal. The meat was super tender and just fell off the bone. What made the accompanying fries so good was a tomato/garlic dipping sauce, which was sublime. They should bottle and sell that stuff! I'm not sure what the rest of the menu was like, but for the ribs alone it's worth trying! The service as slick and professional. I could easily have stayed for a couple more beers if I wasn't fighting jetlag.",

I guess I'm still getting use to the new inflation prices which doesn't really make the food seem worth the price.  The prices are pretty good for happy hour.
