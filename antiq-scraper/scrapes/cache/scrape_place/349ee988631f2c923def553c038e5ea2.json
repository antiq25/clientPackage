It is a known fact that McDonald employees making your food are not required to wear gloves and only have to wash their hands once every hour (highly doubt they even do).

BUT, I stopped by this morning before breakfast ends and there was a man in a dress shirt standing in front (I think possibly manager?). He rearranged himself down there near the belt area and scratched his nose repeatedly multiple times and proceeded to help another man make food in the back without washing his hands or wearing gloves.
