The poor review though is based on the fact that while I was paying for my items the salesperson started spraying a strong smelling cleaner on the counter right beside my items.  I asked her to keep it away and moved my items aside but she continued.  I should have stopped right there and returned the unprotected perches and toys.  Now I have them home and they do have a distinct smell.  I don't know what this product was but anyone who knows anything about birds knows that they are extremely vulnerable to toxins, inhaled or ingested. So I guess I'll be back tomorrow to return the 2 I didn't detag and I guess I'm out of luck on the other one and the two non returnable toys.  Pretty dumb move for a pet store.",

I admit that many times I arrive only to see products on the shelves not stocked however to avoid making my trip a complete waste of time to I pick up some treats or a sweater. The staff is not always knowledgable with information on items or when items will arrive however they love animals so much that I continue coming back and giving them another chance. In early December I noticed an event dedicated to getting your pets photo taken with Santa.  Excited for this day I ordered a special holiday sweater for my cat and rallied up 2 other friends with pets. On the day of we arrived with pets dressed in holiday ware only to learn that the event was cancelled that day because they couldn't find a Santa Claus costume. My latest negative experience is where I draw the line. The particular cat food Coco eats is always out of stock. I came in twice in one week only to find the shelf empty. The manager placed an order for me and promised me it would arrive on Thursday. I came on Saturday to see that empty shelf but surprisingly a case was behind the cashiers desk. When I inquired about the case I was told it was reserved for somebody else. I was told this by the same person (a manager) who assured me I would have the special ordered cat food waiting for me. It didn't make any sense why someone else was getting special treatment over Coco and I. It made me feel incredibly uncomfortable and unfairly treated. She had no suggestions or solutions to this issue. I don't think this location is properly trained and knowledgeable enough to run a successful business. Clearly the management needs to step it up first before this could happen. It's really sad that animals suffer the most because of this.",

            "review_text": "For three years this is been my go to for all of my pets needs. I admit that many times I arrive only to see products on the shelves not stocked however to avoid making my trip a complete waste of time to I pick up some treats or a sweater. The staff is not always knowledgable with information on items or when items will arrive however they love animals so much that I continue coming back and giving them another chance. In early December I noticed an event dedicated to getting your pets photo taken with Santa.  Excited for this day I ordered a special holiday sweater for my cat and rallied up 2 other friends with pets. On the day of we arrived with pets dressed in holiday ware only to learn that the event was cancelled that day because they couldn't find a Santa Claus costume. My latest negative experience is where I draw the line. The particular cat food Coco eats is always out of stock. I came in twice in one week only to find the shelf empty. The manager placed an order for me and promised me it would arrive on Thursday. I came on Saturday to see that empty shelf but surprisingly a case was behind the cashiers desk. When I inquired about the case I was told it was reserved for somebody else. I was told this by the same person (a manager) who assured me I would have the special ordered cat food waiting for me. It didn't make any sense why someone else was getting special treatment over Coco and I. It made me feel incredibly uncomfortable and unfairly treated. She had no suggestions or solutions to this issue. I don't think this location is properly trained and knowledgeable enough to run a successful business. Clearly the management needs to step it up first before this could happen. It's really sad that animals suffer the most because of this.",
