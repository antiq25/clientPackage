Their service was lacking a bit as well. They also have a promo going on right now for 1 dish with a drink for $18 which is a good deal! Overall food was good, just disappointed I couldn't try their stuffed wings.",

We now have two kinds of chicken wing dishes,one is our michi stuffed wings and the other one is our new item\"grilled whole wings\". Your were ordering the \" grilled wings\", but  unfortunately our grilled wings are sold out today, and we had mention to you that our regular michi is still available today. However you didn't order the regular michi. And the table after you saw was also the regular michi, not the grilled wings.  We will definitely take your feedback into consideration as we continue to work hard to improve. It would be great if we could chat over email - michiyvr@gmail.com , I look forward to hearing from you!!   ",
