They don't ding you for bags and cups and pocket the money. The only negative that I really have is that they never, ever, ever put condiments in your bag. You always have to ask for everything and when you're in a hurry, One often forgets to ask. It is especially bad when they bring it to your car, then you have to go inside to get ketchup anyway. Would be really great if they fixed that.",
