We were looking for sashimi grade fish, particularly Hamachi.  They don't have it at the time, but they introduced Shima Aji, which was pretty close to what we were looking for, and we were glad to follow their recommendation.  We also purchased  Bluefin tuna, and of course the toro was very fresh.  We were very happy with the quality of sashimi grade fish we got there, and will definitely visit the place again the next time we go to Vancouver.  Thank you Seafood City.",
