I am a big fan of their vermicelli bowls, and the fried spring rolls are amazing. I love that they do the crispy thick wrapper, whereas many restaurants do thinner wrap.\n\nI ordered a grilled chicken with spring roll vermicelli bowl for take out, however there was some miscommunication as when I got home I realized they gave me pork. Regardless, it was so good that I ended up dining in the next day. This time I successfuly got the grilled chicken and it was also delicious. I've tried their pho in the past and it is a good standard bowl of pho.\n\nThe restaurant is clean, feels new, and our server was attentive and nice. Will be ordering from here whenever I crave Vietnamese!",
