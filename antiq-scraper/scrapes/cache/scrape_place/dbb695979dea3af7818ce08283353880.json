I was happy to be able to visit them on the first day of arriving and had sampled their offerings previously. My ONLY gripe is you can't purchase single cans and only 4 packs... for those that want to sample all the to go offerings, you either walk away empty handed, or empty walleted.. regardless, their hot dogs are fantastic and their beer is the best you will get in Van.",
