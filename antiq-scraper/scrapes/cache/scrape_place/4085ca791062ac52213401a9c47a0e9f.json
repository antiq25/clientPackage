We went straight from the train station to the restaurant and had the best meal of our trip so far. The crab baguette was fantastic. Crusty yet soft baguette with an explosion of flavors. The fennel slaw added an amazing crunch and flavor. We also had the salmonito wrap. Fresh and fantastic - the salmon was cut right then and there to make our wrap. The fries were excellent too and we dipped them in the housemade tartar sauce. The staff was incredible and made sure we were happy with our food. I don't often leave reviews but this was too good not to note. Take the time to visit this slightly out of the way spot. You won't be disappointed. I'm hoping my first visit to Vancouver won't be my last because I'll be dreaming of this food for awhile.",

To say it was superb would be an understatement. The perfectly fried Arctic Char exceeded all my expectations. It was succulent and full of flavour, pairing harmoniously with the crispy chips. This dish struck a perfect balance between the delicate fish and the satisfyingly crunchy chips. Its like a perfect balance between trout and salmon in taste.\n\nThis was, without a doubt, the best Arctic Char Fish and Chips I have ever had in Canada. Their tartar sauce is also to die for they now sell it in mason jars great choice.\n\nRating: 5/5 Stars",
