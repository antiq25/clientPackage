I was greeted by friendly staff who were genuinely interested in helping me achieve my fitness goals. They took the time to understand my needs and provided valuable advice without pushing me into any unnecessary commitments. It was evident that they genuinely cared about creating a positive and inclusive environment for all members. The equipment at this gym is also really good, with a ton of options. The cleanliness of the gym was commendable too, and I appreciated the staff's efforts in maintaining a hygienic space. One incident that really stood out to me was when I encountered a small issue with one of the machines. I approached a staff member and they walked with me to the machine right away and then told the maintenance team. I think what sets this gym apart from other places I've been is really the positive and motivating atmosphere. The members here are friendly and supportive, creating a sense of community that is often lacking in other gyms. The trainers are approachable and always willing to offer guidance, making sure that you get the most out of your workout routine. To sum it up, despite the negative feedback, my personal experience has been nothing but positive. I encourage anyone who might have been skeptical like I was to give it a chance. You might just be pleasantly surprised, just like I was! Overall, I highly recommend Fitness World Kingsway to anyone looking for a gym that offers quality equipment, helpful staff, and a welcoming atmosphere.",
