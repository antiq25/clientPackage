The owners changed (I think) but the name on the menu still bears the old Rose Garden name.\n\nNot so much of a hidden gem as this place was busy when we visited. Nice that they have live seafood available. The lobster in ginger and green onion sauce on noodles was really good.\n\nThe interior decor isn't fussy. Good option for take-out too.",
