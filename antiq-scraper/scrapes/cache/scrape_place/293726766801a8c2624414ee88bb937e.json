I am NEVER coming back to have my dogs groomed here and I wished I had read the reviews before handing my 4 legged babies over and spending over $880. My dogs and I have been both dramatized, abused and then made wronged for patronizing their business and asking for the services we paid for.   I should of just gone somewhere else as I feel so stupid for being taken as a fool for they basically stole money from us for services they never rendered. When I asked them to do a redo or give me store credit, the staff gang up on you, surround you and then threaten to call the police and escort you out. These staff and Especially that passive aggressive grooming Manager Stephanie to deliver very little for what you pay for and then aggressively verbally attack you to keep the money.\n\nI had to come in with friends in a following visit and video record to recapture Stephanies behaviour and get her name. If this platform allowed video I would just post it and let Stephanie behaviour do all the describing for you.  In conclusion, this business will be going out of business soon if this is how this business operator conducts herself...as a desperate, desperate ghetto trashy individual that is willing to tarnish the reputation of petsmart for the money. Run! Away Do not trust her! As This is an absolutely horrible bully that has to resort to This outright criminal behaviour.\n\nThis store is not very busy and pretty quiet, so there should be no reason for the long waits for service or the terrible service. Maybe because they are so horrible, people do not come back and the store is mostly empty of business traffic. Moreover, their inventory is stale and overpriced by 15% to 35%, and their inventory can easily be found on Amazon but a lot cheaper and in better condition.

I am NEVER coming back to have my dogs groomed here and I wished I had read the reviews before handing my 4 legged babies over and spending over $880. My dogs and I have been both dramatized, abused and then made wronged for patronizing their business and asking for the services we paid for.   I should of just gone somewhere else as I feel so stupid for being taken as a fool for they basically stole money from us for services they never rendered. When I asked them to do a redo or give me store credit, the staff gang up on you, surround you and then threaten to call the police and escort you out. These staff and Especially that passive aggressive grooming Manager Stephanie to deliver very little for what you pay for and then aggressively verbally attack you to keep the money.\n\nI had to come in with friends in a following visit and video record to recapture Stephanies behaviour and get her name. If this platform allowed video I would just post it and let Stephanie behaviour do all the describing for you.  In conclusion, this business will be going out of business soon if this is how this business operator conducts herself...as a desperate, desperate ghetto trashy individual that is willing to tarnish the reputation of petsmart for the money. Run! Away Do not trust her! As This is an absolutely horrible bully that has to resort to This outright criminal behaviour.\n\nThis store is not very busy and pretty quiet, so there should be no reason for the long waits for service or the terrible service. Maybe because they are so horrible, people do not come back and the store is mostly empty of business traffic.

These last few visits i noticed that this store is slipping on some very key issues that they really need to improve.\n\nI would rate my last 3 visits as:  Horrible customer service!, rude, and UNsupportive staff members more interested in carrying on in very heated arguments  between themselves or customers with valid complaints. That Groomer named Stephanie is very rude to customers and her co-workers. Staff around her seemed very tired of her abusive & toxic ways. I feel sorry for co-workers. STEPHANIE ONLY CARES ABOUT MONEY, and not how she treats people.  I think this Stephanie brings on the drama with her bad business practices.\n\nI did not enjoy my last 3 visits and just left each time. I do not think i will be buying my next family pet from this store even though I live& work 5 minutes away.  I really felt a review had to be written to prevent any future escalations as it seem it was about to turn violent with all the hostility between dogs and people. I would stay away from this chaotic store.",
