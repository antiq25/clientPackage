You get rice under the pickled veggies and salad, the chicken and prawns were juicy and warm still and give a nice middle eastern taste. In the whole bowl you pretty much get a little bit of everything, sweet from the pomegranates, savoury from the chicken, spicy from the jalapenos, tangy from the pickled veggies and a good balance of rice and that great wet sauce on top!

This culinary gem, which we wholeheartedly recommend to all fellow food enthusiasts, is none other than the restaurant where we indulged in the freshest, healthiest, and most delectable dishes we've ever had the pleasure of savoring.\nThe restaurant's ambiance was cozy and welcoming, creating the perfect atmosphere for a memorable dining experience. However, what truly sets this place apart is its commitment to serving healthy yet incredibly delicious food. We were pleasantly surprised to discover an extensive menu filled with a variety of options to cater to various dietary preferences. As health-conscious individuals, we couldn't have been more delighted.\nOne of the standout dishes we had the pleasure of trying was the \"Grizzly's Catch.\" This seafood masterpiece was a true culinary delight. The perfectly seared fish was tender, flaky, and bursting with flavor. The accompanying fresh vegetables and light drizzle of sauce complemented the dish perfectly, making it a must-try for any seafood lover.\nAnother absolute winner was the \"Yogi's Paradise.\" This vegetarian dish was a symphony of flavors and textures. The combination of perfectly grilled tofu, sauteed vegetables, and a mouthwatering sauce made this dish an explosion of taste in every bite. It was a pleasant surprise even for us, non-vegetarians, and it showcased the restaurant's mastery in creating dishes that cater to all palates.\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of our dining experience was the exceptional service provided by Chef Ankit. His passion for food was palpable, and he went above and beyond to ensure that we were not only well-fed but also educated about each dish's preparation. His detailed explanations and friendly demeanor added a personal touch to our meal, making it all the more special.\nIn addition to the incredible food and service, we were also impressed by the restaurant's commitment to using fresh, locally sourced ingredients. It was evident that quality and health were top priorities in every dish they prepared.\nOur journey in Canada would not have been complete without this culinary adventure, and for that, we are deeply grateful to Chef Ankit and the entire restaurant team. We wholeheartedly recommend this establishment to anyone visiting the area. Whether you're a health-conscious diner or simply in search of a fantastic meal, this restaurant is a must-visit.
