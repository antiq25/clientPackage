Booking reservations was easy but we did wish we could have sat up in the roof top patio (if you do happy hour you could not book up there). We pretty much order everything on the happy hour menu to start us off and then proceed to order our dinner after. The food was great everything is fresh and tasted good. We had their raw oyster and cold seafood platter, with some other sides such as their beef ribs and calamari. We follow that up with some steaks and fish.

The West Coast platter was a bit of a disappointment, however. The seafood was not as fresh as I expected, especially the lobster and crab, which were both lacking in sweetness. The bone-in ribeye steak was cooked perfectly to medium rare and was very flavorful. The pistachio ice cream for dessert was icy, but it had a rich, nutty taste. The service was excellent, our server was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Overall, we had a very good dining experience, but I would have liked the seafood to be fresher.",
