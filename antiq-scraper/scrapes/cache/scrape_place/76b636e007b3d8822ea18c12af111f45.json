The service was quick, the food was fresh and you could tell the meats were marinaded in the curry due to the nice colour gradient from the protein. Super flavourful, the mild curry is basically non-spicy and everything was packed nicely and a good portion. Didn't get a photo of the naan as I was too hungry and forgot...

The pick up special was super generous, four big pieces of naan, and probably 3-4x the amount of rice and curry in the pic. All for 12.50.\n\nThe tandoori pizza was only OK. Good crust and nice charring on the bottom but bland cheese and tandoori pieces were also meh.\n\nGet the butter chicken.",

Give amazing portions for your buck with lots of flavours. Don't ever change your recipe or portions because this is too amazing.\n\nButter chicken: this is my favourite out of the two. Lots of flavours, chicken and spices. Don't forgot to ask for tomatoes, onions etc on the side. Also get their garlic naan! It matches so perfectly with this dish! Chicken was a bit dry, but I like to shred them into pieces. Love the amount of chicken\n\nChicken tikka masala: this is super delicious and have a more refreshing herb and spices taste to it. Has onions and peppers in the dish if you like more veggies in your dish.\n\nWould definitely come here again and order! The best butter chicken I had so far in Vancouver and highly recommend for those to come and try!",
