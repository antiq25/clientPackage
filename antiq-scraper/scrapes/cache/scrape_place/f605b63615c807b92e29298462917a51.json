The meal was rounded out with a refreshing cabbage salad and a warm, sweet cornbread. It was a truly satisfying and hearty meal that I would highly recommend to anyone curious about Nigerian cuisine.",

Giving a business 1 star review when we clearly didnt do anything wrong is not fair!\n\nFeel free to share your feedback with uber, but as a company we are very transparent and pride ourselves in delivering great services to our customers.",

This building is shared by 9 different take out only restaurants and you have to call them to bring out your order. There is free parking all along the street.\n\nI ordered the chicken shawarma through UberEats. The restaurant tried to reach me to tell me they ran out of chicken so some of it will be beef. I did receive a call but the caller ID automatically said \"suspected spam\" so I didn't answer. They were nice to write me a note with my order to let me know some things were changed. I did get to try both chicken and beef tough. The chicken was soft but the beef to me was a lot tougher. I prefer the chicken so I will try the chicken only again next time. I am a very big fan of sauce and if you like it too, this is a great place for you. The wrap is smothered in sauce and filled with meet and cabbage. If you cannot tolerate spice, the mild would still have a little spice as well. The large version was bigger than a shawarma wrap at other places. However, I found the original price very expensive as it was around $18 for a large wrap. The UberEats BOGO was a very good deal though.",

I couldn't even help myself, I just started eating because the food smelled so good. It tastes amazing 20/10 on presentation and taste. And the \"Christmas present\" was a nice touch as well. The candle smells divine. Will definitely be ordering in the future as well as recommending to everyone I know. Good Job Vansuya, keep up the good work.",
