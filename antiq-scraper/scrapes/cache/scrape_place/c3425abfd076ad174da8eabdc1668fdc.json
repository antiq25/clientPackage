Great selection of beer, definitely recommend the wings or pizza. $10 burger and beer on Tuesdays. Patio is super dog friendly. Water is self serve at the water station.",

Nice patio that's not on a loud, busy road. We had chicken strips and burgers and enjoyed them both. Out of the beers, I particularly liked the Session ale. We also scored some free deep-fried pickles when the kitchen closed as they made too many. Will definitely be back as it's a great, peaceful location on the Spirit Trail and easy walking distance to Mosquito Creek and Lower Lonsdale.",
