Over the last three months, the prices have getting higher so we started to track them. In fact, things like cottage cheese have gone up $1 in less than a month. We just went to Whole Foods to compare prices and the same brand butter, milk and other staples were at least $2 cheaper per item. As a neighborhood grocery store in a community which is not know for its wealth, $12 for butter and $9 for milk is outrageous. Increasing prices that quickly is uncalled for and a real scam. We won't be going back again.",
