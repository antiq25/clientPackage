Jonah, Theo and Sham gave us such an unreal experience at Hook. From the stunning drinks to the unreal shucking, the staff there treat their guests like family. Making sure to ask for your names and give you a good experience. Their seafood and oysters are the freshest I've ever had and the biggest oysters I've ever eaten in my life! This is the restaurant to go to not only for the food but for the service. Our new fave spot in the West End!",

The chef there is incredible talented, the staff was so friendly and attentive, and the manager Axel made sure it all ran smoothly. We watched the sunset through through the windows while everything unfolded perfectly. Everyone kept raving about the service, food and atmosphere. I would give more stars if I could. Thanks again for one of the best nights!!!",
