Middle aged chinese ladies shouting, pointing, no smiles and not acknowledging after we made any requests (for sauce, more tea, etc.).  We watched them do the same thing to everyone whether you spoke mandarin, cantonese or english .. it didn't matter. The dim sum was mediocre at best for the price.  The restaurant is new, modern and still clean for now.  With so many choices especially in the same area we won't be returning.",

The menu is updated with a few more specialty dishes added. It opens for dimsum and full dinner and is very popular with the locals so be prepared to wait during the weekend. Reservation is accepted. Parking is pretty much off the surrounding streets. Food is decent and services are energetic and efficient. Prices are reasonable and plate volume is decent so good value for family meals. Recommended if you are in the area with the  bakeries, groceries and medical centers around. Great for lunch and dinner.",

Which is why as a younger person, I need to advocate for the elderly. Our table was the youngest one, the rest are elderly people. Understand that geriatric patients often lose their sense of smell and taste and come with other health problems, HBP, diabetes, etc. As a community, we should be supporting everyone: local business and our community members. Two items are bad items: sui mai (meat stinks and is old, when you bring it near  to consumer it already had foul smell, the chiu chow dumpling was terribly made on a physical level but this is also the 2nd item that is foul (it was at a distance from me and I can already smell it from the table).\n\nMenu: needs to be updated to reflect their items. One error to note is squid tentacles in English but when served, its not tentacles and turns out the Chinese name is just squid. Fried quid tentacles is a rarity so if I see tentacles in English, I will order it. But it is not. You need to update the menu because that is flat out deceiving.\n\nStaff: The good, they have full staff. The bad, inefficient. I assume there is 1-2 front staff that is either the owner or affiliated with the small business because they CARE. They either huddle around and follow each other walking up and down (with the second person behind not doing anything and not looking around). There are quite a few staff that have dyed red hair. The long red hair literally yelled at me to give me the receipt so she can cross it off (this is when she served me \"squid tentacles\" and it was not tentacles, at that point, I asked my family if I red it wrong because clearly I remember seeing the word tentacles and thought perhaps they are giving us the wrong order. The other 2 red hair ladies have short hair, one with a similar haircut from TVB Moonlight Resonance main villain (ah Hung) tends to do cleanup and will ignore any hand waiving at all times. Regardless, poor service from the short red hair staff.\n\nFor the two ladies that have long hair and straight black hair, they were efficient but may also be affiliated with the small business.\n\nTea: after one round, tea flavor is gone. It took the 3rd person to finally give us new tea leaves.\n\nPayment: tea was waived, I assume its new opening so they are waiving. When asked to pay, they said if I can pay cash because tea is waived. I said no, the staff did not look happy. In a business perspective, some businesses understand that cashless payment versus cash is inevitable and understands the charges for the fees. This comes with the territory of opening a business. Either that, go cash only and understand you will be working with specific niche if that's the way you want to go.\n\nUses Clover POS system but doesn't take Apple watch payment (tried several times but it says try again). Physical card tap works, had to take out my debit card for transaction to go through.\n\nRice roll never came, I asked them to take it off the menu. But she said she'll followup; however, I had to tell her firmly to take it off (this was right after the the 2nd item came and was foul). She respectfully said to take it off the menu and also came back with the rice rolls but I was firm and said I don't want it anymore. After I paid, I then told her about the foul food items to which they said, why didn't you tell us? Typical Chinese way will always be \"I'll give you a new one\" which is what I'm not interested. I was then given a to-go box of pastries free of charge (again turned it down). I have dignity and pride giving honest food reviews and I come from moral values. And I'm also not those terrible customers that take advantage of businesses either for getting free food (to that I say they are scammers).",
