She brought a small grocery bag size of soft plastics that are appropriate for recycling. It is not feasible to bring a little ziploc bag of plastic everytime so we bring it when we collect a small grocery bag size. The Indian guy today even said that it is only for \"packaging for products that are being sold by London Drugs\" only and not for any other soft plastic. So much for trying to do our part in a greener planet. Very disappointed in the lack of customer service.",

Rest assured that we do indeed take in grocery bad sized soft plastics for recycling and will remind our front-end staff about that policy.

It's unfortunate that the service you received was not up to your expectations and that the quality of the enlarged photos was not satisfactory. It's good that we refunded your money, but it's understandable that you would have preferred to have the issue with the photos corrected rather than just receiving a refund.
