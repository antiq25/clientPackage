The young lady before me had purchased 4 large size ice coffee and the coffees were placed onto a very soft, poor quality paper tray. Due to the heavy weight, the tray broke in half and the 4 coffees spilled on the ground. The young lady asked the manager if she could get a replacement and have someone to clean up the floor. However....the manager said back to her \"can you get the mop from the washroom and clean it up yourself?\" The young lady was stunned and overwhelmed that the manager actually told her to go clean up the mess. The manager continues to say that \"in here, whoever makes the mess gotta clean up themselves.\" The young lady was also shocked and said \" excuse me, but what?\" Seeing the customer unsatisfied, the manager said \"okay, you can clean it up and I will tell someone (a worker) to help you.\"  This left me speech, I have never seen customer service like this anywhere else. This is West Van, I just think this location has ruined the reputation/face of park royal.",
