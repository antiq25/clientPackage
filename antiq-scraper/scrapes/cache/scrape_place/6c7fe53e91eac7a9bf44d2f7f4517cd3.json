It's a nice spot in Chinatown area with clean but cozy aesthetics.\n\nThe waiter was friendly and very fast and the food was pretty great.\n\nI got their Maialona sandwich which was fantastic. I wish they went heavier on the pesto but other than that, it was very tasty.\n\nWe also got Cotoletta sandwich and Pappardelle al Ragu di Cinghiale. I thought that the ragu could have had more meat and I've had better pappardelle noodles, but the sauce was good.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience here and would come back!",

We said we wanted to get their $55 tasting menu and they picked a delicious selection from their menu to try. Everything was seriously great. I will return very soon to try their lunch menu, which features sandwiches using the amazing Pane Casalingo bread!\n\n1) Arancini - well balanced risotto balls with delicate flavours topped off with a nice pesto sauce\n2) Pane Casalingo - this bread is seriously amazing and why I'm going to go back soon to try their lunch. They serve sandwiches with this bread at lunch!\n3) Panzanella (missing from photos, too busy enjoying food) - nice fresh salad with a sweet sherry vinaigrette. I love the vanilla pickled strawberries they add in there.\n4) Carpaccio - high quality beef with  \"ubriacato di vino\" buffalo cheese\n5) Rosticciana - braised ribs where the meat just falls off the bone with a gentle nudge. The smoked cherry glaze was so amazing I had to stop myself from licking the plate.\n6) Ravioli al Nero di Seppia - squid ink ravioli with sweetcorn that pairs so nice with the lobster and prawns\n7) Coccoli e Proscuitto - this is a ** MUST TRY **. Deep fried dough is very unique and paired with whipped stracchino cheese and 18 month Prosciutto di Parma makes it an incredibly delicious must try.\n8) Gnocchetti - excellent texture on this Gnocchetti, which is a smaller gnocchi. The flavours are wonderful. I loved that there was a bit of spicy kick to it.\n9) Torta all'olio - I love the citrus from the orange balancing out the slight sweetness of the cake\n10) Tiramisu - this Tiramisu is very nice. It has a darker espresso flavour, not acidic, which I really like and the cake overall is sweet, but definitely not overly sweet.",

Carpaccio was good, with pine nuts and arugula and cheese, a perfect combination withe my red. The place is so cool, table set ups, nice simple decorations. Awesome ambiance. Service was very good too. Will come back to this place.",

We had two cocktails and the carpaccio, it was the best I've had in my life. The timing was great, the bartender serving us was super attentive, so at no point did we feel rushed.\n\nWe love it so much we returned the next morning to try their sandwich menu. Fresh ingredients, chill vibe, and the verde nigroni was delicious.\n\nThanks to the team for a lovely meal!",
