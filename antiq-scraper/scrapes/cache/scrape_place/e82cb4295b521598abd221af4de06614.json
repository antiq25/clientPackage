The malpeque and beausoleil  were harvested on the 15th and 18th respectively.\n\nPlease reach out via email orders@dailycatchseafood.ca , we would love to make it up to the both of you!\n\nwarm regards,\n\n",

I especially enjoyed the local oysters and the fresh sashimi-grade tuna. The prices were very reasonable, and they had good deals on the specials of the day.\n\nI also appreciated the shop's commitment to sourcing sustainable seafood. It's always good to know that the seafood I'm purchasing is not only delicious but also responsibly sourced.\n\nOverall, I had an excellent experience at Daily Catch and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for high-quality and sustainable seafood.

The freshness and quality of the seafood they sell is outstanding. They had variety of species to choose from and were all expertly handled and packaged. I especially enjoyed the local oysters and the fresh sashimi-grade tuna. The prices were very reasonable, and they had good deals on the specials of the day.\n\nI also appreciated the shop's commitment to sourcing sustainable seafood. It's always good to know that the seafood I'm purchasing is not only delicious but also responsibly sourced.\n\nOverall, I had an excellent experience at Daily Catch and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for high-quality and sustainable seafood. The customer service is top-notch and the seafood is outstanding. I will definitely be back!",

Unfortunately for him the other customer asked like 30 sec after i did and the other sales person said it was previously frozen. That sales person lied to me to sell that overpriced salmon. As this person who was cutting my salmon,I asked him again whether the fish was fresh . He looked lost and finally admitted it was previously frozen. Fish was old.  Apparently  since like November. I ended up buying a piece( for whatever stupid reason) for 15 dollars. Terrible experience and lying sales associate. Would not recommend this place!!! 0 out of 10",

When the staff were asked about the situation, the one helping you, thought you had asked \"If the fish was Cut Today\" and because it was he replied \"yes\". When you asked him \"if it was previously frozen\" he replied \"it was\" not because he was changing his mind or lying earlier but because in his mind he wasn't asked if it was fresh or frozen yet. The staff who was helping you has worked for us for a long time and knows that the salmon right now is not fresh, there is no incentive for him to lie about it so I honestly believe this is a miss communication on our part. Occasionally staff might miss-hear what a customer is saying, we serve thousands of customers a week so its bound to happen every once in a while. \n We are extremely transparent about our products. We don't hide the fact that this time of year we sell previously frozen wild Salmon as there is no fresh wild pacific salmon available for commercial purposes for several more months. All Wild Salmon being sold outside of Fresh Season is always going to be previously frozen, unless it is farmed. Our store Signage is also usually very accurate and products that are Fresh will say so. The more transparent we are the better business we become. Our employees have no incentive lying about our products it would only get them in trouble if done in anyway that isn't an honest mistake. For this reason and the employee in questions vast knowledge on our products I believe this was an honest mistake.\n As for the frozen Salmon its by far the highest quality Sockeye you can purchase outside of fresh season. We pay a lot more for it so that we can sell it with a smile knowing the quality is superb, we can guarantee you will enjoy it!\n We would love to here more from you as well as refund your purchase, Please Email us at Orders@dailycatchseafood.ca so we can connect, Thank You",
