Haven't had a OMG moment with a burger yet at this location. Recently got lured to go because of their $2 iced oreo coffee and their $1 fries. The iced Coffee had no oreo taste but at least it tasted like coffee right? Fries were fresh and crispy but under seasoned. Asked for more packs of ketchup but I guess he underestimated my ketchup usage for those bland tasting fries. I still have a good 55% of fries left after my packets of ketchup was done.",

Just two beef stacked and cheese at the very top. It made us feel nauseous after finishing it. It was not at all what the pictures on their website/menu showed.
