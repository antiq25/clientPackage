Quick service I guess with the time we went there, a little early for dinner. Table at the booth we sat down has a huge hole in it, washroom was really dark and dirty with sauce splat on the headboard Liked our server as she is attentive. Couple of stars off because 1. We ordered a plain fries for the kids but we got a season one that's a little spicy for little kids. 2. It gave me an upset stomach after I ate here that never happened to any seafood places I've been to.\nMight as well go to other boil places for better experience and atmosphere. Debating if I should give this place another try.",
