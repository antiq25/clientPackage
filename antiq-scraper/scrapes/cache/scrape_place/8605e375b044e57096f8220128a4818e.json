I saw them going into the cafe and many of the employees of the supply store they are located at. Had no idea it was at a lumber and hardware supply warehouse, surrounded by many other commercial warehouses, such a great surprise, which just makes it that much better. Absolutely loved the atmosphere and the owners. Very friendly older couple and their son run this awesome famiky owned cafe.\n\nAwesome home cooked breakfast, amazing friendly and relaxed service, and unbelievable atmosphere. When I got there, I was the only one, but I still loved it so much. The old school diner style furniture and music were awesome. I got the pancake with blueberries, sunny side up eggs, and sausage, which were all very good. Loved their old small glass coffee maker and the mugs. The son who was serving was very nice and friendly....he me told me that this place has been around since the 1940s and his parents got this place 15 years ago have been in the business for so long after they retired, wanted to have a slow and small place and now this place is exploded and is crazy busy ...which I find very funny and awesome.\n\nWill definitely come back to try their burgers and Chinese food.",

The menu offers a variety of comfort food options, and we opted for burgers and a side of poutine. The food was exceptional--each bite of the burger was a blend of flavors and textures, and the poutine was a delightful mix of crispy fries, cheese, and well-balanced gravy.\n\nWhat stood out, even more, was the service. The staff were attentive and courteous, enhancing the overall dining experience. It's evident why this establishment has garnered such high praise and even topped lists of the best places to eat in Canada.\n\nA particularly charming touch was the inclusion of watermelon slices with our meal. It added a refreshing contrast to the hearty fare and demonstrated the restaurant's attention to detail. Another delightful aspect was the handwritten reviews by children displayed on the wall, which actually helped us make our menu choices.\n\nNorthern Cafe lives up to its reputation.
