He was polite and quick and helpful.\n\nDisappointed with the restaurant however, the restaurant is in the food court and open till 9 pm. I was trying to order on the BK app for pick up at around 815 pm and the app said that you cannot order from this store, it's closed. I walked up into the food court and the store was open.\n\nIt's ridiculous that they shut down the online ordering portal hours before the store shuts down. Wasted 5 mins of my time waiting around for the order when I could have just ordered online. This isn't the first time this is happening, and it would be great if Bk management put a stop to this and allow people to order upto at least 845-855 pm on the app.",

He was polite and quick and helpful.\n\nDisappointed with the restaurant however, the restaurant is in the food court and open till 9 pm. I was trying to order on the BK app for pick up at around 815 pm and the app said that you cannot order from this store, it's closed. I walked up into the food court and the store was open.\n\nIt's ridiculous that they shut down the online ordering portal hours before the store shuts down.
