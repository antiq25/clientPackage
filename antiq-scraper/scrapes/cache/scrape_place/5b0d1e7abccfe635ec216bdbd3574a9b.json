(Packed a 2700-sq feet, 4-person house in 3-4 hours!)  For this most recent move, we also used their unpacking service, and man was I impressed!  The team was very thoughtful in where they put things and asked questions when they thought I may have a preference (since kitchen placement is so personal!). I especially appreciated how they removed all the boxes (from BBX moving), cardboard, and paper and put them in the carport, so the house felt ready to live in when they were done. So amazing!  (BBX Moving came and removed ALL the boxes and cardboard and trash the next day).\n\nLimor herself is always responsive, patient, and extremely pleasant to deal with. In the few times that I've worked with her, I  always get a sense that she works very hard, takes pride in her work, and has a very strong work ethic.\n\nAll in all, I would not hesitate to recommend them. Worth every penny!!",

You won't go wrong in hiring them.\n\nWe began with an on-site consultation where Limor walked through the house, took notes, asked questions about priorities, and provided suggestions on how to proceed. We decided to utilize her team for packing as well as some unpacking services. I am so very glad we did.\n\nIt was critically important for us that we minimize the chaos of the move for Dad. He has memory issues that make any change to his environment frustrating and confusing for him. Limor proposed that we split packing across two days and leave the key pieces like Dad's bedroom and his tv room for the last moment. Also, they photographed Dad's space and when unpacking they essentially recreated it in our new place so that he immediately felt at home. It was brilliant!\n\nI wish I had taken photos of the boxes they packed so you could see the attention to detail in their work. We did not lose a single piece to breakage, and we had around 200 boxes of goods being moved. Everything was labelled and colour coded. And their art inventory service is such a great idea, I highly recommend taking advantage of that too.\n\nI'm not going to tell you it was cheap because frankly it wasn't. But let's get real here: we hired trained professionals to provide a skilled service that supported our move and made our lives so much easier. I can tell you with absolute conviction that it was money very well spent, and we received excellent value for our investment.",

Because I move a lot for my work, I will hire them every time. I couldn't believe they had my entire condo packed up in 3.5 hours. They did an amazing job and followed exactly what I asked of them. So grateful to have this service. Worth every penny!!",
