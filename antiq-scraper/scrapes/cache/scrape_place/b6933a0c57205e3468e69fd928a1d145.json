The price is reasonable with the amount of food you get. We had shaken beef, tamarind soup and fried chicken. They were all perfectly cooked, just a bit too sweet for my taste. The restaurant was super crowded when we came for dinner. Service was a bit slow, probably due to crowd, but the staffs were really nice. The restaurant has authentic Asian vibe with round family tables.",

We loved our dishes so much that they were probably the best foods we had during her visit.\n\nWe had deep fried chicken wings, tong choy (water spinach), rare beef filet with anchovies and deep fried crab meat rolls.  I could eat the chicken wings and crab meat rolls all day long.  Al;though deep fried, the wings and rolls were light in texture but also full of flavours at the same time. The slightly sweet undertone in the coating of the chicken wing batter was addictive.\n\nWe came here on a Monday morning shortly after 1100 when they open and we walked right in.
