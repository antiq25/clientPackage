            "review_id": "I've always thought this restaurant seemed fun and got to give it a try today. The wooden interior is cozy and I feel like the decor is evoking a little bit genuine nostalgic feel and also a little humour. Our waiter was super nice and the other staff was also friendly. Walking to the washroom takes you right past the kitchen, which is interesting to take a look at but also may give some peace of mind that you can easily see exactly what's going on in there.\nTheir menu is mostly the basic Thai dishes that you see at casual Thai restaurants in Canada, but I was really curious about their take on fish & chips and poutine, which sounded very unique compared to both other Thai food and the Canadian versions of these dishes. So this time I tried Bob's Fish & Chips: fried battered cod pieces topped with sliced mango, onion, basil, and chilies with two crispy curry rice cakes, in a tangy sauce. It's not a dish you'd recognize as fish & chips without the context, but I can see where the inspiration was drawn from. I thought it was really tasty! The vinegar sauce was zippy and refreshing and I really liked the flavour and crunchy \"crust\" of the rice balls. When I first got a look at it I was skeptical that it was really enough food to be worth $22, but the way they stacked the fish pieces was deceiving because there was actually a lot of fish, and I was fully satiated after finishing. I also tried their house tamarind ginger soda which was very good too! I was expecting it to be spicy like ginger beer and it was really mostly sweet because the tamarind is more pronounced than the ginger, but still a tasty and refreshing drink.\nMy friend got the Chicken Cashew Nut for her meal and enjoyed it as well. There was enough that she ate only half and saved the rest (although she's not a big eater - I think with my appetite I could've finished it or nearly finished it but been very full).\nI'd say it's a safe bet for standard downhome Thai food, and if you want to get a little experimental, the Fish & Chips is definitely worth trying. The positive atmosphere ties it all together.",

Also had a Thai iced tea which was refreshing and was the perfect level of sweetness.\n\nService was also amazing - they were attentive, responsive, and quick to do the small things like remove chopstick/straw wrap from the table and bring take out containers.\n\nI definitely recommend Bob Likes Thai Food, and will go again!",
