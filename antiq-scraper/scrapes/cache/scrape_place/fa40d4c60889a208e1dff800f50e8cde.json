The food I had was mid; chili cheese nachos mid, jbc mid, the ceaser salad was good tho. I just am rating 3 stars for the bathrooms. I dropped my keys in the urinal while I was pissing. So I fished them out and threw them into the sink and went to wash them with soap there was no soap! I think your bathrooms are cursed. I am now having to drive home with piss dripping from my keys onto me.",
