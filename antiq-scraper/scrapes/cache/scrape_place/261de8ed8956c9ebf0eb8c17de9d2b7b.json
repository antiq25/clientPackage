I don't know how, but I even touched on topics that I thought about but didn't voice. It feels like everything is falling into place. She approached everything very thoroughly, carefully leads the session, you can feel sincere immersion and interest!\n\nBut the main thing is what conclusions I made and where to go for at least the next couple of years. Because of the events in Ukraine, I had to start my life from scratch and of course there were questions about whether I should continue to engage in the same activities and whether I was on my way, the consultation helped me understand all this\n\nMany thanks ",
