Working with Fraserview was extremely easy and the staff prioritize their customers and truly want you to have the best experience.\n\nThe hall itself is a stunning venue with chandeliers throughout the hall, a massive elevated dancefloor, modern carpeting, high quality speaker system and a gorgeous outdoor balcony that my guests enjoyed majority of their evening taking pictures outside on a sunny day.\n\nI can't thank the Manager Antony enough for his exceptional customer service. He is solely the reason why I booked both of my events at Fraserview Hall. I had other deposits at another competing hall but Antony ensured me that I was in good hands and now that my events are over I can 1000% say that Fraserview Hall exceeded my expectations. My family and friends are now booking Fraserview Hall for their events after attending mine. It was the most glamorous Haldi and Wedding Reception I've ever experienced and booking Fraserview Hall was the best decision!\n\nThe in house DJ was wonderful and played beautiful songs that my guests and myself could dance all night to. I highly recommend booking the in house DJ, they are very organized and prepare all your songs to make sure everything runs smoothly.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious, my guests had second helpings and several people told me their favourite items were the vegetable chow mein, fish pakora, chicken tikka, goat curry and bbq tandoori chicken.\n\nI also really enjoyed working with the Decor team. They truly worked their magic and made every detail look absolutely perfect. My Haldi night looked like a Bollywood movie set with all the beautiful bright colours, umbrella arch, glittery table runners, gold elephants and fancy decor pieces.\n\nThey also created the most stunning set up for my Reception which included a hanging floral and crystal walkway, floating candles, chandeliers, white roses with an elegant backdrop for the stage. They upgraded and sourced gorgeous decor and took care of everything. I am grateful for the hard working staff, especially Harmeet and Shrungerri who executed my visions and made them better! My advice to anyone booking Fraserview Hall is to trust the staff, they know what they are doing and you will not be disappointed.",

We could not find parking so parked in the lot across the street and when he saw us approaching, he let us know that we should move our vehicle, as it would get towed.  During our conversation, we mentioned that we had a handicap parking decal, and he immediately offered us the parking spot that was reserved with pylons right next to the entrance of the hall. This is a level of courtesy that we usually do not see at these types of events. I appreciate Fraserview hiring staff members that care for their guests.",

With regards to the inconvenience caused due to the stair entry, incase you missed out I would like to highlight that we do have an elevator entrance for the hall also Music volume is maintained as per the requirement of the host, but we will for sure note this valuable feedback. Thank you for the review and we are looking forward to seeing you again in future. :)",
