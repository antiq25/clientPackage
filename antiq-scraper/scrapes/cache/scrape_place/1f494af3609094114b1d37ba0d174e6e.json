It is such an interesting flavor between the honey roasted walnuts and the Gorgonzola cheese. The sweetness of the honey wasn't overpowering it just gave it a unique flavor at the end of the bite. I would 100% go back just for this pizza.\n\nThe ambiance is so cozy and elegant yet funky inside. If it wasn't too hot, the patio would be a great option too, full of plants and it seemed like a spacious comfortable space.",
