AND THE BEST PART he got my husband to eat his vegetables after suggesting plate #3 when he couldn't decide what he wanted to try! That alone was well worth the stop. This place definitely earned 5 stars. Thank you so much We Grill. We look forward to visiting again when we come back and will be telling all our family and friends in the Yukon about your amazing food.

We Grill specializes in freshly made veggie samosas, and they are absolutely delicious.\n\nThe person working at the We Grill stall was friendly and welcoming, which made for a pleasant dining experience. I had the opportunity to try their veggie samosas, which were crispy on the outside and filled with a flavorful mixture of potatoes and spices on the inside. They were simply amazing and left me wanting more.\n\nI also had the chance to taste their fries, which were equally as delicious as the samosas. They were crispy and perfectly seasoned, making for a great side dish to the samosas.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend We Grill to anyone looking for tasty and authentic Indian cuisine in Vancouver. The freshly made veggie samosas and fries are a must-try, and the friendly staff make for a welcoming and enjoyable dining experience. Thank you to the staff at We Grill for a great meal.",
