This happened yesterday, at around 8 on August 19th. the employee was quite old and was a male with not much hair. if the manager or any worker is seeing this, please it would be very appreciated if you could talk to him or give him a warning as this type of behaviour is unacceptable as his job is to help customers, not accuse and shame.",
