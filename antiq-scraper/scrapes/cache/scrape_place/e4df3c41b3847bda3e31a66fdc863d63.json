She scanned the sticker with her scanner and said \"the system says it's $114.99, someone must have forgotten to change the sticker\". I mentioned that it should be sold for the advertised price and she said the price was already raised in the system, so that's how much it costs. I told her that I'm not interested in buying it then.
