Jose's service was great, even though it was a super busy night, but like in a good Italian restaurant I loved how we were not rushed and enjoyed our time. We hit yo try the crab tower, which I wouldn't have expected but flavor was incredible! One of the best Carpaccio's I've ever had, being one of my favorite Italian dishes and have had in many places and countries! flavor was absolutely on point, antipasto was excellent in every bite, followed by a fantastic and light Gnocchi with white sauce. I wish we had space to try the creme brulee, but we did take a Tiramisu to go and didn't disappoint! Atmosphere was lovely, restaurant was beautiful! It truly made our night in Vancouver, wish we could come back tomorrow but it was fully booked as well. Thank you so much! ",

The support staff were great but it felt like since we weren't 70 years old or buying the $500+ wine the waiter gave us basically no service. There are other places nearby to spend $100 per person for much better service.\n\nThe food was great, the lasagna especially",

Do yourself a favour and visit here at least once in your life. My gf and I shared the 38oz Porterhouse Fiorentina steak  and it was hands down the best steak we've ever had!! I also ordered their Calamari and then Cheesecake for dessert  yum \nFrom the wonderful service to the amazing chefs, dishes and environment this place is legendary. And oh, once it's nicer out book yourself a table in the outdoor villa area and it's just gorgeous outside. Cheers  to 2023 all!! ",
