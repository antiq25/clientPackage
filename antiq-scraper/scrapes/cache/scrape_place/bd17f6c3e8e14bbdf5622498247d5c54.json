I just had a chicken sandwich with a whole gigantic chicken breast in it. It was tender and spicy and came with delicious waffle cut fries, and I had a beer with it, all in a lovely diner with air conditioning and great ambiance.  I would love a bigger selection of local beer but on the rest I have no notes. Well done!",

The chicken inside the sandwich was juicy, crunch and well seasoned. The sauce and the slaw worked really well together. We ordered the OG hot chicken, hot and sweet honey garlic, and kids tenders. I personally liked the honey garlic sandwich more but the OG was also really tasty. Waffles fries were great too with a good portion size. Their house mayo was also delicious. Most of all, the lady who received our order was  so kind, attentive and friendly. The service was beyond 10/10. She even came to check how our food was and also to kindly interact with our son. Such a sweet gesture. The only criticism I have was that it was a bit cold in the restaurant. Got a tall can of beer with the chicken sammy, and this meal was so satisfying. Definitely going on my favourite restaurant list.",
