To be honest it's a little bit expensive to me as a student, but the food and its taste is definitely worth the price. The fish is fresh and tartar sauce is delicious and flavorful I'm so into it after the first taste.  I will probably pay Fish Cafe a second visit.",

The batter was crispy, fish was moist, perfectly seasoned! It was soooooo good, really hit the spot! Tartar sauce was light and refreshing, not heavy at all. I craved this again 3-4 times that same day, I'm still thinking about it today!\n\nWe also got the scallop, grilled, over rice, with garlic butter! Scallop was also perfectly cooked! Sweet and juicy! I enjoyed dipping the scallop in the butter and adding tartar sauce to the rice for the perfect bite!\n\nFood was a little slow but we went right when they open so it was understandable. I appreciate that the chef take his time to prepare the food properly instead of rushing them out.\n\nService was friendly and casual, very warm and welcoming! We enjoyed our conversation with them and our time there. This was also the first time we took our puppy to a restaurant, we were glad it was a pleasant experience.\n\nTheir supplies came late that day and we couldn't order what we originally wanted, but we would definitely be back for other dishes. What we ended up ordering turn out great though, so no complain there! But next time we want to try cod fish& chips, grilled calamari, and clam chowder. :)\n\nWe wish they have deep fried oysters too, I think it will be amazing!",

For dessert we tried their chocolate cake (they didn't have anymore carrot cake). It's understandable that some menu items wouldn't be available due to the freshness of the food so we didn't get a chance to try their crab cakes or clam chowder. I would highly recommend the fish and chips, the snapper was very light and battered perfectly. Overall I'm happy we visited and I would definitely go back if I visit BC again :)",
