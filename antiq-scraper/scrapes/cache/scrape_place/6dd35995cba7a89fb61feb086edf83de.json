The day I called Sweepy maids, they booked me through for the same day.\nTheir team cleaned every bit and piece of the household, it was a thorough deep cleaning in and out of my 2 bedroom apartment. Every appliance, the smallest of the knob or switches were cleaned with great care.\nThe team carried out the cleaning, as though it's their own home. I am so glad I booked Sweepy maids Vancouver.\nMy apartment is brand new now and a great thanks to this affectionate team. They made sure, I am well satisfied with their cleaning. They stayed a little extra and made sure everything was perfectly cleaned.\nThey made sure, not a single hair or dust particle remains on the walls or floor. My carpets were washed well twice to make sure all corners go nice and clean.\nProfessional service with great team. I  recommend this to all. They are my to go cleaning service of all times from now on.\nThank you so much Sweepy Maids!!!!",
