Employees are so busy making drink lid and straw to make a drum kit at the cashier and not helping me.  Then he forgot to serve my food and had it sit 5 min  until manager realized that I have been standing for a while.\n3. When I ate, my chicken wrap had minimal lettuce and also over cooked chicken.(see the pictures)\n\nManager had to keep telling employees what to do.\nShe needs to fire these lazy ones that she needs to tell what to do.\n\nDefinitely I am not coming back to this location.",

Employees are so busy making drink lid and straw to make a drum kit at the cashier and not helping me.  Then he forgot to serve my food and had it sit 5 min  until manager realized that I have been standing for a while.\n3. When I ate, my chicken wrap had minimal lettuce and also over cooked chicken.(see the pictures)\n\nManager had to keep telling employees what to do.\nShe needs to fire these lazy ones that she needs to tell what to do.\n\nDefinitely I am not coming back to this location.",

While the incident itself was not catastrophic, it did raise some serious concerns regarding food safety and customer care.\n\nDuring my visit, I ordered a McFlurry. As I was enjoying it, I suddenly choked on a sharp piece of plastic that had broken off from a McFlurry lid and found its way into the ice cream. This was not just a random occurrence; the manager admitted to witnessing the lid break while mixing the McFlurry and still choosing to serve it. All she did was put a new lid on the McFlurry. This, in my view, is 100% negligence on the part of the staff.\n\nUpon reporting the incident, I was met with an apology from a supervisor who explained that  the recent plastic ban had prompted the use of a new mixer system that broke the lid. I was refunded for my meal and offered a $25 compensation. Frankly, I did not feel that this was an adequate response given the admitted negligence and the potential harm that could have resulted.\n\nAfter some back-and-forth discussions with the owner, I expressed how much more serious the issue could have been and the potential financial damages that could have arisen if I had swallowed the plastic. In response to my concerns, the owner eventually offered an additional $75 in gift cards. While this was a more substantial gesture, it still leaves me with lingering apprehension.\n\nMy concern remains that this situation had the potential to be far more serious. Had a child or someone else accidentally ingested the plastic, it could have led to not only a lawsuit but also significant public outcry and injury. Thankfully, I did not swallow the plastic, and my injuries were limited to a minor cut on my tongue. Nevertheless, the entire incident has left me feeling rattled.\n\nIn conclusion, while McDonald's did take some steps to address the situation and increase the compensation, I believe that a more thorough investigation and a more substantial gesture of goodwill were warranted. Food safety should always be a top priority, and I hope that incidents like this can serve as a wake-up call for better training and procedures in the future.",
