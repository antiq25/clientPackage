Two other people in line were coming back because their phones still weren't working properly after being fixed.\nIt was a nightmare I felt rushed and not listened to. The music was blaring.They charged me $500 dollars. I got home and the phone didn't work. They had made a big deal about throwing in a free screen protector but it was brittle plastic and when I dropped my phone on a thin carpet it broke and so did the screen. I always use a gel screen protector so this was ridiculous. Cheap cheap cheap! They refused to fix it so altogether I think I paid $700 for a phone that stopped working in less than a year. If you don't know much about electronics all of this is a bit daunting. I was recovering from an injury and wasn't very mobile. I didn't have the energy to shop around.I didn't know who to trust or what my options were.Buyer beware don't shop here!",

It was a complete waste of time and resources because it was a lie. So they replaced the screen with a non original part and it began to overheat. My '15 minute repair' turned out to be almost 2 months and 5 trips back and forth to get my phone back. All to save $20. An authorized repair was $350 and these guys charged me $330.

            "review_id": "A summary of my experience with this store over 5 consecutive days. For accessibility reason with my disability, I rely on the phone vibration to let me know that there's notification or a phone call, and I use the phone to text daily with haptic feedbacks on the keyboard, and whatnot.\n\nDay 1:\nPhone was working fine, including vibration and haptics. I was using the phone up to the last minute to browse the internet a bit while waiting, and the haptics were still working that time. My Pixel 5's battery capacity was low, so I decided to get a battery replacement at the store. I took the phone to the shop on Fraser Street, and was charged $110 and the warranty claims to repair all issues stemming from their repair.\n\nI picked up the phone 5pm same day and I was told leave the screen alone after sealing. Later in the night when I think the screen glue's solid enough, I noticed the phone vibration wasn't working.\n\nDay 2:\n10am in the morning: I went back to the shop to fix the vibration because. The male employee who looked at the phone, checked the vibration setting, agreed that it isn't working, and said the phone can be ready for pick up around 5pm.\n2pm: I checked with the store to see if the repair's been done. I was told it's in progress.\n4pm: I was told was still being fixed, and it'd be fixed before the store closes at 8pm.\n730pm: Tried calling them several times between 6pm to 7pm, and I didn't get a phone call back from them, so I went to the store and found it already closed.\n\nDay 3:\nThere was no communication from them for the whole day despite calling them to ask and getting voice mail. When I went to the store, my phone still had its screen removed. I was also told that the senior technician would come in the morning the next day, that it'll be fixed by 3pm tomorrow.\n\nDay 4:\nI went to the store at 3pm. My phone's vibration didn't work when picked up, had the setting looked through by the front desk employee. She confirmed that there's no settings. However, she also refused to accept that the battery replacement caused the vibration issues. As of midnight, the phone still had no vibration.\n\nDay 5:\nI went in again, and the same female employee went through the vibration test app and all the settings, and so did the older guy with glasses. However, they were insistent that the battery replacement didn't cause the vibration.\n\nWhen I asked the lady how are they sure that they didn't cause the damage. She claimed that their technicians \"know everything\". After a while they had the technician to come and talk to me again. When I asked the technician himself what's the problem with the vibration motor, he said didn't know why and that maybe my phone's been like this before I came to them.\n\nThe technician claimed that they do not touch the vibration motor at all so it couldn't have been their fault. He wrote that they can't open the phone again because the screen might break, even though the Gorilla Glass screen can withstand 500C easily. He added that if I take responsibility for the screen they can do it for a \"little charge\" of $30. And stresses that phone screens are very expensive.\n\nIt sounded like an insinuation an accident would happen to my phone if I kept pushing for warranty repair. For him to do his job, he'd have to remove the screen from every phone to do his work. For someone who does his daily work around phones, he lacked confidence in himself, otherwise he wouldn't ask clients responsible for the cost of broken glass screen and charge the more for extra repairs. Therefore, by asking me to take responsibility for the cost of the screen in case he damages it, he's being honest about his lack of ability (or care) to fix my problem. And that they won't cover a screen broken due to their own repairs.\n\nAs such, it's best to take the technician's advice to heart and not go to Fix 4 U Cellular and that there are more professional, competent, ethical, and knowledgeable cell phone repair shops elsewhere.",
