The hicup was the delay of the new roof installation on the facility.  As a result Tarum had to work closely with the roofing contractor to make sure his installation met the warranty requirements.  I have to say that Vancouver Solar did an exceptional job of doing quality work despite the obstacles.  Tarum took care of all permits & dealing with BC Hydro to join its grid.  He made sure that the job was done right.  We are pleased with the finished product & would highly recommend Vancouver Solar.",

Our roof has many segments and some skylights, which added complexity, but the installation was done well and looks very clean. There are no visible wires on the roof although the system has 9 separate panel locations. Tarum the owner made the whole process easy including the permit application and the setup for net metering with hydro. He was happy to give me detailed explanations on the types of solar, we went with optimizers and an inverter, and answered many questions of mine. We're now 2 months in and the system is working really well. We've had no issues and the app is easy to use. I'm so happy to see our credits at BC Hydro building up this summer for when we need it in the winter.\nIn the end I cannot recommend Vancouver Solar enough. Great job guys!",

We contacted some other companies, but Tarum was the most professional in explaining our options and had competitive pricing.\nTarum took care of all the ordering, permits and schedules, and worked with our builder for the installation.  He also contacted BC-Hydro to setup the net-metering account. It was a hassle-free and smooth process.\n\nAs we were the first solar in our area, Tarum had to spend a day tutoring to the electrical inspectors how the solar system worked.\n\nWe now have 44 solar panels installed on our roofs along with a battery backup system and it has been working great.",
