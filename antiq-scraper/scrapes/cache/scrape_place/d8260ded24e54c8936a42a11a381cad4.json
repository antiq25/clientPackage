A picture of the Fisherman who caught your seafood is on the package so you know exactly where it came from and can say a little thanks before eating. Fresh items is a Thursday evening pickup at Fishermans wharf- think spot prawns, mussels or live crab. Great business that I will continue to support.",

It's easy to do pick-ups at Fisherman's Wharf and at community partners (e.g., Choices).  We believe in the way they do business: supporting local fishing families who catch seafood using sustainable methods.  Every time we've chatted with Skipper Otto staff, we've come away enriched by the conversation and full of admiration for their commitment to our oceans.",
