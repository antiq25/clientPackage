I can walk, bike, and drive again, and my cognition and screen time tolerance is improving with the exercises. None of this was the case when I first started with Krishna.\n\nDuring my first session, Krishna quickly identified that my vision was affected by the concussion and that is the likely cause of my symptoms.

I should've gone to my doc for a shot(which I found out later), but a week later, I went to MJ physio. She used ultrasound & tens machine to help heal. She told me about certain exercises that I should do to strengthen & stretching my glutes & hamstrings, as I wasn't in good shape to play golf. Doc said it'd take 6-12 weeks, but I played my first golf 5 weeks after injury and I played better because I was more stronger in my core and glutes. I'm still getting treatments b'c of sore left shoulder & back and she's used shock therapy for shoulder and it has rapidly helped the shoulder. My back pain is also getting better. 6 weeks later now, I'm playing golf better & I can run if I have to, btw, I'm a newish senior. I'm planning to check in with Krishna from time to time if I feel aches & pains. Thanks much, Krishna!",

            "review_text": "Krishna treated my left hip bursitis and knee injury from golf, on 1st day of season. My pain was so bad I couldn't walk & completely bent over the next day and on. I should've gone to my doc for a shot(which I found out later), but a week later, I went to MJ physio. She used ultrasound & tens machine to help heal. She told me about certain exercises that I should do to strengthen & stretching my glutes & hamstrings, as I wasn't in good shape to play golf. Doc said it'd take 6-12 weeks, but I played my first golf 5 weeks after injury and I played better because I was more stronger in my core and glutes. I'm still getting treatments b'c of sore left shoulder & back and she's used shock therapy for shoulder and it has rapidly helped the shoulder. My back pain is also getting better. 6 weeks later now, I'm playing golf better & I can run if I have to, btw, I'm a newish senior. I'm planning to check in with Krishna from time to time if I feel aches & pains. Thanks much, Krishna!",
