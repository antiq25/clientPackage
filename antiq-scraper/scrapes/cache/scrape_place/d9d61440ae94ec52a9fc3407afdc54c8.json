The restaurant's staff said they usually don't do takeout, but she offered to inquire for me. Shortly after, a person who appeared to be the manager came out with a smile and asked me, \"What would you like to order?\" I ordered two appetizers, Signature Wok Squid and Fried Oysters. He also suggested that I could get a portion of steamed rice or fried rice to go along with them.I sat on a chair by the harbor and started tasting a few bites. Both the squid and oyster were very fresh, and the squid had a great flavor. Paired with white rice, it was just right. The dipping sauce for the fried oyster had a hint of orange sweetness, and it was delicious. I definitely need to go back to the restaurant, sit on that beautiful patio, and enjoy another seafood meal.",
