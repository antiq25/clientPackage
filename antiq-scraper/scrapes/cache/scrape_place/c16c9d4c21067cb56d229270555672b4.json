The cleaning ladies are very polite and courteous but thats about all I have to say good about this dive! Oh and it is far too expensive for whst you get there. Better off with an air b&b or a tent",

It stayed like that for the duration of my stay about 1 month, on top of that charged me 200 for a small thin piece of single pain glass and didn't even bother to fix it. Abdoloutly horrific place to stay. My laundry was taken out of the dryer and given to another room by the front desk lady. The cleaning ladies are very polite and courteous but thats about all I have to say good about this dive! Oh and it is far too expensive for whst you get there. Better off with an air b&b or a tent",
