I was immediately captivated by the sheer variety of plants available - from lush greens to vibrant reds, they had a wide selection that were visually stunning. The knowledge and guidance provided by the staff made it easy to select the perfect plants for my aquarium.\n\nOne of the most delightful discoveries during my visit was the adorable cherry shrimp. These little creatures added an unexpected charm to the store. The staff's expertise in caring for these small invertebrates was evident, and their health and vivacity were a testament to the store's commitment to quality and care for all its inhabitants.\n\nThe store itself is a treasure trove for any aquatic enthusiast. Beyond the vibrant flora and charming shrimp, Aquariums West boasts an impressive array of supplies and fish species. The attention to detail in maintaining the tanks and the quality of the aquatic life on offer truly sets this place apart.\n\nWhether you're a seasoned aquarist or a newcomer to the hobby, Aquariums West is an absolute must-visit. The diversity, quality, and expert guidance make it a top destination for all things aquatic. I left not just with new additions for my tank but also with a wealth of knowledge. Kudos to Aquariums West for providing such a wonderful experience.",

Except our actual tank which was from the 80s.\n\nJust a heads up side note;\n\nIt can be a little uptight with the on-going covid restrictions and how you enter and leave the store can be a bit uncomfortable and off-putting.\n\nYou have to leave your backpack behind the counter and wait behind a rope before being allowed entry.\nThis is understandable in our city of Vancouver where shoplifting & addiction is rampant unfortunately. This store is way too nice to let any scumbags in. I get it.",
