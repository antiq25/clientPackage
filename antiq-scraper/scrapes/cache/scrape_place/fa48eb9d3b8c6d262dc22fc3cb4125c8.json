Infested. Dead weevils. Not only that, but somewhere along the line, someone had actually taped up the packet from being opened (don't even ask me who would've done this...I have no idea. Factory worker? Someone in the store and then they just sealed the cereal box back up?).\n\nI don't find weevils to be that gross, I was more concerned at the disgusting fact that someone had the audacity to seal up an opened packet of Weetabix and think placing it back in the box to seal and sell would be a good idea.\n\nAnyways, this sorta thing leaves a bad taste in your mouth. We live in the River District and don't mind coming here for a few \"here and there\" items, but Jesus Christ. A Monday morning shouldn't entail in you having to pull everything out of your cupboards to kill weevils when you have to start work right after dropping your kid off at daycare.\n\nSo we went back Monday afternoon and got a refund - I should've pushed them in refunding us our entire grocery bill from the previous day. But my wife didn't want me to get too harsh with them. I understand that it's possibly not THEIR fault... but some dolt along the line felt it was okay to tape back up an opened individual packet in a cereal box. And when I say the packet was infested...it was infested. Dead weevils. Dried up dead weevil corpses that reminded me of Egyptian mummies.\n\nAnd that's not all folks, we have spent the last 2+ days just finding one here and one there. Vinegar spray and soapy water has helped (vinegar I'm thinking is the better choice) and bay leaves/garlic cloves (though they are just a deterrent and not a permanent solution).\n\nIn the end, I should've just asked for a complete bill refund (not just on the cereal) and asked for them to pitch in a packet of bay leaves, some garlic, sani wipes/spray and a bottle of vinegar. Because I tell ya, it's a long process in clearing out every shelf/cupboard when this happens...especially when you have work to do, dinner to cook, and a baby to care for.\n\nWhat an absolute joke of a store.\n\nI would say at this point, we've probably killed around 50 live weevils in our kitchen area. Those suckers get in anything containing paper/cardboard so check all of our paper products surrounding the area.",

The prices are a bit more expensive than superstore, but the selection of goods is decent for the size of the store.\n\nThe pharmacy is what deserves this 2 star rating...maybe worse. It's really terrible. I had to pick up medication for my 2.5 year old last year and my GP called the pharmacy several times and no one picked up (the site clearly indicated the pharmacy was still open for another hour). We had to call into a different pharmacy to have the prescription filled. Then we dropped off a medication for her several months later (because this location is convenient for us). At time of pickup the next day we discovered they hadn't even mixed the medication for her so we had to wait. Then they gave us a syringe so we could give her the proper dosage, but the syringe didn't fit the bottle of medication! A month ago we needed an ointment for my daughter so I asked my husband to go to a different pharmacy to have it compounded. He forgot and dropped it off here again for convenience. And AGAIN it was not ready for pickup and we had to wait for them to compound it (2 days after they said it would be ready!). In fact I'm not convinced the medication was properly mixed into the ointment because the consistency is uneven. It's really the worst pharmacy experience I've ever had. I guess at least we eventually get the correct medication, but I would strongly recommend going to a different pharmacy whenever possible.",

It's essential to be vigilant without making patrons feel accused or uncomfortable.\n\nWhat made matters worse was that my daughter was with me during the incident with the cashier.
