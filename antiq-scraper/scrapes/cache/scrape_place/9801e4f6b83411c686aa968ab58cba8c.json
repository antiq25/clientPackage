It was pretty empty so I don't think there's a need for reservations unless you want to reserve a particular dish like we did.\n\nThe highlight of the night was definitely the pigeon, the melon soup and the sweet and sour pork.\n\nThe pigeon was really crispy and juicy at the same time. Perfectly salted and delicious (no Pic as it was grabbed at quickly)\n\nThe melon soup was so full of goods that I don't think it should be called a soup and instead it should be considered a meal. There was craband scallops inside. The soup was so sweet not in a fake sugary kind of way but a savory and seafood kind of way. Would recommend if money is of no object\n\nThe sweet and sour pork was surprisingly good. Crispy on the outside. Perfect balance of sweet and salty. The meat wasn't dry but instead very crisp in a good way.\n\nOverall the food here was pretty good. Not overly salty and didn't make me drink loads of water afterwards. The service was friendly and fast. My dirty plates were switched out every time a shell landed on it. The prices are appropriate for the amount of food and quality of food. Would definitely recommend the pigeon and sweet and sour pork. The atmosphere was nice because only half the restaurant was full. People were well spaced out and lots of wait staff to help.",
