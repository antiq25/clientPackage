So I asked them how long does it take, and then they said they can't make it what I ordered.\nAt that time I had only 2 min to take the ferry.\nThey offered 2 small wraps instead of a big wrap. But they didnt make it in 2 min, I asked for the refund right away. But the manager was soooo slow, didnt try to help me, repeating excuses and so rude!!!!\nEventually, I missed the ferry and had to waste 30 min:) thank you guys!",

Waited another 5 mins before inquiry and was asked to wait more.  Then inquired after sometime again still asked to wait. Finally people who ordered before me and after me every got their orders. Inquired third time and managers went to check. After waiting we more time they brought my order of Burger without labels on Burgers which were different and melted ice cream. Asked to change the ice cream then left the location. When sat down to eat in the near park realized the burgers were without Mayo as asked but no Habenaro. What I waste of my time and money. Very disappointed with service and food.",
