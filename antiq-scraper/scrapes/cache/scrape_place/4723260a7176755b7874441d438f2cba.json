She was so patient with me and gave me awesome drink recommendations.  I ended up with a cider and did try the IPA's. The soup and salad were fresh and delicious.  I believe it was a chicken curry soup. I then ordered the Poutine with bacon and mushrooms. Very tasty! I loved how the place was right across the Gastown steam clock. So I was able to hear the steam go off while enjoying my meal and the view. If I ever come back to Vancouver, I will go out of my way to eat here again!",

She was so patient with me and gave me awesome drink recommendations.  I ended up with a cider and did try the IPA's. The soup and salad were fresh and delicious.  I believe it was a chicken curry soup. I then ordered the Poutine with bacon and mushrooms. Very tasty! I loved how the place was right across the Gastown steam clock. So I was able to hear the steam go off while enjoying my meal and the view. If I ever come back to Vancouver, I will go out of my way to eat here again!",

After taking some of the usual tourist photos & waiting for the steam to blow the whistle, we found our way to the Black Frog Eatery. Settling in at 1 pm we were warmly welcomed and quickly seated. From our table we had an excellent view of the Steam Clock. I watched tourists posing with the clock as we awaited our order.\n\nWe weren't very hungry and decided to share a club sandwich.  I'm happy to say that it was made with real meat--none of that sliced processed poultry!  The fries were good too, and I washed it all down with a local award-winning Kokanee lager.\n\nThe ambiance of the Black Frog is definitely that of a pub-style eatery and the decor accentuates that feel.  That's a good thing, and to me, very comforting. Lot's of wood, brick, and pub-style elements all around. This is absolutely the type of place I'd have lunch at if I'd worked in the area.  Their menu has a good selection to satisfy everyone's tastes. Prices are on par with other restaurants offering similar fare.  The type of place that I call \"no nonsense and basic good eating\". Service was prompt, efficient, and the staff knew their menu well. When we find our way back to Vancouver, I will certainly plan on coming back.",
