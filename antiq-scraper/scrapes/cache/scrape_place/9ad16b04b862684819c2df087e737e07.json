We apologize that we confused you with local fish as 'Asian mystery' fish which were not familiar with you. But majority of our fish are caught in local Norther BC while Seabass and Sockeye Salmon are now imported and King Salmon is raised in BC. Of course situation will change but we're happy to answer your question anytime for your comport. Hope we can serve you again.",
