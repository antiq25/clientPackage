Of course there are individuals, I know someone who got ripped off by an individual in this Burger King. There are also regular working people, office people, young people, and tourists. Usually they always have posters up for items that sold out long ago. They have a really large menu with a lot of customizability. I always found the staff to be nice and patient with me, even though I have yet to memorize the Burger King menu, and always need to read it when I get to the front. When you're standing at the front waiting for your food, it feels really tense, like a contest, because some things take forever, and you could get your food way earlier or way later than you expect.\n\nNot just anybody can use the bathrooms, they would be too prone to abuse in a location like this, the bathrooms are for paying customers only. No shenanigans.\n\nI like the music they play in here, it's always pleasant. Generally '70s music with a leaning towards soul.\n\nThe Angry Whopper is dope, I like that, I get it with no cheese because I'm lactose intolerant. I want to try and see if they have any spicy chicken tenders or nuggets.\n\nThis is a lively and fun establishment.\n\nTo be honest, I like to go to Jollibee first and order a two piece chicken, eat that, and then smuggle the Jollibee gravy in my pocket and use it for the Burger King fries. I haven't gotten banned yet.\n\nI usually go during off hours in the afternoons, and there are a lot of individuals. Right now I'm here at lunch and it is very orderly and normal. Kind of disappointing, really.",

No shenanigans.\n\nI like the music they play in here, it's always pleasant. Generally '70s music with a leaning towards soul.\n\nThe Angry Whopper is dope, I like that, I get it with no cheese because I'm lactose intolerant. I want to try and see if they have any spicy chicken tenders or nuggets.\n\nThis is a lively and fun establishment.\n\nTo be honest, I like to go to Jollibee first and order a two piece chicken, eat that, and then smuggle the Jollibee gravy in my pocket and use it for the Burger King fries. I haven't gotten banned yet.\n\nI usually go during off hours in the afternoons, and there are a lot of individuals. Right now I'm here at lunch and it is very orderly and normal. Kind of disappointing, really.",

Everyone was working hard even the cashier looked drained. orders were coming out quickly, staff were friendly and helpful and someone was out in the dining room keeping things clean (I really appreciated that). Of course my order took longer then most because I had to get something that took time to do but no complaints from me. I was impressed because the last time I was there was a long time ago and its was a disaster,  like no one cared. I hope this crew keeps up the great work, it's alot of hard work and not an easy job.",
