Where we were sat was a very small table for 4 but we were 5 people then they ended up switching us to bigger table afterwards. Inside is extreme dark, and patio was brighter and more airy. You can choose which atmosphere you like to be in.\n\nWe ordered salmon appy, beef&lamb kebabs, lingcod/lamb/goat/chicken/beef/veg curry with many drinks.\n\nAll the food was Luke warm. Nothing was hot. Maybe we misheard but they said it comes with rice and nann with 5 curry dishes we ordered and we got 4 pieces of nann and one bowl of rice.  I think we ordered 5 extra after.\n\nWe got the Indian donut they called it, that was warm and present. Not too sweet and one bite size. Mango kulfi was mangoy and creamy. Coconut rice pudding was a good portion and delicious.\n\nOverall service was good but the food came out really late and Luke warm to cold which wasn't nice.\n\nNot sure if I would be back but we still had a good time.",

Also, we shall make sure that the food does not take long for your table.\nthanks\nVikram Vij ",

The service was shockingly slow and busy, and a lot of customers were visibly angry, but I'll give an extra two stars for Mr. Vij (the owner and celebrity chef, who works there)'s energetic personality and his love for food. The atmosphere is fantastic and I personally loved the presentation. As for the food, we took lamb chops and Bengali chicken curry. I personally loved the lamb chops(their speciality), which were really flavorful and smoky. As for the Bengali curry, it was overall bland for me, but children may like it more, as Mr. Vij says. Overall the food just needs a bit more for five stars, but this restaurant is a great experience.",
