I would say this is the brewery with the best ambience in Mt Pleasant.\nWARNING: They do NOT do growler fills. If you google \"33 acres growler fills\" the first result will tell you that they are doing growler fills, but it is not true (as of August 2023). On the FAQ of their website, they mention that they are currently not doing growler fills. Hopefully they consider doing them again - literally every other brewery in the area does.",

However 20 bucks for a pack of 4  is simply a bloody rip off. Seriously ?? $5.00 for a can of beer? In the government liquor store similar if not the same taste for a Czech  or German  beer you pay 2.25 at the most. I tried it , it is fine ,but for the price they charge , never again. I guess that place is for people with deeper pockets ,not for me. Fix your prices or you will start loosing customers.",

Unfortunately they stopped serving coffee at 4 so we missed out there, but the ginger beer I had was delicious and folks enjoyed their beers.\n\nMy biggest complaint was the popcorn I ordered for $5 that was clearly made several hours before and pulled off an open-air shelf by an employee when I ordered it. It was, as you'd expect, stale, and I'm a little puzzled admittedly as to why popcorn couldn't be made (or even kept?) fresh daily. I had a pretzel that had some interesting sides and was okay, though admittedly a little misshapen.\n\nOkay stop for a pricey locally brewed drink, but I think the rest went over my head.",
