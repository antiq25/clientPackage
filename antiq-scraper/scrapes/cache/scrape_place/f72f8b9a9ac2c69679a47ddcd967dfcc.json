And the salad leaf was soggy.\nAs a result I didn't even finish my burger.\n\nThe fries were extremely salty and I had to shake off the salt.\nThat's probably the idea of this bar on how to make customers order more drinks.\n\nIt's definitely not a place to eat. The food may be ok if you come for a couple drinks.",
