Food came out very quick so kudos to the back of the house for keeping things moving during happy hour!\n\nWe got lobster rolls, truffle fries, fish tacos, and 2 of each regular oyster and premium oyster.\nFor drinks we ordered their red sangria (rotating basis presumably between red and white wines) and a non-alcoholic local hazy IPA. We aren't big drinkers so won't go into detail, nevertheless they were both refreshing and tasty drinks that paired well with our food choices.\n\nThe lobster roll was great, you can taste the freshness of the lobster meat itself. This was something we did not find in the lobsters we've personally had around Toronto. The dressing and small cuts of veggies did well to complement and complete the lobster roll.\n\nTruffle fries were well seasoned, being able to get hints of truffle (presumably from truffle oil) every other bite or so. The aioli paired well with the fries as well.\n\nFish tacos were fresh, the flavor and texture of the coleslaw went well to balance out the grease of a fried fish fillet. I probably could have gone for another order but didn't want to risk a permanent food coma.\n\nOne set of oysters tasted more of the ocean than the other. Going by what the wait staff pointed out as the regular vs premium, the latter had the more ocean-y briney taste. Not for everyone especially if you aren't a fan of seafood, but if you dabble then these are definitely worth a try at a reasonable price.\n\nAll in all, we were thoroughly impressed with all aspects of our visit. It is on our very short list of places we'd definitely revisit on our next stop in Vancouver!",

Great vibin atmosphere. We were seated exactly at our reservation time. Our server was nice, quick, and knowledgeable on the menu. She mentioned the uni was firm and that made me go for it (I've had some bad experiences with this delicacy). It was delicious.\n\nOrdered many different dishes - Sun Seeker, Sweet Select, and Kumamoto oysters were all delicious and fresh. One of them were very meaty. The horseradish is freshly grated. Lobster poutine was packed with lobster but pretty meh overall. Crab cake was a bit dry. 6pc scallop was seared to perfection. The tuna tartare was a bit salty, but still tasted good. The octopus was amazing and tender. And of course as mentioned earlier, the uni was the best and most fresh I've ever had.\n\nThe wife says they make an amazing espresso martini. Definitely get a reservation as this spot was packed on a Monday night. They have fresh oysters that you can take home if you like to shuck (who doesn't like to shuck)? When I visit Vancouver again, I will definitely be stopping by.",

Definitely a 5 star!\n\nLet's break down this joint. Great vibin atmosphere. We were seated exactly at our reservation time. Our server was nice, quick, and knowledgeable on the menu. She mentioned the uni was firm and that made me go for it (I've had some bad experiences with this delicacy). It was delicious.\n\nOrdered many different dishes - Sun Seeker, Sweet Select, and Kumamoto oysters were all delicious and fresh. One of them were very meaty. The horseradish is freshly grated.
