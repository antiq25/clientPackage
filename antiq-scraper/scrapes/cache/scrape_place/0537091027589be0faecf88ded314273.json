I've been coming here for a few years now for my seafood, and could never go anywhere else - it is always super fresh, and super delicious. Their organic spring salmon is some of the best I've ever had (highly recommend), and their smoked salmon selection is fantastic. I always go for the peppered nuggets (super moist and flavourful), the double smoked, and the cold smoked spring - they're the only people I've seen who cold smoke spring salmon! The service is always wonderful and they often go above and beyond. It's a bit pricey, however it's expected for the quality and location. I have and will continue recommending this place!",

I only ordered a few pieces of smoked salmon since I didn't have anywhere to store the food, but I wish I did because this fish is super well done! The maple glazed salmon nuggets are the best.\n\nThe staff here was also really helpful in providing us recommendations and answering questions so kudos to the team.",

The fish had a very fishy smell to it. That indicates to me it's not too fresh. I've had salmon from other grocers to compare & no other places had fishy smell to my salmon. Very fresh & high quality fish is supposed to be scent less & not fishy. I wonder if it's because not too many people were buying the spring salmon fillets & they were there for a while. I'm kind of disappointed in this place seeing it is supposedly a high end seafood store in a high end location. I doubt I'll be back to do business again.",
