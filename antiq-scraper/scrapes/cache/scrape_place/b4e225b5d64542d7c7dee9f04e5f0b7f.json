Just like before they're an amazing team and extremely great at what they do.\n\nWhile there was a bit of miscommunication that led to a bit of delay on the installation (set-up logistics mishap from not seeing the layout of my condo prior to the install team coming in), overall experience on everything else was superb. The reps on the phone were very nice and helpful. The install team that showed up were very professional, nice, and worked very hard to problem-solve the logistics issue while ensuring all strata codes are followed and I was fully satisfied with their proposed solutions (trust me, you don't want to fall out of compliance from Strata rules).\n\nWould highly recommend their services to anyone.",

Ashton pricing is definitely pricey, but Shawn was a true professional and is able to find fix my problem quickly. He explained everything he was doing and involved me in his findings. He took the time to diagnose the issue properly unlike other technicians I've had before who diagnosed wrong. He kept the workplace tidy and clean. He also offered a service membership which I signed up for considering it gave a 15% service discount immediately. Shawn is the guy you want to call if you have hvac issues, 10/10 service and expertise.",

On the day of the appointment, they called 11 am to reschedule for the following week (same time slot) because a technician was sick.\n\nFor the second appointment, I waited for an hour and no one called or showed up.  When I called their office, the representative (Carlos) said that he would check and someone would call me back.  An hour and a half later, no one called.  When I called again, another representative (Stephanie) told me they could not make it that day.  After I told her to cancel my appointment, she offered $100 credit and reschedule me for two days later.  I rejected the offer saying that the credit is of no use to me if no body shows up for the service call as agreed.  She assured me that she would personally notify me about the new appointment.\n\nOn the day of the THIRD appointment, I traveled to my parent's place again and waited an hour.  No call arrived from Ashton!  When I called them, the representative (Carlos) told me he would check and call me back.  And no one did!  When I called the office again, another representative (Erin) told me that I got the time wrong and the appointment should have been the next day.  I told her to check with Stephanie, who offered me the credit and new appointment.  Erin kept saying that I got the time wrong.  At that point, I told her to cancel my appointment and I will take my business elsewhere.  She simply said OK.\n\nFunny enough, about half an hour later, Erin (I think) called me back and apologized that the technician could not make it and offered to reschedule it for the next day.  I told her that altogether I wasted more than 10 hours waiting for service and they need to change their business practice.  And I told her I will take my business elsewhere for a second time.\n\nIf you need reliable service, find another shop!",
