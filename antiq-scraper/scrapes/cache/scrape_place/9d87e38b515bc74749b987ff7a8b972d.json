They have 5-6 dishes in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian recipes and you can get try pretty much all of them with different combinations which I think is the best way to explore their entire menu!!  The food is a fusion of Indian and Mediterranean cuisine and plated in a Nutritious way which is cherry on top! \n\nThis place has a great ambiance and located is at a great location; convenient for people taking public transportation as well as driving. Street parking is available on Main Street and on side streets.\n\nThey have a very friendly and welcoming staff which I feel elevates the whole experience!!\n\nDefinitely, going back again!! ",

First impressions, the architecture and decor is superb and a delight for the visual senses. Despite being a busy Saturday evening, we were greeted promptly and courteously by the front desk. The hospitality was fantastic- we were offered a delicious tea and boulani while waiting for our table. We were seated close to the \"stage\". The table was quite small for our group of 4. And although the chairs were beautifully handcrafted, they were not comfortable. We each selected the feast. At $43 pp, it was a great way to taste the menu. I would suggest having a similar tasting option for children at a reduced rate. Our favourite items were the joojeh chicken kebab, lamb curry, Tibetan mantu, and the peas with cheese. Service was prompt for the most part although the chicken kebabs did take a while longer. The servers were friendly and courteous nonetheless. The violin music in the background was a nice touch. Overall highly recommend you visit this beautiful restaurant and delight your senses! Thanks for the bday gesture of song and gulab jamun :)",
