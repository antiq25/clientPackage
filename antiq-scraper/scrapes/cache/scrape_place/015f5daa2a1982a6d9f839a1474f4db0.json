Every employee there is really knowledgeable about aquarium care. Although I wasn't there to buy fish, the principles are all pretty much the same for my turtle, and I was able to get all the necessary decorations, chemicals, and materials to make the perfect home for my turtle.\n\nI also ordered my aquarium stand from them at a great price compared to other stores, and they hand-delivered it to me within the week! I felt particularly grateful for that, because I did not have the strength to carry that item myself, and I was already a bit stressed about that. They took the worry right out of my hands. Not to mention...it was free!\n\nI also had one of the employees teach me about improving the flora in my aquarium, and advised me on some good decorations that would not just be pretty, but support the health of the tank. Since I've done the recommendations, my tank is healthier than it has ever been, and it requires less maintenance compared to before. Every time I go into the store I learn a bunch of new things!\n\nI always enjoy going to April's Aquarium. Not just because it's fun to look at the fishes and browse the goods, but because the service is truly top notch. I highly recommend it for all your aquarium needs! Thank you!",

            "review_text": "This is an incredible aquarium store, highly recommend!\n\nOver the last few months I've been building a 55 gallon aquarium for my 21-year old Red Eared Slider. Every employee there is really knowledgeable about aquarium care. Although I wasn't there to buy fish, the principles are all pretty much the same for my turtle, and I was able to get all the necessary decorations, chemicals, and materials to make the perfect home for my turtle.\n\nI also ordered my aquarium stand from them at a great price compared to other stores, and they hand-delivered it to me within the week! I felt particularly grateful for that, because I did not have the strength to carry that item myself, and I was already a bit stressed about that. They took the worry right out of my hands. Not to mention...it was free!\n\nI also had one of the employees teach me about improving the flora in my aquarium, and advised me on some good decorations that would not just be pretty, but support the health of the tank. Since I've done the recommendations, my tank is healthier than it has ever been, and it requires less maintenance compared to before. Every time I go into the store I learn a bunch of new things!\n\nI always enjoy going to April's Aquarium. Not just because it's fun to look at the fishes and browse the goods, but because the service is truly top notch. I highly recommend it for all your aquarium needs! Thank you!",

Huge bins of hardscape will keep you there for hours if you're not careful. Highly recommend them. This shipment I got a bunch of these cuties. Love them!",
