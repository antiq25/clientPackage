The podiatrist seemed very unsure of herself, which was a bit unsettling, but I decided to have the procedure done anyway because I just wanted it done and it's relatively simple. The room was very small and cramped, I'm not sure if the podiatrist has their own office. Because the office was small, the equipment seemed a bit disorganized. The procedure seemed to be done okay, the incisions seemed straight and I think the phenol was applied, but the ingrown toenail has returned. Everything about the experience was mediocre, and now I have to get the procedure done again anyway somewhere else.",
