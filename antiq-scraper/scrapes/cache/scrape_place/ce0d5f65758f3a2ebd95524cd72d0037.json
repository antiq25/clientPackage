The cultured cashew base is tangy and smooth, and all their flavour combinations are well balanced. I particularly like the jalapeno and truffle varieties. Their cilantro dip is awesome too. Spread 'Em's chef is always coming up with new offerings like olive oil and herb marinated vegan soft cheeses and a Philly-style \"cream cheeze\" that quickly became my new favourite (it is divine on sourdough toast with sliced tomato and cucumber). Highest recommendation.",

We found it once and smashed through it in 24 hours, it's so damn good, and haven't found it again since! So this is more of a complaint to all the stores out there not getting their s*** together to stock this stuff, because they need to get on that!",
