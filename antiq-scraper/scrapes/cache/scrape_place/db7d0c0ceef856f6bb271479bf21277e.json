Everything was very flavourful and well presented, the was perfectly cooked (previously I'd been served Sable fish that was raw in the middle).\n\nWhat wasn't great was the service, yes it was a busy night and our server was trying to be present but it seemed obvious he was rushed when he did check in, combined with a long pause between appys and dinner, then another long pause before we were asked about desert then our coffees didn't come till after we were done with desert. Although the bill managed to show up well before we were done. At this point the restaurant was not busy.\n\nLastly our server managed to cut himself and put out plates for appys with blood smears on them and didn't.notice till I asked another server who very quickly swept them up. Appys arrived without replacement plates until it was pointed out. Not a good performance for premiere dining....",

            "review_text": "Came with a group of 7 on a chilly night for a special dinner. It was a busy Friday night. First the good, the food was better than I remembered it being. Everything was very flavourful and well presented, the was perfectly cooked (previously I'd been served Sable fish that was raw in the middle).\n\nWhat wasn't great was the service, yes it was a busy night and our server was trying to be present but it seemed obvious he was rushed when he did check in, combined with a long pause between appys and dinner, then another long pause before we were asked about desert then our coffees didn't come till after we were done with desert. Although the bill managed to show up well before we were done. At this point the restaurant was not busy.\n\nLastly our server managed to cut himself and put out plates for appys with blood smears on them and didn't.notice till I asked another server who very quickly swept them up. Appys arrived without replacement plates until it was pointed out. Not a good performance for premiere dining....",

My friends and I had the pleasure of dining with Tara and her colleagues and this was by far my best dining experience in the city (and I'm a local)!\n\nTara was knowledgeable, attentive and just a pleasure to be around. From the moment we arrived we were warmly greeted and never once did we have to try and seek her attention as she was always checking in. Any time someone left the table, her and her team were quick ensure settings and napkins remained tidy and presentable upon our arrival back. Tara explained the menu in detail and was quick to recommend food and beverage pairings that we were all pleased with. The food was beautifully presented, tasted great and everyone was satisfied.\n\nWhile I don't have photos of everything we ordered, the raw oysters were fresh and sweet, prawns were plump and juicy, and sashimi was fresh and paired with an in house soy sauce. I ordered the beef tenderloin and asked for it to be cooked between medium rare and rare and it was cooked to perfection. It was tender, seared crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. I also ordered the truffle fries as a side and will say you have to try them!\n\nTara is a gem and I want to thank her and the staff for creating such a welcoming atmosphere that was paired with amazing food! I don't know how it took me so long to come here but can definitely say I will be back.\n\nMake your reservation now and thank me later!",

The place was very accommodating about letting us move our reservation up a bit from when we originally set it. The place is very beautiful, well decorated and very elegant yet cozy. We sat on the enclosed patio and the temperature was perfect, not to mention the ivy covered lanterns giving soft romantic light to the room. We were given a hand written congratulations from the restaurant, which was a very sweet personal touch. Our server, Phillip, was engaging, charming, and was very well versed on the menu. Any question he couldn't answer he was quick to ask the kitchen. He also checked in with us all night and was constantly refilling our waters. It was a very royal treatment we did not expect at that price point, for certain. We got the two tier seafood platter, the scallops entre, and a beef tenderloin to split. Not only were they very attentive to my dairy allergy, and my wife's peanut allergy, but everything we tried exceeded our expectations. Never had jellyfish before here and I would for certain try it again. The oysters were fresh and absolutely something I was excited for as an oyster lover, I was not disappointed. In terms of accessibility I'd say very for a wheelchair, but I was having a good day so walked in with my cane. The parking is subject to downtown and I didn't see a disabled spot, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. Likely just filled before we got there. However they do offer valet services. They are very accommodating if you call ahead. Definitely recommend this place to seafood lovers looking for a nice elegant date spot.",
