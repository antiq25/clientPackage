It was quite busy at the show with many woman in front of me at their booth looking at their lovely things they had to showcase and sell. It included their stuffed animals (warm buddies) , cozy robes and other warming bottles. Everyone was touching and feeling and when it was my turn I asked the woman how much the teddy bears were. She replied in a very rude tone \"they're all a different price\". Ok well how much is this one I asked, I would like to buy it for my daughter. $20 dollars! She said rudely and so I handed it to my daughter and went to get my wallet when she said \"give me that one back or pay for it first if you want to see anything else, nobody wants to buy one that a child has touched\". I was so shocked! So shocked. And so were the other women (whom I didn't know). They all put the items down that they were looking at it. And one woman said that's the rudest thing someone could've said. Especially a salesperson trying to sell their product! A child's product ! I was not only embarrassed and mortified about the situation, but my daughter was so upset when I told her I'm sorry we aren't going to buy this anymore. 15 minutes later when I was walking around a woman from a different booth approached me and said she was so sorry for what that woman said to me and my daughter. It was so extremely rude and unprofessional. They really should not have this woman representing their company. ( she was wearing a lime green long sleeve underneath her black vest with short hair)  Hopefully the owner reads this and addresses this issue so it never happens again to anyone else. I can't imagine anyone wanting to support a company like this. I know I can't.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank Karen for replying to me. I do accept your apology and I can understand that it was quite busy and probably would've added to your probably stressful day. I was just really wanting to buy a warm buddy for my daughter. Thank you so very much for your offer of sending her a warm buddy, she will be so happy about this.",

I was attempting to find a Warm Buddy for your daughter as you said you were not sure which one she would like. That is what I understood.\nI was in the process of bringing choices for your daughter to see.\nWhat was going on at the same time was a customer wanting a Warm Buddy that had not been handled. Normally I would have allowed your daughter to keep the labrador she had while I brought more options.\nI wanted to explain what happened as I did realize that you were not happy.\nThis show can get very busy and I am sorry that you left without our resolving the situation.\nI am the owner of the company who you referred to and this situation is not what my company is about.  It is always my intention to have happy customers and for everybody to have access to our products.\nI would be very happy to send your daughter a Warm Buddy as that is what my intention was at the time.\n\nWarm Buddy options can be seen on our website.\nKindly accept my apology as there seems to have been a misunderstanding which caused stress for you.\nPlease contact us at info@warmbuddy.com with a product choice and shipping address, I will be very happy to send you a Warm Buddy for your daughter.\nAgain, please accept my sincere apologies for the unfortunate experience.\nWarmest regards,\nKaren",
