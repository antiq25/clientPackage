Airplane bathrooms are bigger than theirs, nit to mention that they are dirty. Disgusting! I wonder how clean their kitchens are? Cleanliness is not their priority.",

I pushed and said that it was wrong to take it, but he insisted it was no worries. i hope the rest of his shift and night went well, and that I truly appreciated it! :)",

I got my regular order which is a two breakfast burrito meal with coffee, a sausage McMuffin, and I decided to add a smoothie.  I got my order, opened the bag and right away there was no smoothie.  I take out the food and proceed to open up my burritos to add salsa inside.  Right away I noticed that the wrap seems soggy, I open it and the eggs and meat inside look wet.  I take a bite and it tastes fine.  Then I take my first sip of coffee and that tastes off.  I'm hungry so I eat my food.....  Then in around a half hour I start to feel light headed and sick to my stomach.  Then 15-20 minutes later I find myself puking and sitting on the toilet for a while.  It's now 8 hours later and my stomach has still been a mess.  No idea what happened, I've had this same breakfast so many times and it's never done this to me, so I guess I'm posting this to say if it looks or tastes off don't eat the food.",
