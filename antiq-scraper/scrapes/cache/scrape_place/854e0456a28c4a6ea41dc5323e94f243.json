Some dishes were a bit oily.\n\nMy favourite was their fish maw baked with running chicken - the flavours were very complementary and the fish maw was cooked just right.\n\nThe restaurant isn't that nice looking; decor is simple and a bit dated, with tables fairly placed close together. They have two private rooms. It has a little bit of a hole-in-the-wall feeling but prices certainly were at par if not even more expensive than other restaurants with much nicer decor.\n\nWorth it to come back for the food, but not necessarily to present to visitors given the overall ambiance and dining experience.",

Some dishes were a bit oily.\n\nMy favourite was their fish maw baked with running chicken - the flavours were very complementary and the fish maw was cooked just right.\n\nThe restaurant isn't that nice looking; decor is simple and a bit dated, with tables fairly placed close together. They have two private rooms. It has a little bit of a hole-in-the-wall feeling but prices certainly were at par if not even more expensive than other restaurants with much nicer decor.\n\nWorth it to come back for the food, but not necessarily to present to visitors given the overall ambiance and dining experience.",

We finished eating all within 1 hour because they forced us as there was another booking coming in. They didnt squeeze our booking in or didn't tell us ahead of time we had only 1 hour. Our table didn't even have enough space for all the 8 dishes and the waiters were embarrassed as they kept bringing the dishes and kept apologizing. Soup was spilled everywhere as there were absolutely no space at the table and they pressured us to finish the dishes quickly to make space for other dishes. When we asked them to slow down the dishes, they said they had no control over the chef. It was a full house at the restaurant and all the dishes at our table came all at once. That's basically forcing us to finish quickly and leave. Will not return again. Dinner was not cheap.",
