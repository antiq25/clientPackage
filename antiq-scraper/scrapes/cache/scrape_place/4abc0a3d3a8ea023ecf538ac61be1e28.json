Everyone at the gym was kind and helpful especially my lovely trainer, Rachel. Rachel was tough at times, I used to call her evil, and very caring and attentive on the days I was feeling down. I enjoyed training with Rachel, I enjoyed the music she used to play for my sessions and I was very happy with the transformation I saw on my body after only 2 months of training. Also, I appreciate how Rachel was very understanding of my busy schedule and how she used to push me to keep coming to the sessions regularly. I am very happy with the results I achieved in the 6 months of training with Rachel and I would've continued working with her if I didn't have to move out of town. All the best Rachel :)",

I have known David for several years and his energy is infectious. I dealt with bloating, hypothyroidism and iron deficiency while doing shift work which all lead to a decline in my health. I went from almost 130lbs of \"skinny fat\" to 114lbs of muscle. He has helped me obtain the physique I've always wanted and the strength I never knew that I had. He's incredibly attentive, knowledgeable, and an overall genuine trainer and boxing coach.  His positive attitude and approachable nature makes me feel completely at ease. I cannot recommend David enough as he truly knows what he is doing and you will see how he genuinely cares about your goals. He radiates passion and dedication for his clients and I absolutely love training with him. He will make you succeed with your fitness goals. If you're seeking a trainer who will produce results and make you enjoy it at the same time - you have found the right place. My only regret is not starting with him sooner. I am so incredibly happy - Thank you David and the amazing Blk Box Team ",

I trained for two years prior to Blk Box at commercial gyms and I noticed little chances to my body. The tailored program at Blk Box actually made a difference and I could see how my body changed every single week; not to mention what a pleasure it was to work with Ken. He's extremely knowledgeable you can ask him anything training related and he would be able to answer you. He even helped me recovered from an old injury that prevented me from doing many of the movements. Every single trainer at the gym is friendly and has his/her own personality that you can fell in love with. His rate is also very reasonable comparing to other personal trainers. I'm excited to see how Blk Box continues to grow!",
