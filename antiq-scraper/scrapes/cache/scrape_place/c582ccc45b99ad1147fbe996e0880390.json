            "review_text": "The Great Canadian Landscaping company did a moderate-sized backyard reno and design for us in October and November. They did a fantastic job and showed up every day until the job was completed, on time and on budget. Stephane and the rest of the crew were a pleasure to work with, and were very meticulous about all details, and had some great suggestions. The backyard looks amazing, and they left the worksite spotless. Can't wait for summer to enjoy it! We highly recommend this company and will definitely use them again!",

Our previous company over salted and killed a number of our garden plants as well as an expensive hedge. As well their attention to snow clearing was lacking at best. I was constantly out clearing our walkways and the city sidewalks that where our legal responsibility. GCLC uses IceMelt, a pet safe product, and a much more careful and thoughtful application that seems to not affect our plants as much, AND the \"gold star\", the snow clearing is down to the concrete. Our sidewalks are clearer than our neighbours! The areas around entrances, recycling and garbage areas are thoroughly cleared making me worry less for my older neighbours whom the slippery conditions are a hazard. Thank you GCLC!
