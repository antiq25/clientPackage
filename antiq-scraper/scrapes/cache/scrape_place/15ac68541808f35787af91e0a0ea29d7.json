What was unexpected was that the dishes we weren't considering a la carte turned out to be total hits. The raddiccio, cheddar, apple and ham salad was incredible - light, with a sweet and savory balance. The lingcod had the most ethereal vadouvan spiced sauce and flavourful fingerling potatoes. And the sauce gribiche for the cured steelhead was a standout.\n\nThe final savoury course - the pork cheeks with spaetzle, plentiful chanterelles and sourdough breadcrumb - was perfection.\n\nLoved everything about the place, and unbeatable value with today's prices. Highly recommend.",

What was unexpected was that the dishes we weren't considering a la carte turned out to be total hits. The raddiccio, cheddar, apple and ham salad was incredible - light, with a sweet and savory balance. The lingcod had the most ethereal vadouvan spiced sauce and flavourful fingerling potatoes. And the sauce gribiche for the cured steelhead was a standout.\n\nThe final savoury course - the pork cheeks with spaetzle, plentiful chanterelles and sourdough breadcrumb - was perfection.\n\nLoved everything about the place, and unbeatable value with today's prices. Highly recommend.",

The space is small but feels very warm and comforting\n\nFoods : We got the 64$ menu per person for two people which allow us to get 2 snacks, two appetizers, two main course and a dessert. The foods are actually above our expectations. We know we will get good foods, but we expect to eat at duffins or panago after because we thought we will be still hungry due to the portion in reality, the foods portion is PERFECT for two people.\n\nFlavour wise, combining fresh ingredients from local farms and fisheries, we feel that every food has been given much thought, care and love. Everything is fresh, from the lettuce to the lingcod. Our favourite of the night was the pork cheek. WE DON'T HAVE TO CHEW IT!! it was so tender and so much flavours.\n\nService : top notch service. Jes served us yesterday and she was so informative, polite and very thoughtful, explaining the menu and cater to my girlfriend's spice intolerance very very seriously. She feels like a friend, not a server! Also, I drink lots and lots of water, so i appreciate tht they put a bottle of water on our table!\n\nOverall 5/5. We will come back and TELL our friends to come here because we believe Gary's is a great place to be and a place for people to feel comfortable, full and feel welcomed everytime.\n\nGOOD JOB!",
