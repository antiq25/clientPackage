I booked an appointment for our dog to be groomed so she would be out of the house when the movers arrived and the friends she would stay at for 3 days while we moved asked that she be groomed to prevent shedding on their furniture. I woke up on moving day at 6:30 to walk the dog and brush her before her appointment. I showed up on time only to be told the appointment was cancelled because staff called in sick. I wasn't offered any alternative and they wouldn't even let me buy any products in the store because \"it was too early\" even though I saw a bunch of staff in there. I called all the other grooming shops in the area and they are all full for today. Now I have movers showing up and nowhere to put my dog for the day. It's too hot to leave her in the car. And I can't take her to my friend's house for the next couple of days Because she hasn't been groomed as was asked. I work in the service industry and I understand people call in sick. But sometimes you have to buckle down and make it work. A manager might need to step in and pick up some grooming, shears, or else you need to take five minutes off every appointment in the day in order to squeeze in an extra client or else work a little bit later. I'm very disappointed with the lack of sympathy, lack of effort to rectify their own issue. From now on I'll stick to the little guys. They're cheaper anyway.\n\n** update  I couldn't help but call in and talk to the manager. He was kind and offered another appointment on another day as well as a credit. It didn't help us out the day of and would've been nice if they had offered this during the initial visit.\n\n5 stars for the quality of the care/grooming of my pet",
