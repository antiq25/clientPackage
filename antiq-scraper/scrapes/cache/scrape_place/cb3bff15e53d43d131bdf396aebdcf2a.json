Too much juicy meat, too much of the crispiest bacons I ever had, too much of the peanut butter, not even thinking to try to stay between the patties. Overall it wasn't the best burger I ever had, but a very good one. The poutine on the other hand really kicked in. I've never tried it that way, the chaos of flavor was a special treatment for my tounge, in a great way.\n\nThe girls working here are very kind and also handling situations with a \"I believe it's real\" smile. Nothing to complain here.\n\nIf I ever come back to Vancouver again, this will be on my bucket list for sure. And next time I'm gonna ask for some wet tissues first, before I have to see my fingers being soaked up in PB again.",
