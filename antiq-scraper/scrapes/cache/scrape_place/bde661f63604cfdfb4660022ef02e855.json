The staff member on the phone was very helpful and informed me that THEY WOULD CALL ME BEFORE I would be charged, close to the end of the period of freeze. I thought that it would be nice. They didn't call me and I WAS CHARGED even though I was unable to practice any physical activity. I called them to inform about what was agreed (what the employee had told me), they said that no one would call me. It is not the client's fault the training structure they offer to their employees.I didn't receive any refund, even I saying that I could send them the doctor's note.\n\n2. Then, with a newborn at home, I requested the freeze again in a different period, and 2 days later, I WAS CHARGED. This is unacceptable. It is no the customer problem how is the financial dynamic of the company. We didn't receive the refund!\n\nFinally, we requested to cancel the membership and also because we moved to Calgary. The staff member said that they need 30 days notice - what wasn't informed to us when we signed up. We said that we wanted to cancel right away and we also requested our refund for what we were charged on the 2nd time. The lady said that she would cancel it but the refund could not be made.\n\nAt the end of the day, we basically paid the 30 days notice with the money that we should receive as a refund (for the 2nd inappropriate charge).\n\nWe feel extremely harmed by this company, we feel that we were charged inappropriately. This is a company that cannot be trusted and that does not treat its customers honestly.\n\nIf you want to avoid headaches, avoid GoodLife Fitness.",

It is FREE(undergroud) they share the same parking space with the Element Hotel on P2 level\n(Don't pay for the parking until you entering the gym in 2nd floor)\nYou will see a machine which offers you 2 hrs FREE parking\n-Cleaness. I've been tryung out 3 different locations in Calgary Goodlife\nNone of those is satisfy until the first time I visited this one in Burnaby.\nBoth the gym & mens changing room are very tidy and clean.(sorry no chance visiting the women changing room)\nAnd this is the only location I did my showers in 7 continue days.\nThe staff entering opposition gender changing room\nI read complaints about this issue which is a male staff entering the women changing room to help a member w/o any notice\nThe same thing happen yesterday\nA male member lost his key for his locker so a female staff entered tge mem's room to help him to cut his lock.\nAlso the female staff did not get anyone's attention before go in.\n*(This is for sure an issue & hope the mangement can look into it ASAP)\n-Shortage of towel\nEverytime I obtain a clean &fresh towel when entering the gym. They may had that probelm years ago, but nit any more\n-service of the staff\nThey are very friendly & helpful. The 1st time I couldn't find the entrance of the parking lot, so I called and the staff explained very clearly and be very patient to my questions.\nAnd everyday when I left the gym\nThey say goodbye with a smiling face\n-Equipment. this is the location with all the equipments I need.\n-Other member attitude\nOther member are also friendly, even sometime some people spend very long time on 1 machine(20mins). However, if you ask them and they are willing to share the machine in bewteen time.\n\nConclusion: there maybe some other location has a even better standard comapring to this Metrotown location\nHowever, I have no complaint and also no bad feeling about this location in my last 7 days trial. Thank you and hope these infomation helps for your decision.",

            "review_text": "I started with GoodLife in Calgary, AB not long ago.\nAnd I was sent by my company to work in Vancouver for this Oct month.\nSo I started to google where is the nearest Goodlife in town.\nAfter some research I picked this one(called Metrotown)but the location is actually right across Crystal Shopping Mall\nI spent the last 7 days at this gym (at least 2 hours a day).\nHere to share some of my own experience for the people who is planning to join.\n-Parking. It is FREE(undergroud) they share the same parking space with the Element Hotel on P2 level\n(Don't pay for the parking until you entering the gym in 2nd floor)\nYou will see a machine which offers you 2 hrs FREE parking\n-Cleaness. I've been tryung out 3 different locations in Calgary Goodlife\nNone of those is satisfy until the first time I visited this one in Burnaby.\nBoth the gym & mens changing room are very tidy and clean.(sorry no chance visiting the women changing room)\nAnd this is the only location I did my showers in 7 continue days.\nThe staff entering opposition gender changing room\nI read complaints about this issue which is a male staff entering the women changing room to help a member w/o any notice\nThe same thing happen yesterday\nA male member lost his key for his locker so a female staff entered tge mem's room to help him to cut his lock.\nAlso the female staff did not get anyone's attention before go in.\n*(This is for sure an issue & hope the mangement can look into it ASAP)\n-Shortage of towel\nEverytime I obtain a clean &fresh towel when entering the gym. They may had that probelm years ago, but nit any more\n-service of the staff\nThey are very friendly & helpful. The 1st time I couldn't find the entrance of the parking lot, so I called and the staff explained very clearly and be very patient to my questions.\nAnd everyday when I left the gym\nThey say goodbye with a smiling face\n-Equipment. this is the location with all the equipments I need.\n-Other member attitude\nOther member are also friendly, even sometime some people spend very long time on 1 machine(20mins). However, if you ask them and they are willing to share the machine in bewteen time.\n\nConclusion: there maybe some other location has a even better standard comapring to this Metrotown location\nHowever, I have no complaint and also no bad feeling about this location in my last 7 days trial. Thank you and hope these infomation helps for your decision.",

It's the only GoodLife near me and after reading all the reviews saying not to come between 5-10, I decided to try it out at 10:15pm on a Monday night. It. Was. Packed. The equipment is fine and exactly the same as any other GoodLife, but you won't get to use it. The space is waaay too small for the population it's trying to serve. I also didn't like how the whole place shakes whenever someone drops their weights (due to being on the second floor), which is constantly. I can't see how working out here after work is even possible and I have cancelled my GoodLife membership as a result. The space is clean, the staff are friendly enough, but I come to work out, not stand around.",

But worst is that they only have 1 hack squat and it's been out of commission for 3 months going on 4. Again they can fit 2 of these in case one goes down.\nI hope they're saving to buy 2 new ones, everyone in the gym is displeased with this.\nI'll happily change my review if the facility was taken care of better",
