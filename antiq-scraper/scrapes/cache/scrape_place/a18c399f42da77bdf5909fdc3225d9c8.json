The rooms are nice clean and comfortable, Breakfast was good and enough to get you started and ready for your day. I stayed here 2 weekend's in a row total of 4 nights. The housekeeper Li (both w-ends) was very nice and friendly. The hotel is well located, conveniently close to the airport (24/7 complimentary shuttle or if you are driving secure parking is available) close to the Bridgeport Station (about 10 minutes walk) where you can take the TransLink Metro, Vancouver's transportation network, it will allow you to go anywhere, either by train or bus.
