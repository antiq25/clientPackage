The Laksa I ordered was a bit on the sweet side and it seemed to lack a bit of salt. But it was still pretty good. I know it need more salt cause the one I had tried in Singapore was a lot spicier and had the salty umami.\n\nThe Nasi Lemak did not taste like the rice had been in coconut milk. And my wife felt like the rice also seemed undercooked, or perhaps it had dried out because the rice was quite firm.\n\nOverall, this place has a lot of potential, but I would hope that those 2 dishes become their best executions because that is what Singapore and Malaysia are known for.\n\nI hope you come back and try some more!",
