So the lady on the call confirmed to write email to the boutique to call me and its been two days no one reached out to me still. So pathetic quality product and above the pathetic customer service. The audacity of this brand I tell you. I recommend Gucci brand to please learn some quality and customer service from \"Coach\" I bought few bags from them and they have amazing customer service and quality. They even remember my name everytime I walkin and makes me feel welcome and above everything quality of product is just amazing. I will go to the boutique and take my bag and never ever buy gucci again.",
