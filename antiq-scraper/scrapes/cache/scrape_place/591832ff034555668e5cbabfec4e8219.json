I gave them early notice because I knew not all of the items would be regular stock. I was assured that everything would be there and ready. I showed up to find out that they had no record of my order, and only had 1 of the 4 items I needed. I put my faith in their ability to stay organized and was let down. Definitely will never support this business again.",
