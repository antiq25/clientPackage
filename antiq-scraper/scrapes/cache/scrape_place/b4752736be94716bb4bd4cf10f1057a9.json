I don't mind waiting here, I said nicely. I rolled up my window and sat there on my phone. They had a long line in drive through. My burgers came within 30 seconds. Lol I hate it I dunno y they make me wait most times for a normal order. I'm not ordering the pizza or anything out of the ordinary. So loophole just hold the line up. LOL THEY HAVE TO PRIORITIZE YOU AND GET THE LINE MOVING. And as I was taught. The customer service. It's a virus. If ONE person has bad service it can spread, possibly this someone who has been there a long time with seniority? I do believe it can trickle down. Well if he's being lazy then I'm being lazy.

This makes no sense to me I've never been to a restaurant where you're willing to pay for a product and they say no to you especially if it's just WATER. Especially when you're spending 30 to $40 each time just for two people you would expect better service. I hope management gets involved in actually makes a difference and teaches these people customer service it seems that customer service has gone down the drain. The employees act annoyed to serve you. It's super sad. I miss the good old days of good customer service. Not a Karen just want basic customer service.",
