The rack of lamb is always cooked to perfection and the mashed potatoes is to die for because it's not like any mashed potatoes I've ever had its sweet but savory at the same time. The portions are big plenty of veggies on the plate and presentation is always beautiful. The seafood pasta is so delish! I love the variety and amount of seafood that it comes with. Today my friend and I shared the mushroom soup. It was one of the features of the night and it was the best mushroom soup I've ever tasted! Rich, creamy and packed with flavor! I loved how the mushroom was blended but u can still taste the mushrooms and it had a nice garlic flavor. I wish it was a permanent item on the menu I'd take this mushroom soup over the clam chowder anytime! Our servers Arturo and Teddy bear both give great service with a great sense of humor! Hopefully next time I'll try something else off the menu!",

It is my brother's favourite place, but it has been a while for me since I no longer live nearby. Not only did the food exceed our expectations, so did the service.\n\nI had the smoked sablefish, which was accompanied by a huge portion of veggies. It was a good portion, and super well plated. Others had the New York steak, cedar planked salmon, the salmon Wellington, and rack of lamb. Everyone was super happy with their meals. We also ordered the calamari starter, which was very fresh! The meal came with their complimentary warm bread and lobster oil, which was divine.\n\nThe star was our server. The lone man appeared to be working the entire restaurant alone. Serving, taking orders, and even bartending. He didn't skip a beat, and I was blown away. He deserves 5 stars and a big raise/bonus! Thank you for a wonderful evening,",

After a two decade run, security conscious Port of Vancouver ended the restaurant's lease. Chef Eddy and a few others moved from The Cannery and began Pink Peppercorn Seafood House, taking with them many favourite recipes as well as the rustic maritime theme. An August visit to the Kingsway dining spot refreshed happy memories of The Cannery.\nFrom the initial greeting to our departure, service was friendly and attentive, without being intrusive. To start, we enjoyed bread and the signature Lobster Oil dip with balsamic vinegar. She had mushroom and roasted garlic soup, I had lobster bisque. Both delicious. Her entree was Sablefish with a lemon butter sauce, mine was Salmon Wellington. Each came with asparagus and broccoli, perfectly cooked to tender crisp. Portions are huge so take-home containers are pretty routine. The menu is broad and suitable for most tastes. It's a family friendly restaurant more worthy of our support than outlets of the corporate chains that dominate Vancouver dining.",
