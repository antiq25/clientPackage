Crab Cakes,Truffle Spot Prawn Mac n Cheese)\n\nTo celebrate the launch of their fall seasonal menu, Fresh Ideas Start Here was offering a small bowl of complimentary seafood congee to the first 50 customers who came into their store and mentioned the word \"halibut.\" We'd never tried this seafood congee before, but apparently it's a \"cult favourite\" so we went to the store right when it opened and managed to bring home some of this famed seafood congee.\n\nOh wow! This seafood congee exceeded my expectations. I totally understand now why it's a cult favourite. It was packed with seafood. They don't skimp on ingredients at this place. According to the stickers stuck onto our containers, a small congee is normally $6 and a large congee is normally $8. I would absolutely go back and pay to have this seafood congee again! I'm so happy that it's Fall now. With hot summer days leaving, and cooler weather arriving, we should definitely have a reason to go back for the seafood congee!\n\nService: Good\nParking: Plentiful and free\nLocation: 7515 Market Crossing #180, Burnaby",

It's jam packed full of fresh poke and ingredients.  Need some super fresh seafood as well!   They have all that as well.  Can't be any fresher then them processing it in the store.  They do have some frozen products as well, but mainly fresh.  You won't be disappointed",
