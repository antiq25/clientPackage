Anyway, I would have given the review couple more stars if it wasn't for the inconvenience. It was Sunday morning and I was going to use the ATM but before I open the door I notice a homeless person sleeping on the ground near the ATM machines. This is a young guy in his 20s or 30s. As you can see in my picture attached you can see some sleeping on the ground. As a result I didn't even bother going in as I had a separate similar experience at another location. I am not discriminating homeless people but they shouldn't sleep inside the financial institution. It just make some people feel uncomfortable doing banking. I wish Vancity would do something about it.",

Having to walk over to find a closed branch on Monday when I definitely needed to do a face to face meeting is very frustrating.  Sure there are other Vancity branches open, but now I need to drive my gasoline powered car to another branch further away is definitely not good to the environment!\n\nPlease don't make lame excuses and respond directly to why the Victoria Drive branch cannot open Monday to Saturday just like other financial institutions nearby?",

However, while there has always been a lot of turnover, there are now many young men working here who couldn't care less that customers may have other things to do besides wait in line for 10+ minutes while they work as though they are asleep. Of course, they constantly wear their masks under their nose or take it off entirely to speak. Very disappointed.",
