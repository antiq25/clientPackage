I will not take him my car care needs again.\n\nI came into the shop at 10:58 AM, I know because I looked at my phone, I was busy and was watching the time carefully. Randy said hi and asked me what I was in for. I said a tire with a not so slow leak. Randy then said have a seat.\n\nWhile waiting in the lobby of his messy little shop he was taking payment from a customer named \"Jodie\" they talked about his and her children, grand children and her career working with children. That was a 12 minute conversation. Then a fellow came in an he had a tire with him, Randy dealt with him his tire was whisked away into the garage and he sat in the waiting area with me and one other fellow\n\nRandy went into the back of the shop, came out, sat at his desk and while using the computer took out a plastic food container and fork and began eating a bit. He then went back into the garage area at back of the shop.\n\nAt that time the fellow (customer) who was dealt with ahead of me even though I came in before them was speaking to me and I had said It has been 37 minutes since he asked me to have a seat. The other customer said ring the bell and I said, he knows I am here, he told me to have a seat for a moment and I have been here for 20 minutes before you came in, he knows I am here.\n\nRandy then comes toward the waiting area and interrupts our conversation with a question what about was said about the bell on the desk. I said I was speaking with this gentleman. Randy then says well you are arguing about the bell. I said Randy no one is arguing about anything and the conversation was between me and the man I was speaking with. I said you ask me to wait a moment and have a seat then 37 minutes later the thing you want to address / say to me is to interrupt a casual conversation with another and characterize it as arguing and not to ask how can you help me?\n\nI said there is no problem waiting but if you knew that it would be 40 minutes before you would even speak to me why would you not value my time and tell me that, why not tell me you will be taking other customers before me, doing working on your computer and having something to eat, please come back later or call / book online.\n\nafter I asked that Randy then told me to get out of the shop and don't come back...\n\nHe then nastily said and pick up your coffee off the table and get out. I said I have not come here to take orders from you, how can you be so rude?\n\nHe then said fine don't leave. I said really you are going to try to play mind games with a paying customer and try to use reverse psychology. I mentioned what I do in mental heath and he scoffed and laughed right in my face as he mockingly says \"psychologist\".\n\nHe then kept on being rude and following me out the door, I said you wasted 37 minutes of my time already, he then says \"it is 39 minutes\" now and called me a broken person who could not be helped...",

            "response_from_owner_text": "The video recording demonstrates how foolish you acted and how the others waiting around you laughed at you after you left (in case you have the ability to self-reflect). One person, with a head-shake of disbelief, pitied the 'beneficiaries' of your psychological work. Now I'm seeing the irony in how a person trained to understand humankind can't wrap his mind around a simple concept of 'waiting one's turn - no babysitting required' & 'complaining as a way to force entitlement on others'.\n\nThere was also discussion about how you openly usurped the authority of God Almighty in your feeble attempt at bullying as if 'the powers had been vested in you' or some other silly nonsense. We don't tolerate such behavior so when you began attacking, accusing, and displaying prejudice... ya, you're going to have to leave. Permanently.  Discrediting Christianity by representing it horribly is a symptom of something quite negative.\n\nCLARIFICATION: you as a no-appointment drop-in were assured that we would be able to assist you in repairing a tire without having to leave it and return (unlike the other shops you tried). The shop was informed that you (a drop-in tire repair) were waiting to have your tire repaired. The shop (not me as I'm not the person in the back doing the tire repairs (as you erroneously concluded)) continued with the work that was booked before you while I, doing my part, ensured that the shop ran smoothly. I also took payment/invoiced a customer who's vehicle was completed, had a conversation with a customer as part of my lunch-break, and spent a couple minutes actually eating my lunch and replying to emails. I think the rest of your utter misconstrued blah blah blah above demonstrates the rest of the story.\n\nComplaining to others who were waiting then denying when I overheard and attempted to explain was also immature.\n\nWe don't like people who berate/belittle service industry people. We don't like people who place themselves above their neighbours. We don't like people who are openly judgmental. And we don't like people who bring negativity (toxicity) into our space. You are all of these things. Standing up and blurting out - as some type of qualifier - that you are a psychologist so you know Randy is wrong sealed the deal.\n\nEnjoy your life. Enjoy the ramifications of the path you've justified taking. Enjoy blessing another shop in Vancouver with your superiority complex. We all enjoyed the relief and peace that was restored after you stomped off like a child. Our world is better without you.\n\nBlessings & buh-bye. \n",
