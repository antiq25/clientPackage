But it's the placement of equipment paired with the shortage of equipment to match the volume of customers. This is a busy gym, and they waste so much space. 1/3 of the gym is filled with cardio equipment which is barely used. A very small free weight section. A large personal trainer section which is barely utilized, with a lot of that equipment being desperately needed by all the people going. The personal training area has too many squat racks, with not enough for everyone else. There is a large transition area towards a female only area. The transition has a few pieces of equipment for stretching and that's about it. It could have been used for more free weight area, which again is very needed. Would not recommend this gym in its current state. There are better GoodLife's.",

Specifically the cardio machines. They either don't adjust with the buttons, are in very poor shape, or they simply just shut off randomly. I've worked out in the co-ed side at night and have been harassed by other men who exercise there. Now the women's area is the only place I feel comfortable exercising in and even that area is below expectations. The steam room is always off. Towels everywhere, just overall unkept.\n\nThey also just got rid of the tanning beds completely. Prior to this their tanning was limited to every 24hours, in which they changed it to 48hrs, then just completely removed the service as a whole. I'm not sure what my membership even entitles anymore. It's not worth the price to exercise here unless the 24hour option is convenient for you. I was quoted less of a biweekly rate at Club Fitness right next door at Lougheed Mall which has way better equipment AND 24hr/tanning + classes with no contract commitments. Please do better as a gym to serve your existing clients as the condition of this gym is extremely dissatisfactory for the rates you are making members pay.",

The staff and management don't seem to care to fix anything if it's broken unlike other gyms that fix anything broken within weeks. Not to mention it's also the most expensive membership I hold out of 4 gyms",
