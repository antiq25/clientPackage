The rest was sweet and tasted exactly as expected, especially the strawberry cake and the lychee black tea. Not to make that sound bad, they're staples in every store for a reason (they never miss)!! Though, not going to lie, wasn't a huge fan of the honeycomb in my dalgona latte as it was too sweet and it was slightly unnerving every time I'd encounter its crunchy texture. Still drank it all, but probably wouldn't get it again...\n\nOther than that, the decor was nice and clean and the atmosphere was quiet and serene. Also, it's a little on the expensive side... so definitely more of an experience than a regular hang-out spot. Hope the employees enjoyed the relaxing morning as it seemed like a slow shift (to be fair we went around brunch time on a Tuesday). Tldr, worth it to try the rose oolong peach cake and experience the fun of the stacking cake cups.",

The cake was refreshing and smooth with crunchy chocolate bites. The lavender flavour in the drink was strong, and I liked that it wasn't overpowered by the blueberry. The plastic cake cylinder snaps onto the drink lid for easy transport. The shop is clean with cute decor. It's a tad pricey so not your everyday treat, but they have unique flavours that warrant a trip back.",

The cake is still edible but the cream and chocolate are all over the place. I did not swing the cake whatsoever but I am so disappointed that a $45-dollar cake has that weak packaging and cannot hold the cake for even 5 minutes under normal usage.\n\nHopefully the cake tastes good.
