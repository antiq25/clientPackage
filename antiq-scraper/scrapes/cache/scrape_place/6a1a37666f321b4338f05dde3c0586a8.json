He shared us his honest opinions and can always pick up details we didn't notice. He answered us whenever we have questions regardless weekdays or weekends, daytime or nighttime. We eventually got this great deal in Metro Burnaby, which originally thought to be much more expensive. He made the whole completion process so smooth that we didn't had any trouble. He's indeed Top 1% realtor. We greatly appreciate his hard work and professionalism.",

It started with busstops, billboards, note pads... then one day I was driving down Kingsway and bam!!  right beside me is a 4 foot image on a car of Brandon! I went home and told my wife I think I found our realtor. I called Brandon and he came to our current home at the time and gave us a breakdown on market/value. He is very well spoken , confident , handsome young man and has his finger on the heartbeat of the market so we decided to list. We listed aggressively as he suggested and this fetched us multiple offers with our property going 80k over asking!! What a beauty! This was only one experience with Brandon. The second experience is a single family home in Montecito burnaby. I had fully renovated. Brandon showed up and fell in love with the place. I told Brandon \"do you think we can get $2.5\" we had purchased 1.5 years prior for $1.840 he said yeah l let's try! I believed that if anyone could fetch this number it would be him. Brandon had beautiful photos taken, drone shots, and a walk through video featuring,  yes! The one and only Brandon Gee Moore!! Brandon got us the number we wanted yet again for another huge win. Now we had sold and we did not have a house to move to only a pocket full of cash. This is great but not when you have a pregnant wife and two other kids! He worked day and night until he found us our dream property. No wonder this guy is top 1% . If you can say Brandon you can say SOLD!",

Working with the right realtor really worked for us and I realised that at crucial points during the buying process where quick decisions need to be made and good advice, experience and reputation is invaluable. That's why Brandon is the the best. Bonus is he's very affable, friendly, committed, easy to talk to, well-liked and respected in the industry. Go with Brandon!",
