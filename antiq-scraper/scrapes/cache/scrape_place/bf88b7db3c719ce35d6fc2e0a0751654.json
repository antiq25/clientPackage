A guy was doing coke and banging on the walls in the bathroom. The staff were informed more then 7 times and manager did nothing. My husbands life was threatened and was the only reason the cops were called. I'm super displeased with the management. They need to teach their staff and mangers proper procedures. There was little kids running around watching this as well. My ten year old son couldn't even use to bathroom and we had to take him home as he was so terrified. They need to hire a security team if they are scared to deal with problems themselves.",

I felt like I was dismissed and ignored as the person didn't even acknowledge my side and the fact that I waited that long for 2 burgers.\n\nI waited another 10 minutes for the order to be made and I was on the phone when the order came and there were no apologies whatsover when the order was handed to me and I left the parking lot at 937pm.\n\nMassively disappointed.

After I placed my order and paid is when the real waiting started. Almost 15 minutes for my order. Finally got my food after I counted about 8 cars order and go thru the drive theu window. Obviously this store does not place any kind of priority on the inside restaurant orders. All the resources are used for the drive thru. Even the Indian lady who I would say was a manager as she had a sweater and different shirt on was helping in drive thru. Lots of the tables were dirty when we went to sit down with my kids. The only reason I come to this location is for the play center. I will probably be avoiding this mcdonalds as the service is non existent and the men's restroom was filthy and the door didn't even have a lock. Looks like it hasn't been cleaned in days. I suggest you print a log for your restrooms and check them hourly. This is an embarrassment to any food place. I've gone in to cleaner restrooms in a 3rd world country.",
