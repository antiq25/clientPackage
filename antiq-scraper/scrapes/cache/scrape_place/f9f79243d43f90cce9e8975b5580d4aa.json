No indoor or covered seating.\n\nWe tried the Cod fish and chips. Excellent batter and the fries were delicious. Tatar sauce was rich and satisfying. Coleslaw was underwhelming and slightly boring.\n\nWe also had the Oyster \"Po Boy\" sandwich. The flavour was amazing and unique. Highly recommend.\n\nOverall, great service and exciting sandwich menu. Fish and chips were above par. I wished there were some covered seating as you're completely exposed to the elements.\n\nOf note: walking distance to Granville Island! Also, expect to wait to be served during peak hours.",
