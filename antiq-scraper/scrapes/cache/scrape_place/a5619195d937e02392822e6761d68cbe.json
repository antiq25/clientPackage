No problem with ordering or going to the window. The problem my head was after I drove away and I was ready to take a sip of my thoughts, so hot coffee ended up being ice cold as far as my muffin well, it literally looks like somebody stuck their finger into it and did not smell very pleasant. It looked really gross and another thing was it felt like it was in the freezer and it was defrosting and they gave it to me. It looks like a disaster. It was so disgusting looking at it. I ended up throwing it out into the bush for the birds to eat and I feel bad for them and my coffee. I just dumped it out and just went over to Tim Hortons after and I actually got a hot coffee and a really nice muffin way to go McDonald's anyways everybody have a wonderful day thank you for taking the time to read this",
