Keep in mind, when you do that, the ticket says you picked your stuff up.\n\nI came back and called the number to let them know i was there.  No answer.  I happened to see a young lady who was doing the curside delivery, and asked if she could help me (i waited until she was done with her delivery).  She first ignored me and the pointed to a sign and said, \"call the number or use the app.\"\n\nI ended up walking into the store, finding a manager and asking her for help.  She then went to the back, found my freezer, with a note, and told them I was there.  Then the same girl came out and brought it to me!  Of course, with an attitude.
