Trying to cancel an appointment is nearly impossible - they expect you to notify them 24 hours ahead to cancel your appointment otherwise will charge you a fee, but when you go to cancel online the online booking says unable to cancel due to being <48hrs and to call the clinic to cancel? Then if you try calling, they don't answer their phone because their hours to pick up the phone is 9-12? Because of covid?? They are always rude whenever I tried booking or calling about anything. I had to get a form filled out by my doctor which she was willing to do as it was healthcare work related, then when I call the office the receptionist doesn't allow me to speak to her or let me get the form filled unless I pay 40$? After speaking with my doctor directly she didn't even mention a charge being needed. They seriously need to rethink how they deliver patient centred care as their clinic is far from that.",

I called to book an appointment with my doctor. The receptionist asked me what's the reason. I have been coughing for over a week and tested negative for COVID multiple times. Sometimes when I cough a lot, it is hard to breathe. The receptionist replied, \"GO URGENT CARE!!\" Then she hung up on me.\n\nThe worst interaction ever! No patients deserve to be yelled at when they feel ill and need care. I wanted to book an appointment because I did not want to go to urgent care and put extra pressure on the hospital. I want to save it for those who really need it. Health care is a public good. It is morally wrong for clinics to choose what patients to take. I agree with all the previous reviews that J-Von only wants your money. This clinic does not really care about your health.\n\nMy doctor is quitting soon, and I will not miss this clinic.",
