They pre-order the crab once you confirm your reservation and show you the crab before bringing it into the kitchen to cook (it was alive and flailing). The crab was perfectly cooked into 4 dishes. The legs and claws were steamed with garlic, the body fried with salt/pepper/shallot/garlic, seafood fried rice was baked into the shell, and residual meat/juice was used to poach some yuchoy. Everything was perfectly cooked and tasted fresh and delicious. Service was amazing too. You have to drive through some shady areas of Vancouver, but definitely work the trip. Highly recommend and would go back in a heartbeat.",

They pre-order the crab once you confirm your reservation and show you the crab before bringing it into the kitchen to cook (it was alive and flailing). The crab was perfectly cooked into 4 dishes. The legs and claws were steamed with garlic, the body fried with salt/pepper/shallot/garlic, seafood fried rice was baked into the shell, and residual meat/juice was used to poach some yuchoy. Everything was perfectly cooked and tasted fresh and delicious. Service was amazing too. You have to drive through some shady areas of Vancouver, but definitely work the trip. Highly recommend and would go back in a heartbeat.",

If you're an adventurous foodie seeking new taste experiences, this place is a hidden gem that deserves your attention. However, if you're looking for a visually stunning, Instagram-worthy ambiance, well, let's just say you won't find it here.\n\nUpon entering Pelican Restaurant, you may be underwhelmed by its lackluster decor. But remember, it's the taste that matters, right? And boy, oh boy, did Pelican deliver in that department. Every dish we devoured was an explosion of flavors that made our taste buds dance happily.\n\nWe decided to visit Pelican for brunch, and it turned out to be an epic choice. Who needs pancakes and eggs benedict when you can have a unique culinary experience like no other? We knew we were in for something extraordinary when they opened their doors at 10 am.\n\nThe menu at Pelican is a delightful mishmash of creative concoctions that will challenge your preconceived notions of what a brunch should be. Expect the unexpected as you peruse through their intriguing selection. From out-of-this-world flavor combinations to random ingredients, Pelican dares to push the boundaries of culinary norms.\n\nAs we devoured each plate, we couldn't help but appreciate the boldness and creativity that went into the dishes. Pelican Restaurant is a playground for innovative flavors and unexpected pairings.\n\nSure, the decor might not be Insta-worthy, and the ambiance lacks pizzazz, but who needs that when the food is this extraordinary? Pelican is a haven for true food enthusiasts who are willing to step outside their comfort zones and embrace the weird and wonderful.\n\nSo, if you're a true gastronomic adventurer seeking a new experience of taste, make your way to Pelican Restaurant in East Hastings. Come with an open mind, and an empty stomach, and prepare to have your taste buds blown away. Trust me, it's a brunch you won't soon forget.",

The duck and chicken came out with crispy skin so that was bomb. Tea was strong and dark too, tieguanyin tea. TIP: If you come with large party, call ahead and order ahead so you don't have to wait for them to cook in the back.",

After making me wait a while, they had their kitchen put my order together anew. I will give them kudos for managing to get me my food in 5-10 minutes, but this should've never been the case. When I opened up my order at home, the duck was already sliced up (which is great), but they definitely gave me only half the bird. I was already late for dinner, I called the restaurant after my family had our meal. The guy on the phone said they did indeed give me the whole duck, and the smaller serving is because ducks nowadays are smaller in size. He made sure to tell me that there were two legs and two wings, which I couldn't confirm, since I had called the restaurant after my family had already eaten the dish for dinner. However, as a Chinese person, I have grown up eating many a duck and I know what a whole vs half duck looks like. This barely filled the bottom of their round takeout container. I know that with Peking Duck orders, restaurants will often take part of the duck meat to make lettuce wraps to be served alongside sliced pieces, but this is not what I had ordered, nor did I get any bonus lettuce wraps - my order was one WHOLE duck. If they did give me two wings and legs, my best guess is that they kept the bulk of the duck to make lettuce wraps for some other customer. On top of that, the restaurant claims to give you 15% off for takeout orders, which was also a lie.\n\nSave your money and go somewhere else. Don't get ripped off by this dishonest business.\n\nOr at least be prepared to be charged $45 for a whole quail-sized duck.",
