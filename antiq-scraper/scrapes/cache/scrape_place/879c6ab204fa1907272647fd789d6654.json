So tough to bite into that i dipped them in coffee and still a bit too doughy. Also Iced coffee tasted burnt and I got coffee for my dad who's a diabetic so I asked for Splenda instead of sugar and they didn't put anything in, no sugar, no Splenda, even though in my mobile order and when going through drive through I mentioned both times did you guys put 5 Splendas.",

So tough to bite into that i dipped them in coffee and still a bit too doughy. Also Iced coffee tasted burnt and I got coffee for my dad who's a diabetic so I asked for Splenda instead of sugar and they didn't put anything in, no sugar, no Splenda, even though in my mobile order and when going through drive through I mentioned both times did you guys put 5 Splendas.",
