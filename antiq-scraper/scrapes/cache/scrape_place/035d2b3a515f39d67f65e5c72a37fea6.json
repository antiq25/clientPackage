Even the guacamole which I'm not a big avocado eater I still enjoyed it. The drinks were also good I had a margarita and it was pretty enjoyable. The prices are fairly decent. I'd advice sharing dishes with friends if you're on a budget.",

This time my girlfriend and I went to MI Casa on West 4th.\n\nThe location is at the corner of burrard and west 4th. Park on 4th where there is lots of meter parking. The entrance is on the burrard side. You climb a set of stairs to get to the second floor venue. Watch out on the way in or you will end up in the tattoo shop underneath.\n\nWe shared a tequila lime Margherita which was excellent.\n\nFor dinner we had tried a quesadea platter of 3, a taco Platter of 3, and an enchiladas dish.\n\nThe quesadea we had chicken, beef, and pulled pork. This was excellent and our favorite dish.\n\nThe soft tacos were tasty and good size  we had a beef taco, and 2 different types of pork. They were good but not as good as the quesedia.\n\nFinally we shared the enchiladas. Which came with 3 as well as rice and beans. These were chicken and were a touch dry. The green sauce was ok but this dish was on the bland side.\n\nThe service was ok and the venue was large and clean. We went on a Sunday around 7pm. The place was half full. The food came out quick and the staff gave us everything we needed.\n\nThe place had a fairly large menu and it looks like they do large families or parties well.\n\n$$",
