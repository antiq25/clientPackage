Clearly it was not freshly cooked.\n\nAnother disappointing fact was that they do not have any tempura sushi options.\n\nOverall, this place should be avoided if you are in search of good tasty food.\n\nOnly reason for not giving 1 star is the service.

It's a small place with 15 tables so it's quiet cozy. The only downside was that there was no toilet, atleast not when I asked in june 2023. Pretty weird to not have a toilet in a restaurant. Overall very nice dining though and decently priced aswell! Would recommend if you don't need to use the loo.",
