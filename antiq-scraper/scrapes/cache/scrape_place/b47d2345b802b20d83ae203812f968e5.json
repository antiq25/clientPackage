I don't know what you did to my king crab legs sea food boil but the sauce was extremely salty to the point where I had to order a different food which was the clams and mussels just to compare if the sauce was really supposed to be like that. When I tasted the cajun sauce of the mussel and clam it was surprisingly fine (better than the cajun sauce of the king crab). I was wondering why this happened but I didn't bother being a Karen because there were too many people and I felt ashamed to even ask seeing how busy it was today. Please look into your salt pouring/measuring because imagine going to sea and drinking the salty water, that is what the sauce tasted like.\nFor having to pay $150 I must say it is not worth it.

The Captain's Boil sauce is soooo finger-licking good (a tad too salty but still yummy nonetheless) and all the seafood we selected were fresh and cooked just nice. Besides the corn being too soggy to our liking, everything else was on point. Obviously the two of us could only manage half of the feast and had to pack the rest home. It's our first time here and we were guided by the nice servers how to order. Will be back for sure.",

The Captain's Boil sauce is soooo finger-licking good (a tad too salty but still yummy nonetheless) and all the seafood we selected were fresh and cooked just nice. Besides the corn being too soggy to our liking, everything else was on point. Obviously the two of us could only manage half of the feast and had to pack the rest home. It's our first time here and we were guided by the nice servers how to order. Will be back for sure.",

When pointed out to management no fix was offered and we paid per crab not by weight.\nAside from that hiccup the service was good, food tasted great and reasonable time to bring out the food.",
