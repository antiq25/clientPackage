And they often lived in smelly cages (pee soaked bedding) and having only pellets (no nutrients) for food. But this Petsmart in North Vancouver provide their rodents with proper size(bigger) and clean wheels to run on, their beddings are clean, and they even give them a variety of fresh vegetables for snacks alongside pellets! I saw happy and healthy  mice exercising on the wheels and comfortably cuddling with each other today. They were so comfortable with humans(thanks to the kind people who take good care of them) they would come out and curiously sniff us. I'm so happy for the animals to be taken such good care of.

The staff were very helpful throughout the adoption process, and the manager (I believe his name was Alex?) went above and beyond. He helped us fill out the paperwork, which because of his help did not feel like a hassle, and he stayed in constant contact throughout the approval and \"take home\" process. He also waited for us to drive back with our lease agreement documents very close to closing time on a Sunday, and for that we are very grateful. They were working with Action for Animals at the time, and their whole adoption process was very straightforward. Although the profile posted for the public did not go into depth regarding the cats' personalities, they did have folders full of information, advice and recommendations for each of the kitties.\nAside from this, we found the store to be clean and organized, but there were dogs inside barking which made the kittens quite jumpy and scared at times. Also, the cat enclosure did not have a climbing or scratching tower (which most PetSmarts do), so we believe that would be a great addition for the kitties enrichment.",

I have been shopping at this store for quite a long time. Last week, I found out a problem at the Main Street  store in North Vancouver. I bought over 20 feeding fishes with my wife and they were on sale. When I paid, a young cashier seems didn't know what kind of fish I bought.  So I told him they were Rosy Red Minnow which was $0.40 each. I also showed him their discount label on my phone.  The discount label said buy 5 save 25% on all fish. The cashier ignored what the label said.  He charged me $0.45 per fish instead of $0.40 per fish.  Then gave me 15% discount but not 25% discount.  Both the charges and discount were not right. My wife told the cashier about the problem and he told us the price he input was correct.  He didn't want to look at my wife and he looked unhappy on what we said from his behavior. Not sure if we are not caucasian. I told my wife to solve the problem later with the Manager. I found the manager and told her about the issue. She made the correction on the charges and gave me the refund. But I forgot to tell her this was not the first time I was charged for the wrong price. I will keep an eye on the receipts as I don't want to overpay if I shouldn't be. Nobody want to lose money on the high value items. Good Luck!",
