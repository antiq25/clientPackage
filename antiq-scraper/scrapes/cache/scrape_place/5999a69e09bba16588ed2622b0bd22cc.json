Like the audacity of this woman/man they/them it. So next time you guys want to buy fish make sure you tell them you have a 100gal aquarium and claim that 14 days return in case they'll die in that time period. I didn't go with the purchase because the no return got me scared now that I know about it lol\n\nPs: there's a dead fish everytime I go there\n\nHere's my tanks by the way",

And then PetSmart turns our dog away (1.5 years old) from a grooming session, as his tetanus shot was two weeks out of date. Never getting our business again. What a joke.",

Very spacious, clean and well arranged, a lot of foods, treats, toys, clothes, accessories, and other stuffs for your pets. As far as I noticed, they cover dogs off course, cats, fish, birds, reptiles, and other small pets (like rabbits, hamster, guinea pigs, even rats and mice). Although I never used their service, but hard to miss that they also have grooming and training facilities. For the clothes, I found not too many choices, but for food and treats they have quite a lot options to choose. Installing their phone apps is worth it, where we can find promotion info, check stock availability, online shop, book appointment for services, etc.\n\nFor Petsmart, keep up the good job!",
