Had to go to washroom first as I have some health issues and needed to wash my hands before I eat. As normally ppl should. Staff didn't want to let me in with an excuse that the maintenance is in progress. No one was doing maintenance they just simply decided to close to the washroom for the night. This kind of behaviour should be illegal as it is a restaurant and restaurant bylaw says clearly you need to provide washroom when ppl eat in. Hope they will not behave like this towards anyone else in the future. Managers name that night was Jenny. Hope the top management will sort this out. I will visit again to see if the behaviour towards customers improved. Then will revisit my review.",

            "review_text": "Absolutely ridiculous behaviour from the staff. It's 9:20pm. I ordered online ahead of time as I was coming in car from home to eat in. Had to go to washroom first as I have some health issues and needed to wash my hands before I eat. As normally ppl should. Staff didn't want to let me in with an excuse that the maintenance is in progress. No one was doing maintenance they just simply decided to close to the washroom for the night. This kind of behaviour should be illegal as it is a restaurant and restaurant bylaw says clearly you need to provide washroom when ppl eat in. Hope they will not behave like this towards anyone else in the future. Managers name that night was Jenny. Hope the top management will sort this out. I will visit again to see if the behaviour towards customers improved. Then will revisit my review.",
