So definitely not going back again.\nOur order or beef samosas came out rotten, and they, in turn, gave us a replacement plate of bhajiyas/pakodas, which they did charge us for.\n\nWe had ordered muttonn korma, and they dished out lamb. I corrected this with them while paying, but nothing was done about it. That\"s two mistakes already in same order.\n\nBiriyani, Nihari and drinks were good.\nServer was good.\n\nAmbience is not that great. Typical south Asian vibes.\nI'd avoid going there.",

I wasn't expecting authentic Pakistani flavors but everything we ordered was perfect and took me straight back home! The Chicken Lahori Karahi was made to perfection with the right level of spice and curry sauce.\nWould like to thank our waiter Awais for recommending us and giving us a delightful evening with a great chat.\n\nWould definitely come here again if ever visiting Vancouver!",
