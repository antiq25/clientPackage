If I eat raw onions I get hives.  When I took it back to the counter, the woman who served me basically said it was my fault because I was talking to my friend when I was ordering.  Im not an idiot, I always ask for no onions.\nI told her that I was not talking to my friend and I specifically said no onions. She then backed off and made me a new burger. Afterwards I saw her whispering to her co-worker.  This is not the first time this has happened and I did the survey before and never got a response.  I will never go back to burger king again and I make sure to tell everyone of the bad service from the restaurant and the head office.\nObviously neither care about customer service, Mcdonalds  is located directly across the street and I will just go there.",
