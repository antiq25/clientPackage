Aside from anywhere up to 36 different beers on tap (as far as I counted), they have a food truck INSIDE the taproom for a quick snack, and their patio is dog friendly. A note though that the neighborhood is questionable so go with a group.",

This brewery should be rated higher,  in my opinion.  We had two flights after trying to pick from the 40 beers (all but cider brewed by them). The flights were great. The spot had plenty of seating and some skinny chicken wings, but don't let that discourage you. The sweet and spicy rub were bomb. Ended up, walking away with a mix pack and the yummy torque IPA. A new must try for our Vancouver trips",

You should know that you must first order your food and drink before sitting down. Food is best ordered to share, even though the portion sizes aren't the biggest, they aren't the smallest either, nor are they the best presented dishes. For a brewery, this place has a decent kitchen, mostly fried offerings.  Where they really excel, is the choice and quality of beer! They definitely have something for every beer lover in terms of flavors. I typically like to sit on their outdoor patio, but the inside of the building is also a great spot to hang out. Overall, if you have a large group of people and want to catch up, this place will seat you almost immediately and will feed everyone, within a reasonable budget.",
