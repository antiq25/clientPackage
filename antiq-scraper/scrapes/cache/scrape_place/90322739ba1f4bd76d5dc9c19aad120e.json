After eating so much along the walk through Robson, it was nice to see a venue offer quick bites to have a taste of their menu!! Pay and order first and then pick up, enjoy at a table for 2 since it's a small restaurant and then clean up your table after and place trays in designated area. Simple and easy. The tako bombs were pretty good but it definitely needed some hot sauce so we bought some for about $0.30Cad not bad but usually it's a free condiment for us. It definitely brought out the flavors! The karage chicken was also a good find! If I had room in my tummy I would have grabbed some spam musubi!! Looked good!!",
