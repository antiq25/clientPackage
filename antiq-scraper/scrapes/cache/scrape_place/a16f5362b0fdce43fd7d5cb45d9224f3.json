After several phone calls, emails, texts it became apparent that they new less than nothing about installing a wall unit or anything else for that matter. Although we were told they were professionals, the installer asked what tools he needed and if we would help him put it up. Not sure, but thought that was what we were paying him for to install and know what tools to bring. It became very obvious that we were gong to be in for a terrible experience so cancelled and started searching for an alternative.\nI found First Lion online and thank you to all that have sent in their experiences and expressed their satisfaction because it was from those reviews that convinced me to go with First Lion. Spoke with Gabriel and was impressed with the very pertinent questions he asked, obviously knew what he was doing.\nMy experience: nothing short of absolute satisfaction. Extremely professional, knowledgeable, polite, hard working, perfect install. I expected to be pleased but was actually amazed. They are the only install company to use, bar none. More costly than Task Rabbit maybe, but worth every penny and more. They said they would arrive at 10am, they arrived at 9:50 and were working by 10. They finished at about 3 and although I asked them to take a break they politely declined and kept working. Gabriel and Brent were just two great hard working guys and deserve to get the kind of reviews that are listed here.\nDo yourself a favour and skip the stress of a poor install and just get First Lion to do it right the first time and sit back and enjoy.\nCan't say enough about them, really, awesome company.",

I wanted to try out his services first as his rates were very reasonable but I didn't know him personally. Let me just say that as a professional real estate agent I have many encounters with handyman/contractors but I am glad I called Gabriel as he was extremely professional, punctual, and knowledgeable with lots of care when it came to transporting my your goods and installation/building of my furniture. I will 100% be using Gabriel and First Lion Express again to get the other 3 suites furnished and have no hesitation in recommending him and his professional services.",

            "review_id": "Gabriel is nothing short of heroic.  He returned my call within minutes, was extremely professional and pleasant, came the same day, and assembled a really heavy, bulky, complicated piece of Ikea furniture in two hours - all by himself when the instructions had said you needed two people.  The hourly rate is the same or lower than the others and without all the hidden fees.  He was so great that when I needed some handyman work done, I called Gabriel without hesitation.  Once again, he was tremendously kind and professional.  I think the second job I gave him was even more difficult than the first yet he did it graciously and with a big smile for a really, really good price.  Gabriel embodies what the tradespeople of a bygone era were like - incredibly service oriented, punctual, professional, completely trustworthy, honest, hard-working, and very highly skilled. As an aside, as a single woman, I am very careful about who I let into my home.  I had no hesitation about Gabriel and in fact when I had to step out for a few minutes he was even thoughtful enough to say \"I'll keep your house safe while you're gone\" .   Hire Gabriel.  He will give you the very best, highest-quality, most professional service for the best price.  He is the real deal.",
