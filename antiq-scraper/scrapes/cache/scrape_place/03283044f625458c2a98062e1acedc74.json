The restaurant gets quite busy during lunch, I would suggest plan accordingly and come after the lunch rush. The restaurant holds about 20 people or less, the ambiance is that of a fish spot with seafood art on the walls. Since this was our first stop in Granville Island and wanted to try and see everything, we decided to share the clam chowder and the infamous fish and Chips! Great customer service, daughter was our server, mother washing dishes very humble people. If you are in a hurry, I wouldn't suggest coming here, everything is made fresh to order so it'll take a min. The food was hot and absolutely delicious, one of the best fish and chips around!",

The restaurant's inviting ambiance and friendly staff immediately set the stage for a memorable dining experience. With a diverse menu boasting a variety of seafood delicacies, our taste buds were in for a treat.\n\nTo start, we ordered the Caesar Salad, and it was a refreshing and well-balanced dish. The crisp romaine lettuce was generously coated in a tangy dressing, complemented by a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and crunchy croutons. It served as an excellent precursor to the seafood feast that awaited us.  I will note a pretty standard caesar salad.\n\nNext up was the Seafood Sampler, a delightful platter brimming with ocean treasures. The array of Seafood Clams, Mussels, Prawns and Scallops with breaded Oysters and deep fried Cod was impeccably fresh and expertly prepared. The sampler was a great way to explore various flavours of the sea in one dish.\n\nThe Clam Chowder was a standout among the starters. Creamy, rich, and generously loaded with tender clams, it warmed our souls and left us craving more. The balance of flavours was spot on, and the hearty portion made it perfect for sharing.\n\nMoving on to the Prawn Appetizer, we were delighted by the succulent prawns cooked to perfection. The dish was accented with a zesty marinade that enhanced the natural sweetness of the prawns. It was an appetizer we couldn't resist finishing entirely, even though we knew we had a main course to savour.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was undoubtedly the Cioppino, a seafood stew packed with an array of fish, mussels, and squid. The broth was a harmonious symphony of tomatoes, garlic, and herbs that danced on our palates with every spoonful. The seafood was tender, indicating the use of fresh catch, and the dish was served piping hot, adding to its comforting appeal. Although it may seem simple, this dish showcased Tony's expertise in crafting seafood classics.\n\nOverall, Tony's Fish & Oyster Cafe earns a solid 4-star rating. The dining experience was enhanced not only by the delectable seafood offerings but also by the warm and attentive service provided by the sever. While some dishes stood out more than others, the restaurant's commitment to quality and flavoursome seafood left a lasting impression on our taste buds. Tony's Fish & Oyster Cafe is a worthy destination to satisfy your cravings.",
