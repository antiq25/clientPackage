The rolls were GREAT sized; in fact perfect. My first bite I actually had an explosion of each independent flavour coming together. It was like in FOOD WARS when the song comes on and someone has a FOODGASM. Both rolls were BOMB BOMB BOMB; so I proceeded to order a SAKE in-line, alongside a Chicken Curry Katsu. Providing a detailed video of each dish; photos of the menu for you to enjoy and the SAKE/Atmosphere. Giving the atmosphere a 5/5 because of the music. Don't miss out on this friends =). If you enjoy your experience and agree drop this review a like for the business  keeping our reviews just, fair and authentic.",
