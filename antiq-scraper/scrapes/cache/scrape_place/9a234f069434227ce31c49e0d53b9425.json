Because she is a designer as well, she gave me a lot of insight on dresses that would look good on my body. While I didn't find my dress this visit with her, she gave me a lot of pointers on what to look for in the future.\n\nAlso the dresses she designs herself are just gorgeous, definitely visit this spot (very boho/New York fashion week!)!

I also loved that I was able to get the dress in a colour that was verging on cream -- I have never felt really good wearing white or even ivory. And it matched the day and my husband's suit perfectly. Pro tip: Because if the train, the Athena works really well if you get married on a windy day.",

This experience was a million times better than buying from a large store where you never get to meet the actual designer and creator of your wedding dress. This whole process was so much fun and the dress is even better than what I imagined! If I could give you more stars I would - thank you Hrissa!",

Although professional, Hrissa is not precious with her designs and truly works with the wearer to tailor the dress to fit the married vision of the designer and the wearer. She's open to requests for custom tweaks, and makes recommendations when the need to be lead is evidenced.\n\nIf you're looking for a romantic dress and experience, Elika In Love is the perfect studio to do so.
