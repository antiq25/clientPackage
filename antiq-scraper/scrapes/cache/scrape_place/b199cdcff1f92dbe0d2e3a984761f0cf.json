In a pinch, you could come in and pick up dry pasta, fresh fruits and veg , and of course seafood.\n\nI normally come here in the summer for salmon and when the time is right spot prawns and they don't disappoint.\n\nA lot of traffic (as you can see from the other posts) are mostly commenting on fish and chips and their other cooked food. Again, it's just a portion of what they do.\n\nThe fish and chips are solid and the batter is not too thick. Got takeout and ate it 20 minutes later and was still crispy. Recommend calling the order in , especially if it's getting close to lunch time as there is a high school close by and it can get crowded. People talk about the fries and they are good. For value and quantity, it definitely hits the spot. Also tried the curries eggplant halibut wrap. It was good. Maybe a bit mild for my tastes but for those wanting that light curry flavour with their fish, this would work for you.\n\nParking in the complex , with the highschool crowd etc...can be a bit of a slog depending on the time. Though I find the best and easiest place to park is on the street.",

The fish and chips dinner is enough for teo people. I will visit this place again for trying the other fish cuisines.",
