Average wait time to get someone to answer the phone - none.  (I'm not even going to tell you what the other places were like - and another nameless equipment place asked me to do something illegal - seriously).  Steelhead is either able to remote in or walk us through a problem in about 10-15 minutes or they have someone onsite in about 4 hours, which is critical in tax time.  One time with one of the competitors we had to buy a small printer from Staples because they were going to be days to fix a problem.  Days.  In tax season.  Really!  My office manager has just told me we're never switching because she can at least talk with a person at Steelhead.  They have been patient with us and we so appreciate that we aren't a big customer, but they don't treat us like a small one.",
