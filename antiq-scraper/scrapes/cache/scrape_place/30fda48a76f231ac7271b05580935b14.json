Despite this not being a standard menu item, Connie, who provided impeccable service, went above and beyond to convey my requests to Johnny. Without hesitation, they not only fulfilled but also surpassed all my culinary expectations.\n\nHaving worked in the restaurant industry during my young adulthood and even having had an 8-year connection to a Greek family, my standards are exceptionally high. The chicken was impeccably moist and flavorful, while the spanakopita boasted a perfectly flaky exterior with a delectably moist and delicious filling. I requested a little extra tzatziki, and Connie promptly delivered it with a welcoming smile.\n\nIn summary, my dining experience at Johnny's on Oak was nothing short of delectable, and I left thoroughly satisfied. The combination of superb food, exceptional service, and the willingness to accommodate unique requests truly made this visit unforgettable.",
