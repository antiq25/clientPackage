I immediately knew that this is the worst McDonald's restaurant I have ever entered. All of the workers from taking my order to serving my food were basically asleep. Which was anticipated looming from this sleepy town. The restaurant was packed with annoying homeless people that made me lose my appetite. The manager did nothing about the situation which was odd? One of the employees told me that it was normal, and that they have no contact with the mall security. However, the arrival of a Ukrainian family changed the catastrophic atmosphere in an unexpected and wonderful way. Made me feel as if I was in a clean restaurant in Europe. I would recommend heading down to the McBride Mcdonald's, where the workers can be seen cleaning and enjoying themselves unlike this location... Do not satisfy this business with your well-earned money!",
