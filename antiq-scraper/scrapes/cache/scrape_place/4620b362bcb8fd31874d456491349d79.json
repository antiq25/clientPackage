And I just came here for brunch, so I should write about my eating experience here.\n\nAll the food and presentation looked great! If you see photos of the bento boxes here, I would be drooling and looking forward to eating the food again. Each item was cooked and presented well. No doubt about it. One thing that I would like the restaurant to be improved on was the temperature of the food. I believe most of the food was cooked ahead of time, so when we placed an order, the chef or staff at the kitchen would put them nicely in a bento box, so everything looked great but the food was not hot at all. The rice, miso soup, and everything else were at room temperature. It will be greatly appreciated if the food is cooked and hot right out of the stove or oven.\n\nThe restaurant is on the rooftop of a low rise building. My family and I walked stairs and it's quite a lot of stairs to get to the restaurant. If someone who can't walk on stairs or who is on a wheelchair, you might have to look around and see if they have an elevator to go up to the top floor.\n\nIt is a great place to meet with friends or family and enjoy a special meal here. There is a parkade next to the building or people take public transit and walk to the restaurant.",

We usually don't make food ahead unless you pre-ordered and hot items are supposed to be hot even if you preordered. There must be something wrong happening and we apologize that we served lukewarm food to you. We will find and fix the error to serve you better on your next visit. \n\nWe have elevators next to the building, the same as the parkade. You might need to ask the concierge to get up to the restaurant since it is a little hard to find the way to reach the restaurant.\n\nThank you very much for the heads-up for our food quality and we look forward to serving you soon.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nYasuaki",
