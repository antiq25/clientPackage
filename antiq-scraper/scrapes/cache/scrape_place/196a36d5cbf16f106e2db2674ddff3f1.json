We asked for crushed peanuts for our papaya salad and they gave us a mere half a teaspoon.\nThe other times we ate here before, they have served peanuts with the papaya salad, which is how we prefer it. We would be ok if get charged extra for this too.\nOur friend also ordered Thai coffee which came with ice and we asked if we could get another one but with no ice, and they said no  For this reason, I'm rating their service a 3/5 despite their politeness.\nBut I'd go back for the food in a heartbeat!",

We asked for crushed peanuts for our papaya salad and they gave us a mere half a teaspoon.\nThe other times we ate here before, they have served peanuts with the papaya salad, which is how we prefer it. We would be ok if get charged extra for this too.\nOur friend also ordered Thai coffee which came with ice and we asked if we could get another one but with no ice, and they said no  For this reason, I'm rating their service a 3/5 despite their politeness.\nBut I'd go back for the food in a heartbeat!",

We would like to explain what happened.\n\nThe first is peanuts. You all ordered papaya salad. And your boyfriend has asked for peanuts for it but in the recipe we don't have it on the menu. which we have given You go for a small cup of peanuts. and you have asked for more which we have refused Because it is something that is not in the recipe. 2. For iced coffee The shop is sure that we can make iced coffee without ice. But that day you asked us to make hot coffee for you. It wasn't on the menu so we declined. However, I think there has been a misunderstanding in this communication. and the shop would like to inform you that In fact, the shop has announced that they will do take out only from September 5th. Thank you very much.",

I'd definitely recommend both dishes, though if I had to pick a must-try item, it'd be the Chuchi Pla Tod for sure.\n\nThe place is small with little seating and an open kitchen. I came in the summer and there wasn't much foot traffic, so sitting outside was actually enjoyable. The waitress came out to check in on us quite often (most of their customers seem to sit outside) and refilled our water frequently.\n\nIt's about $25-$35 per person, which is on the higher end of price, but was so worth it for the food, quantity was decent too. I would definitely recommend and will be back myself to show this place to other friends.",
