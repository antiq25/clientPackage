A person was actually playing on her phone standing in front of the coffee station. So I guess there was one guy assigned to make the coffee and he was off doing something and needing to get scissors and going back but NO ONE even thought of trying to speed things along by making the coffee. They didn't look like trainees because no one was learning anything. There was a manager on site too! Plus other people in the back and a person sweeping up out front, and yet, no sign of a thought that they could help while there were only a couple of people waiting. Normally it's quite slow to get an order there later in the day but I always figured it was because they were overwhelmed with people and you can see many customers standing around (and at least they are trying and working hard), but in this case, they were not busy. So since no one had started to get the coffee yet, I asked politely if I could get the coffee in my own travel mug please. She answered yes, but with a derisive expression and tone but then didn't take the cup. So found out she was going to pour it in from their disposable cup after and that they don't charge for the cup there (which doesn't matter to me). The other McDonald's I go to has already put up a corporate sign encouraging using your own cup, so I know that while there is a Covid concern, as a company they have already made this change and McDonald's has produced this sign at least a month ago. Anyhow, I said that pouring it in defeats the purpose of trying to reduce waste, so she did bring it over to the area but did not explain it to the ONE GUY that apparently can pour coffee in the place and they still wasted a cup and to really rub it in, he opened up a straw in front of me to stir with completely unnecessarily when they knew I was concerned with waste because I had that conversation with that other woman and she completely couldn't be bothered to pass it on or look after the fact that I had made the request to use my cup directly (no one else was waiting in line). Also, when I told him not to (when I saw him open up the straw package), he continued moving to put it in the coffee even though I was CLEARLY saying no and then I had to really emphasize it, because he just wouldn't stop! SUCH AN UNPLEASANT experience. I am flabbergasted by the lack of any motivation to be competent by this crew. I understand division of labour but this was a huge failure. The other McDonald's that is encouraging travel mugs also gets the entire order done before I even get over to the counter and is friendly and normal, not rude and full of attitude on arrival. At the very least, try to be friendly when you greet someone, especially when they are friendly and happy in the first place, and especially when it was not busy at all! Submitted in the spirit of trying to help because if no one ever said anything, this place would keep having problems.",
