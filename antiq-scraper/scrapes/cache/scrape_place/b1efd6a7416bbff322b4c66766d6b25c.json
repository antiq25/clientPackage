The only criticism I'd give was the room was marketed as \"top floor city view\" and my window literally looked out onto the roof. Not much of a city view however the room itself was quite nice. Lots of great amenities near by including a very large shopping mall and the metro station.",

The staff were really friendly and my wife and I were able to get everything we needed in walking distance. I just wish breakfast was until 11. We are a young couple so we like to sleep in a little bit while on vacation. The breakfast quality was not bad. A little bit overcooked but still enjoyable. The room was very comfortable. We also loved the fact that the rooms walls were soundproofed ;). We will definately be back again.",

However, there were issues with our thermostat that did not get resolved before we left. Ended up just turning it off. I had a hard time falling asleep in the hot room. Cleaner threw out collectable empty beer bottles I was saving as souvenirs (I get they didn't know but it was a serious bummer).",
