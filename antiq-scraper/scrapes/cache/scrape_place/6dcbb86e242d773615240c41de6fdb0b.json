Every time we go to Vancouver we make sure we stop by the Rodney oyster's house in Yaletown.\nFrom fresh oysters to one of the best service I've had in a restaurant, this is definitely a place you need to try.\nEvery single plate was perfect and came super fast, we got the crab cakes, garlic shrimps, shrimp cocktail, clams, mussels and obviously oysters. Everything was so fresh and the oysters come with a lot of different choices of sauces for you to choose from.\nVery clean restaurant and very cute ambiance for a date, a dinner with friends or even to just go by yourself !\nThe staff working there has one of the best service I've seen in years, they are really on point and so friendly and nice, this is one of the reasons we always go back there, we just love the ambiance and service so much, a lot of place should take exemple of this place !\nWe've been served by Mackenzie and sadly I don't forget the name of the other employees that took care of us but it isn't the last time they will see us in the establishment!\nIF YOU LOVE SEAFOOD AND GOOD VIBES YOU NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE !",

Great food and service, a fun place to be in, top class all around.\n\nWe found that it is important to reserve a table, even in the middle of the week (it was summer, too, so that might add a bit).\n\nThe waiter was great, the hot sauce defection was wonderful, and the choices in oyster types was unexpected and fantastic to have. We dove right in, so if you see the picture I took you can tell that a lot of the oysters had already been eaten by the time I got my camera out.\n\nYou know, you go away from raw oysters for a while and you start thinking, \"I'm kind of ok without them,\" or \"Did I really eat those things?\" But then you get taken to Rodney's and you relearn that oysters are amazing things to eat.",
