The service is okay in the drive through but curbside or dining in is extremely slow. The washrooms are utterly disgusting. None of the doors lock, there's only one hand dryer and it doesn't work half the time. Last time I was there one of the toilets didn't have a toilet seat! Oh and this place is definitely not 24/7, they close for about 20 minutes early in the morning so if you're running late for work you're going to be SOL if you stop here.",
