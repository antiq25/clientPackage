The food was delicious, the portions were generous, and the restaurant was more than happy to accommodate a few of our guests who had dietary restrictions. The service was fast, and the communication with us was incredible. So many of our guests also complimented the excellent service they received during our reception, and we had so many compliments about the beautiful view of Vancouver as well. The servers even went out of their way to ensure that we, the bride and groom, were comfortable and well taken care of during the entire brunch. Even the preplanning was smooth and seamless, and communicating back and forth with Makda about wedding details was an easy process. Many of our guests have commented that this was one of the best weddings they've been to, and we could not have done it without all the wonderful help provided by Seasons. As a wedding venue, we highly recommend Seasons in the Park! Plus, we felt compared to other wedding venues, that Seasons was quite reasonable, and who can beat that beautiful view of Vancouver, and wonderful setting within Queen Elizabeth Park. Thank you very much Seasons for making our special day so wonderful!",

They were really communicative and amazing!\n\nI loved their cocktails, their bread, the Caesar salad and their desserts. The main courses however were things you could find at any other restaurant with the same taste.\n\nThe view was outstanding, and you could see the city along with the Queen Elizabeth park. They have heaters in the patio section along with blankets. The restaurant seemed catered to older persons.\n\nMain meals were priced at $20-$40.",
