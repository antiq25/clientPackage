They have no paper dispenser. Therefore the staff are probably picking up a collection of germs and bringing it to the kitchen.  I politely brought this to attention of the manager named Cameron B.  He was abrupt, dismissive and rash to the point of being discourteous. I'm at least double his age.  He kept repeating over my concerns: \"This has nothing to do with us\".  There are $20 foot pulls that they can install to allow customers and staff to open the door without touching the handles.",

She is the assistant manager but don't know how to behave with the customers. Very disappointing service. The senior managers should take care of that. She even told me that I should move that their is a line up instead of changing my food. How can a manager be like that?..",
