A few times I've refilled my prescription ahead of time only to arrive and find it's not ready or the medication is not available, yet no one bothered to contact me. One time I was told to return in 45 min which I did after waking around the store to be told my medication wasn't in stock yet no one bothered to call me.

I called my doctor and explained the situation, he said that I absolutely shouldn't experiment and see if I get sick or not. He called the pharmacy and changed the prescription.  I had to wait another hour for the new prescription to be ready (of course they didn't take back the first one), but the best part was when my wife told them that their service is poor she got the answer, \"then don't come here\". We certainly will take their advice and NEVER shop there again.",

A lot of the problems at the North Vancouver Superstore Pharmacy can be placed squarely on the shoulders of the management team.

Without good customer service, who one cares if this store can get the right pills in a container (any pharmacy can do this).\n\nPharmacy improvements could include: improvements to workplace culture thereby improving the satisfaction of the workers which in turn trickles down to the customers, friendliness, having Rxs ready when the pharmacy say they will be ready, fulling Rxs faxed in by physicians offices, calling customer/doctor to clarify (instead of waiting until the customer shows up) thereby forcing the customer to wait another 30 mins, calling the customer when the Prescription cant be filled.\n\nI've moved my family to a much better pharmacy where we get much better care.",

A lot of the problems at the North Vancouver Superstore Pharmacy can be placed squarely on the shoulders of the management team. Putting consumer needs first, need to be a key element of the workplace culture. Without good customer service, who one cares if this store can get the right pills in a container (any pharmacy can do this).\n\nPharmacy improvements could include: improvements to workplace culture thereby improving the satisfaction of the workers which in turn trickles down to the customers, friendliness, having Rxs ready when the pharmacy say they will be ready, fulling Rxs faxed in by physicians offices, calling customer/doctor to clarify (instead of waiting until the customer shows up) thereby forcing the customer to wait another 30 mins, calling the customer when the Prescription cant be filled.\n\nI've moved my family to a much better pharmacy where we get much better care.",
