I spent a good amount of time wandering the aisles, hoping someone would notice my evident need for assistance. The absence of responsiveness was astounding, especially for a retail establishment of Canadian Tire's reputation.\n\nTaking the initiative, I approached multiple staff members to voice my concerns and hopefully get the assistance I needed. To my shock, instead of being met with understanding or an apology, one of the employees sharply retorted, \"Dude! What's your problem? I'm busy here!\" This response was not only unprofessional but also an outright dismissal of a customer's genuine concerns.\n\nThe experience left a sour taste in my mouth. It's unfortunate to see such a decline in customer service, especially in a place like Canadian Tire, which has always been a go-to for many Canadians. I had always held the store in high regard, but this incident has made me reconsider future visits.\n\nWhile everyone can have a bad day, the blatant disregard and subsequent rudeness were beyond justifiable. Customers deserve respect and attentive service, especially in an establishment as renowned as Canadian Tire. It's my sincere hope that the management addresses this issue, as no customer should ever leave feeling belittled or dismissed.",

            "review_text": "I recently made a trip to Canadian Tire, expecting the typical courteous Canadian shopping experience. To my dismay, the staff were notably rude and indifferent. I spent a good amount of time wandering the aisles, hoping someone would notice my evident need for assistance. The absence of responsiveness was astounding, especially for a retail establishment of Canadian Tire's reputation.\n\nTaking the initiative, I approached multiple staff members to voice my concerns and hopefully get the assistance I needed. To my shock, instead of being met with understanding or an apology, one of the employees sharply retorted, \"Dude! What's your problem? I'm busy here!\" This response was not only unprofessional but also an outright dismissal of a customer's genuine concerns.\n\nThe experience left a sour taste in my mouth. It's unfortunate to see such a decline in customer service, especially in a place like Canadian Tire, which has always been a go-to for many Canadians. I had always held the store in high regard, but this incident has made me reconsider future visits.\n\nWhile everyone can have a bad day, the blatant disregard and subsequent rudeness were beyond justifiable. Customers deserve respect and attentive service, especially in an establishment as renowned as Canadian Tire. It's my sincere hope that the management addresses this issue, as no customer should ever leave feeling belittled or dismissed.",
