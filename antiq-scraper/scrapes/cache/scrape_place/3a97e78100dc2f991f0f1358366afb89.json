We realized afterward that she didn't even ask if we wanted drinks. I had asked for no onions in my wrap (she wasn't writing down our order, just to be clear), and when my food arrived, surprise - there were onions. Told our server who took it away and brought it back a minute later. Obviously, they just hand-picked the onions out and yet still managed to leave some behind so I had to go digging around pulling out the bits that were left. At no point did she ask how our food was, at no point did she ask if we wanted anything else, or even ask about dessert after we finished eating. The tzatziki in my wrap was delicious, the fries were good, but the lamb was in big chunks and chewy/fatty. We were brought a glass Ketchup bottle with no lid (not sure why it had no lid), meaning we couldn't shake the bottle before pouring some out, so we got the unpleasant watery Ketchup all over one of our plates. Prices were decent however.\nThe icing on the cake - when she brought us our bill, she must've cut herself because there was blood on it.",
