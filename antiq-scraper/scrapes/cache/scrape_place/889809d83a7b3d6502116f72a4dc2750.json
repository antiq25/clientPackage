After close to 40 minutes waiting for my 2 meals with 2 fries no salt, end up I got salt all over my hand and the food I got was cold.  Asked to change the hot fries with no salt and complained I had been waiting for my food over 30 mins.  The manager gave an attitude, \"it is not my problem, we were busy\", I said \"so is that my problem? you are the manager on duty and not responsible the human power?\"  She turned around and shout \"it's not my problem, give her something hot\".  I am patience enough to wait more than 30 mins for FAST FOOD and I deserve to receive this kind of \"Customer service\"????  The manager was trying to hide when I was taking her picture for evidence.  And other manager on duty was trying to cover her and asked me am I using human right.  There is nothing to do with human right but I was not treated right.  I brought it up to McDonald Headquarter about the incident I experienced at this location and asked for refund coz I threw them away.  The headquarter told me this restaurant manager would contact me within 10 business days but I never receive any phone call or email.  I received 2 meal coupons from Headquarter as a refund.  I will never ever come back again.  P.S. This restaurant is always full of garbage everywhere and no one was doing cleaning.",
