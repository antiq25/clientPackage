I signed up for a trial pass after a few months off from my cancellation at another gym. When I came in, a younger male was helping me to activate the trial. I had received a text message saying the 7 day pass was no longer offered but a one day was available to claim. I decided to pass on the trial I booked in for and perhaps go another time. A few days later I got a text message offering a 7 day trial so my assumption that they were offering it to me since I wasn't coming in. The younger male at the front kept going back and forth and reading and explaining the text messages to me, not even doing anything to resolve or find a solution. Honestly, if he is looking to be a position of management in the future, making sure your guests are happy and feel taken cared for is the number one thing. The gym is a personal and intimate space and I was not happy with someone like that handling my account. He kept going back and forth and I literally said to him \"honestly this is not my problem, what can we do about it\". I told him either way a 1 day or a 7 day I'll take since I was already there. If it wasn't for Von I wouldn't even consider going to this location. Focus on learning conflict resolution instead of focusing on the problem and repeating it to the client thinking that it is the answer and will resolve it lol. Don't really need a male younger than me speaking to me like that but I'm patient enough to give people space to grow and learn, literally not my responsibility. The location is clean and quiet, I went around 2-3pm. They have a bag for Muay Thai\n\n\"I see we need to update our messaging system, I will check if we can honour the seven days but in the case we can't, is the one day trial for today okay with you?\"",

When I visited AF, staffs helped me out for the transition and this place is so nice and chill. I didn't have to wait for an equipment at all so that's a win for me. Great location, friendly members, no horse plays, grunting, dropping weights, competitive pricing and friendly staffs. 10/10 would recommend.",

Either you want it hard or challenging or easy just by doing single consultation with him. Also they do have lockers that you don't need to bring your personal keys.",
