I couldn't pass and I agree with the previous customers and enjoyed the service and the food itself. The gentlemen at the cashier was very friendly by greeting me in Thai - it's appreciated.\n\nI ordered the Pad Thai and it was delicious. It had the perfect spice to it and the spring roll was just right. I loved the soup that came with it as it washed down the after taste. Next time I will try their soup and I will come by soon!

Especially this little hidden gem.\n\nWe had:\n\nPad Thai Combo ($14.99 + $2 for choosing prawns) - one of the best I've had, the flavour was a perfect balance of slightly sweet, savoury and a little kick of spice (you can adjust). The combo comes with the following: (1) a salad, (2) a spring roll, (3) a soup, and (4) your choice of a drink. The soup was clean and clear but packed with flavour. It was a clear sign that the chef is talented\n\nTom Kah Goong (Prawn) ($14.95) - this is very reminiscent of the more popular Tom Yum soup but with the addition of creamy coconut milk. It was piping hot (seriously, be careful!) but I fought through the pain to gulp it down because it was so delicious! Those hot, sour, creamy flavours all melded together into an amazing concoction. Bites of mushroom, lemongrass, tomatoes, onions, and prawns throughout were delightful\n\nThe fact that you're getting this level of restaurant-quality (and honestly much better than some restaurants) food in a little place like this is unbelievable. They're the sweetest and they obviously pour so much love into what they do. If you're ever in the area, I hope you'll consider stopping by this hidden food court!
