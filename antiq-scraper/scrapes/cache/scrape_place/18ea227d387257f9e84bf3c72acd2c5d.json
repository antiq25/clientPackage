There were 3 people working there and none of them were wearing masks. Their masks were on their chains and necks. When I asked them to wear their masks at least while they are preparing meals, they didn't pay attention at all. I'm sorry for burger king at 6th street because of such an unprofessional staffs. I never come back at all.",
