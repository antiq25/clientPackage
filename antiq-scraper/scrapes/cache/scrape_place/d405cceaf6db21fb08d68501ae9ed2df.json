The little mini mall has a busy parking lot but you can usually find street parking (both free and paid).\n\nWe've been here a few times to grab a quick bbq lunch combo. But we finally visited for dine-in recently. In addition to their bbq service, they have a full Chinese seafood menu offering.\n\nWe ordered the 3 item bbq combo (you pick and choose which bbq items you want but we opted for the roast pork, bbq, and soya sauce chicken). While the bbq price is higher than the lunch combos, you get more meat. Not a bad price when you consider how much the price of bbq duck has gone up lately. The duck was good... meaty and juicy. Roast pork has nice crispy skin. A welcome addition to the area for bbq.\n\nPea tips were good too. And I like that we received complimentary soup to start and green bean soup for dessert.\n\nReally want to come back here and try some of their seafood combos.\n\nUpdate: We did return in October to try a dinner combo with a 2lb lobster sticky rice with 2 bbq items plus 1 other dish for $118 (we picked the sole fillets with veggies). We also added the Taiwanese cauliflower with lap cheung and bacon. Again, you get complimentary soup and dessert. Bbq items were as good as before.",

We asked for hot n sour, but the server brought the daily soup instead. When asked why, she then said the combo soup has to be daily soup.\n\nI found the BBQ pork and duck very tasty and not too oily. The green beans w minced pork were perfectly crispy but not too deep-fried. Again, very tasty. Didn't care for the daily soup, as it's just a thin broth w few veggies + few pieces of meat. Would have preferred the hot n sour \n\nFinal bill w tax was just under $60.",
