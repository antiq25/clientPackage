Prescriptions rarely ready on time (even when phoned in days in advance), always a long, slow line up, and there's no care for privacy. All of my medications were laid out directly in front of another customer today because only one of the 2 tills actually has a debit machine (so much for medical confidentiality). It was the last straw for me - I will never fill another prescription here again.",

Poor customer service.\n\nOrdered 3 months worth of medication and at least 3 weeks worth of the med they gave expires next week ... seriously?!?! I went back to get it changed and they did but all that trouble just because some staff didn't do their job!\n\nCheck their white lab gowns - the one that pharmacists and staff should wear during their work hours - it seems they don't wash them and staff just takes turn taking them out of their closet to wear without even looking if its clean or not.  Try looking at it when you are paying or submitting your Rx, seems like the last time it has seen the washing machine was eons ago or has it even seen one?",
