Not much of a view but the cool vibe, smooth fixtures and furniture and chilled sound track more than made up for this. Our drink quickly turned into a meal and several drinks. The food was excellent and not as pricey as the surroundings would lead you to believe. The waiting staff were as alert and attentive than any that I have encountered. A lush experience. I fully recommend a visit.",

For cocktails we got the sangria and Prosecco.\n\nThe Wagyu beef carpaccio was lacking in beef flavour. It was cut a little too thin for me to pick up (just a snag). The tuna tartare was not bad. Very fresh tasting and I liked the addition of the pineapple. The chip went perfectly with the tuna tartare. The oysters were pretty standard. The sangria was delicious as usual.\n\nOverall for happy hour they have a pretty big menu compared to other restaurants. They have a wide variety and the portions are pretty big. The service was super friendly and helpful when it comes to making decisions on the menu. This is the place to be if you are looking for a snack and drinks with friends and a nice location but not for food",
