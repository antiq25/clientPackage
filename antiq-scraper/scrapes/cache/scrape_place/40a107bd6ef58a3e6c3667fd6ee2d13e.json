Having paid $60 in tickets per person, I was genuinely looking forward to an enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met. The event suffered from evident understaffing, leading to a noticeable decline in service quality and notable delays in food service. Despite the event being scheduled to conclude at 2pm, my group and I were still waiting for our food at 1:50pm. Both the event and restaurant staff exhibited an unhelpful and dismissive demeanor when we voiced our concerns.\n\nAdditionally, I observed a lack of attention to cleanliness at the venue, which further compounded the disappointment. A regrettable incident involved the restaurant staff placing all utensils in the middle of the table for communal use, raising significant sanitation issues.\n\nOf particular concern was the inconsistency in food service, where some attendees had already finished their meals while others were left without food even as the event neared its scheduled end at 2pm. This uneven distribution greatly overshadowed the overall experience.",
