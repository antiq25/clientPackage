They showed up about 20 minutes early for our first trip, and showed up an hour and fifteen minutes early for our second! They waited for us both times. No need to worry about missing a connection with that kind of promptness. We had the same driver for both trips, Rey, and he was courteous, friendly, and professional. I was very impressed with Ritz Limousines. Would definitely use again!",
