The staff were incredibly kind and lovely, and I really appreciated how much of an effort they put in to create a cozy dining experience. I sat at the bar and was well attended to, bartender & server all very warm and friendly. They consider the little things in both the service and food. Highly recommended and added to my favorite food list for a revisit.",

Everything we could ask for in service.\n\nThe only gripe I had, and it is indeed a small one is that the restaurant was way too dark. Walking out to the street after dinner we were dazzled by the brightness of the Vancouver lampposts.",
