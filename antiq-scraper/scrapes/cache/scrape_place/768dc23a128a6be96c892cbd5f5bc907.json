The male staff member at the counter even seemed to go over and above, calling a cross-city Mark's to check if that store had an item which a customer wanted.  When it came my turn, he thanked me for my patience and assured me he'd get me moving soon.  I liked that.  I was happy as well with the money I saved today.  $20 bucks off a pair of non-slip Sketchers for the workplace, plus an additional $8 off for joining Mark's online community (they send you a coupon)... basically left the store paying $75 tax included for a pretty decent pair of work shoes, normally $99 plus tax.   All in all, well worth the trip to Kingsgate Mall!",
