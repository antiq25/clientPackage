They only do Cash which is very very annoying as you have to run bring cash and come back, they don't speak a single word in English so it's very very hard to communicate with them we had to translate through Google and show them what we needed at some point.  The lady that works here is very sweet, and she tries, but the males are very rude, and they yell a lot. My friend went to bring cash before we knew the total price so we were short of 50$ and said we will go bring more hold on but the guy started screaming in Chinese and just dropped some of the stuff we brought back to the tanks and kept only the food we had the cash for at the moment (our order was 200$, for this amount i expect a better treatment at least! Plus, we were about to go bring more cash!!) But they didn't understand us. We didn't understand them it's just a mess! I was annoyed that i couldn't get the rest of the stuff i wanted, and after that , I was not willing to go bring more money and spend it here! Also, if a Chinese customer comes even after you, they get to pass you and pay first even if you're standing there first, so just expect that.",
