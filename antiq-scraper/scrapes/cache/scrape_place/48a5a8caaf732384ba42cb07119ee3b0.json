I hesitated a bit but finished it carefully because I and my friends were in a nice conversation so I didn't want to be disrupted. When I reminded the waitress this issue, she was like 'oh I didn't see this when I brought it.' I was filled with question marks in my head because it's not possible to miss it.\n\nTo start with, we ordered the oysters  that we were excited about. TBH, they did not taste too fresh to me, but my friend thinks that it's not bad. However, we both agreed that the oysters are very small, like smaller than the spoon  for them.\nWe also ordered the seafood tower, another thing that we are excited about. It looks great and tastes great as well. But all items are significantly smaller than other places.\n\nAdditionally, a dish with tuna came with a piece of dirty plastic wrap mixed in it. it's really gross. But when we told the waitress, she took it away immediately. She came back in a few mins and said 'okay, we took it out of your bill.' and left. We feel like she did not take food safety seriously and is very used to this issue.\n\nWe felt unsafe to eat more at this moment.\n\nIt was too late to go somwhere else, so we stayed but drank only water from this point. In the end of the day, we spent almost $200 for three people and I ended up heating my leftover when got home.\n\nVery embarrassed from inviting my friend came all the way to North Van for a night like this.\n\nIn sum, for the taste and the drinks, it's quite good.

We have not encountered any issues regarding its proximity to the road, and the safety and comfort of our guests are our top priorities.\n\nRegarding the plastic wrap found in your tuna dish, we take full responsibility for the oversight on our part, and we deeply apologize for any discomfort caused. Furthermore, we would like to clarify that the plastic wrap was not dirty but rather the protective wrap we use to wrap the tuna before cutting it. However, we understand that it should not have been present in the final dish, and we removed it from your bill upon notification.\n\nThe immediate action taken by our server reflects our commitment to addressing any issues promptly. We regret if her response left you with the impression that food safety was not taken seriously. Rest assured, we continuously train our staff to uphold the highest standards of food safety, and incidents like this are not common in our restaurant.\n\nRegarding the oysters, we typically offer smaller-sized oysters as they are favored by many of our regular patrons. However, we also have a premium option available, and the size of the oysters can vary depending on our supplier.\n\nLastly, the seafood towel you ordered was advertised as a towel for two people to share, and we understand that it may not have seemed enough to share between the three of you.\n\nThank you for acknowledging the good taste and drinks at our restaurant. We strive to maintain the quality of our offerings while continuously improving our food quality and safety measures to provide an exceptional dining experience.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback, and we will use it to make the necessary improvements.",

We had the soup of the day which was a lovely mix of sweet potatoes, pear and spinach ... then our calamari starter which was so fresh and crispy served with a lemon wedge and hot sauce.  For our mains we ordered the Salmon Wellington and Paella both of which were a hit and we really enjoyed the complexity of flavours and textures.  Our server was knowledgeable and attentive.  However we felt quite rushed at the end by another staff who might have been our hostess when we first walked in.  She wanted to take our plates away and waited while I finished my last bite!\nWould definitely recommend this place for a nice evening of dining out.

            "review_text": "Great evening at this local seafood gem.  We had the soup of the day which was a lovely mix of sweet potatoes, pear and spinach ... then our calamari starter which was so fresh and crispy served with a lemon wedge and hot sauce.  For our mains we ordered the Salmon Wellington and Paella both of which were a hit and we really enjoyed the complexity of flavours and textures.  Our server was knowledgeable and attentive.  However we felt quite rushed at the end by another staff who might have been our hostess when we first walked in.  She wanted to take our plates away and waited while I finished my last bite!\nWould definitely recommend this place for a nice evening of dining out.  A great location and buzzing with life atmosphere and dim lighting ... some live jazz music would have made it a perfect evening.",
