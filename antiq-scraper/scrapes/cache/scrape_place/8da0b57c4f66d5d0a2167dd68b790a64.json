Fries were perfectly crunchy.\n\nI love the cozy environment and the window seat is great for eating and people watching. I will definitely be back.  Highly recommend.",

Top class fresh oysters, usually 6-7 varieties to choose from.\nThe raw shucked are outstanding - the shucker is a master. We had 2 dozen raw and each was a work of shucking art - each oyster perfectly separated from its shell, undamaged in any way. And with the liquor intact. That is some skill. Hat's off! Oh, and the homemade chili-vodka condiment? Inspired!\n\nThe fried oysters were big meaty west coasters, perfectly crispy, juicy.\n\nI want to go back with a bigger group, so we can try them all.\nBig thanks to the owners - such nice people",
