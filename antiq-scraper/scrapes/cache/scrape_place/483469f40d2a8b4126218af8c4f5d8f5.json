The interior is pretty basic and nothing to write home about, but the food was delicious and service quick. I got the halibut which was fried to perfection - crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside. The fries and coleslaw were also fantastic though I would've liked a bit more slaw because it was so good. Husband got the regular fish (we're assuming cod) which was also delicious and cheaper than halibut. He got the chowder with his combo which lacked salt but was an easy fix and would be good for those trying to be mindful of their salt intake. We were the only customers for a while on a Tuesday at lunch so you wouldn't have to wait long if you're in a rush. We will definitely be back!",

I can see that they are so caring of customers. Everything was great, but the greatest one was seafood soup. I was really craving for a cream soup, and I was fully satisfied with this soup. The French fries were ordinary though. The black coffee was instant one but it was only $1.5, so I liked it. I will visit again for sure !!!",
