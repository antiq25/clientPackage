That vacuum broke in summer, I brought it to the shop first they looked at me like I shouldn't have brought the vacuum for repairs. They took the vacuum from me and I was told it can take 2-4 weeks. Now it's been over 3 months without any answer. Every time I call they have different answer and assure me that they will call me back with update, which never happens. If this is because of corporate or extended warranty company then shame on them to put your staff and paying customers through this much hassle. I had to buy another vacuum because of this. Absolutely terrible service.",

While we were there we saw that you had a better deal for the Frame TV 65 inch that we purchased the day before from Bestbuy.  It wasn't too much of a difference in price but the service was definitely different.  He explained more details about the TV and told us why we should buy the warranty.  I told him that we didn't buy the warranty at Best Buy because they didn't really have anyone that's was experienced enough to sell me the warranty other than telling me what the price was.  So with that said he spent the time with us gave us all the benefits about the TV and explained to us that if we bought the 5 year warranty and didn't use the warranty in 5 years that we would get a store credit to buy anything we wanted in the store. This definitely was a great selling feature and after that experience we bought the TV with the warranty from Rhythm and told him we will pay first and pick up the TV tomorrow as we needed to return the TV we bought from Bestbuy first as we didn't have space.  Thank you for a wonderful experience and we will definitely be buying more from Rhythm from SE marine Drive Visions.\n\nThanks, Donald",

Very friendly and helpful sales person - got all my info quickly, and when I got home there was already an email with the invoice and order (special order item!). And the store was roomy enough that I could take my bicycle in, without getting in the way of customers or staff. Would highly recommend.",
