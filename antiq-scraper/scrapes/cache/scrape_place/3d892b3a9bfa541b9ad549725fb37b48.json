They gave us over 40 large packing bins for packing (returnable), so we didn't need to get any boxes.They wrapped everything and they were working like machines. Yet, their prices are more than reasonable based on quality of their job and the timing. I always recommend Nash Moving to my clients for moving and to my friends and other realtors as well. Next time we move, Nash Moving is our to go company. Way to go guys! You definitely changed the way this industry works! Have you heard of people tipping movers before? Neither did I :)) And we sure did! These guys do amazing job and fully deserve to be tipped. That's how great they are! We recommend Nash Moving for your next move!",

Nothing was broken during the move, which is a miracle, in my opinion. They are professional and they got it completed in a timely manner (other moving companies, in my experience, waste time sitting around trying to get even more money). This company is a company of integrity, one that can be trusted, and one I'd definitely use again in the future.",
