It suppose to come with 10 pcs but they gave me 9 first and told me one more coming and I appreciate their honesty\nPortion of spicy noodle was quite small with a few pieces of meat only\nThe worse is the green onion pancake, dry, tasteless , hard and look aged\nOverall with this price range for Shanghai food definitely worth a try!",

One part of the kitchen has a window where you can see the dumplings being freshly made. Note: the wonton come with 10 pieces, we already tried 2 before I decided to take a picture. We are definitely coming back for more!",

I got the Steamed Pork Buns (Xiao Long Bao/Soup Dumplings), Pan Fried Pork Buns, Pan Fried Dumplings and Beef Roll! I would recommend everything because it was really affordable and yummy. The soup from the Steamed and Fried Pork Buns was really flavourful! The Pan Fried Dumplings had a lot of filling and isn't like other dumplings I've had at other restaurants (which are sometimes frozen). You have to get the Beef Roll, I love the amount of meat, cucumbers and sauce there is in it! Another thing I like is how they have chili oil and vinegar at the table for you! I can't wait to come back and try their noodles and wontons,unfortunately it was too hot for that today.",
