I preferred the former while my wife preferred the latter. Both were so good.\n\nIt's not a restaurant but more of a takeout place with some outdoor seating. I love it as it serves great lobster rolls without much fanfare and sitting outdoors in a casual environment is such an enjoyment.\n\nWe visited the live seafood next door where we were keen to try the sea urchins. However, they don't cut the sea urchins for you so I decided it was too much hassle to cut it myself. It didn't look as delicious as ones I had in Hokkaido so am ok to give it a pass.\n\nDon't miss out on the lobster rolls though.",

Freshness: Live seafood is the epitome of freshness. When you order live lobster, crab, or oysters, you can be confident that you're getting seafood at its peak quality and flavor.\n\n2. Flavor: Live seafood tends to have a more delicate and succulent flavor compared to seafood that has been frozen or stored for an extended period. The natural sweetness of these creatures is best preserved when they are alive until just before cooking.\n\n3. Texture: The texture of live lobster and crab is exceptional. When cooked properly, the meat is tender, juicy, and full of natural juices, making it a delightful dining experience. Oysters, on the other hand, are prized for their unique texture and briny, oceanic taste.\n\n4. Interactive Dining: There's an interactive aspect to dining on live seafood. Preparing and cracking open a lobster or crab can be a fun and engaging experience, perfect for social gatherings and special occasions.\n\nIt's really fun dining experience here in lobster man.\n\nEspecially thank staff Sean.\nHe provided exceptional service.
