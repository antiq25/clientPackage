Honestly, they are best fish and chips I've ever had--better others I've had in Greater Vancouver!\n\nThe in-house tartar sauce was sooo delicious as well (can squeeze out as much as I want); it had a fresh, tarty dill taste.\n\nThe onion rings and oyster were good. And the tomato juice was tasty and refreshing.\n\nThe mushy peas, however, were not my cup of tea (it, to me, is like a coarse base puree that's just salted).\n\nIt was quite the satiating lunch; perfect for going to a hike trail afterward.  Moreover, I did not need to eat dinner.\n\nAs for the service, it's excellent. I liked the waitress' personality; she's chill and accommodating.",
