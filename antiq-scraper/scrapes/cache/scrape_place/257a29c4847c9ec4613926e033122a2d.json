Love how they support local farmers and have unique high quality ingredients.\n\nWhen I was poor college student, I usually got the okonomiyaki or one of the stone bowls, one caterpillar roll, and 1 dessert and that was enough to satisfy me and my friend. I usually got something that was high in carbs that way it fills me up. That way it doesn't go over my budget.\n\nNow, I get anything from their special menu, it's always different depending on the seasons. I am never disappointed what I am about to taste.\n\nThe service is good and friendly!\n\nThe atmosphere there is calming, chill, classy. The music in that restaurant is very relaxing in my opinion.\n\nAlso, the tables are always clean and same with the dishes and cutlery.\n\nTip: This place is quite popular so the wait time to get a table might take long (1hr +). So I suggest you make a reservation, come at 5pm, or eat a small snack before you go but that depends on your eating schedule.",

The atmosphere is so incredibly calm, the service very attentive and the kitchen very calm and organized.\n\nI had the spicy salmon roll and it was delicious. My friend had the sashimi salad and it was delicious as well. Coming from a former cook & server used to the service industry, kishimoto does everything right, even down to the plating of the food.\n\n10/10 would come again ",

The wait was worth it tho.\n\nWe ordered 2 kinds of oshi which were incredibly delicious but a bit smaller than I expected. Nonetheless, the flavour in each bite were amazing.\n\nThe veggie okonomiyaki was surprisingly good even if it's filled with just onions, cabbages and mushrooms. Looks can be deceiving so don't judge this okonomiyaki till you try it.",
