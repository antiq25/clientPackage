As you can see, the \"reserved\" pick up spots were all parked, with no one inside their cars. I supposed there wasn't sufficient parking? Entered the closest stall number and waited for more than 5 mins, and no one came out with my order. So I decided to go in and grabbed my order. Waited for too long so I had to leave right away. Ordered no ice on all my drinks and guess what... THEY ALL HAD ICE! Just look how much ice there are. There's enough to sink the Titanic again.",
