If everyone at the table gets a dish worth $9 or more then you get unlimited rice, miso soup, and salad. Which is great because their salad is so good as is their dressing and really gives your palate a break/reset from the deep fried foods that is your main meal. We got a side of curry because katsu and curry is just a perfect combination and if you've never poured curry over your katsu before, definitely recommend it!",

The food was so fresh, tasted delicious, and I don't think we had to wait too like despite it being quite busy. We ordered 1 rosu katsu ($25), 1 rosu curry ($28), and 2 cheese katsus ($26.50 for one order). Although this place is quite pricey, it's worth it for the experience and the quality and amount of food. The cheese katsu is quite rich, the rosu curry is quite flavourful, and the breading of all of the katsus were amazing!\n\nWe highly recommend coming here, but DON'T FORGET TO MAKE A RESERVATION/BE PUT ON THE WAITING LIST ONLINE, because it's super busy once it opens, and you'll have to wait 30+ minutes if you don't have one.",
