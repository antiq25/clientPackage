It was too much food for me, so I offered some to my team coworkers, and their response was that it was very good, indeed. One of my coworkers had a second piece, and it was only a small pizza to begin with. Definitely a spectacular choice for pizza, so check it out!",

I was drawn to promo deals via Door Dash and Best Eaters Combo ($39.99) seemed perfect for 9 of us.\n\nI ordered Butter Chicken Pizza, Everything Special, chicken wings and bread stick. I didn't know bread sticks were substitution for additional wings for the order.\n\nFood was pretty good. All my families were happy even nieces and nephew. Wings were very tasty too. One niece told me it was bit spicy, but everyone else liked it. The deal was unbeatable. Bread sticks were good too. I wish they had extra amount of wings in stock. Food was pretty memorable. I liked 2 free pops included in the combo.",

I was drawn to promo deals via Door Dash and Best Eaters Combo ($39.99) seemed perfect for 9 of us.\n\nI ordered Butter Chicken Pizza, Everything Special, chicken wings and bread stick. I didn't know bread sticks were substitution for additional wings for the order.\n\nFood was pretty good. All my families were happy even nieces and nephew. Wings were very tasty too. One niece told me it was bit spicy, but everyone else liked it. The deal was unbeatable. Bread sticks were good too. I wish they had extra amount of wings in stock. Food was pretty memorable. I liked 2 free pops included in the combo.",

The last time she wanted to charge me for 3 slices when I just had 1, fortunately I pointed it out and she put the correct amount. It is a good spot for pizza, I will still come on the days she is not working as she is really gloomy with a bad attitude for customer service.",
