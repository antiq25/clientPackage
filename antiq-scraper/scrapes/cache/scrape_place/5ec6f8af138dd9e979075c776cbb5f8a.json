The produce quality is good and prices reasonable. Staff is too busy at the counter but will help out if you plead long enough. If you live on the North shore, this is a must visit because we don't have anything like it. Parking is easier than expected behind the store and also on the adjacent street. Overall good place to find Indian items.",

When it came for my turn I paid the bill and was having my hand in the air for receipt but she just threw it on the counter like she was doing very everyone else. It was my last visit to the store and would make sure my message would be heard by all the customers and the appropriate authorities. Don't know if that employee was like that or they have this kind of standard for all employees but it was very bad experience.",
