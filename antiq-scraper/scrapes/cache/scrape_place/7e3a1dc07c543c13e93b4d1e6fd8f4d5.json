While we waited for my mom to do her shopping my dad and my sisters were looking at outdoor patio because we were interested in buying some for our backyard for the summer so we sat on a couple of the patio chairs to test it out and we were just enjoying ourselves saying how nice the furniture was. They had hats on the table and so we tired a couple while we waited. Then this lady rushes over and hovers and asks if we're done. We got up and left to go check out patio umbrellas. My dad was interested in a couple of them and wanted to see how they worked so he cracked the lever, safely and slowly, not causing an hard to anyone or anything, just genuinely wanted to see how it would open, and this same lady RUNS over and tells us we can't be touching things? We could see her watching us everywhere we would go shop and we felt so uncomfortable and it ruined our entire shopping experience. Felt like we were being racially profiled and we were being watched. We weren't doing anything suspicious, we genuinely wanted to shop. My family and I left feeling so unhappy with our entire experience, I don't recommend going there and I don't think we'll be back. The lady had dark complexion and a pony tail in braids. Horrible horrible experience. Ruined my mom's Mother's Day shopping experience as well as ours.",
