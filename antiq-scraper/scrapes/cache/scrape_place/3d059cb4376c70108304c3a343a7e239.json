We didn't wait long and took the shuttle. The shuttle to and from the airport was free. Staff were amazing at understanding our circumstances and making us feel at home. It's a few mins from the airport and the rooms are spacious and clean. They even mailed my son's earphones that he had left behind to us! Thank you for your great service.",
