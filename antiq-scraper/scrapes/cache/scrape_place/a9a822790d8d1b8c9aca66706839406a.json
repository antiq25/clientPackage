The masa was perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of moisture, while the fillings were packed with flavor. I particularly enjoyed the jalapeno and cheese tamal, which had a great balance of flavour and was incredibly satisfying. The staff were also super friendly and attentive, making for a great experience overall. I highly recommend their tamales to anyone looking for authentic, tasty Mexican bite.",
