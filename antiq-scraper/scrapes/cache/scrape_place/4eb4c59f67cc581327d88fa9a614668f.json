Alvin, the owner, was very professional, knowledgeable, responsive, personable, and accommodating. He came on-site several times - something few companies do. They work VERY hard for you. One time, the painter ruined the HDMI cable, so Repel brought a new one - except it was defective, so they stayed a couple hours until Alvin's brother brought a replacement and retested everything before they left. It was so easy to just leave a new cable without doing anything, but these guys do everything with diligence.\n\nWe got their home monitoring install + service, security camera package, low voltage (TV/telephone/internet) install, home theatre package, central vacuum, water bug, you name it. Repel offers competitor top tier monitoring service package for a price cheaper than the competitor's basic price!\n\nWe've used their products for 3 months now, and the only issue I had was with the security cameras. The manufacturer is from China and partially state-owned so I'm a bit paranoid about installing their app on my phone. And we've had a couple of connectivity issues on the monitor. HOWEVER, it does the job so I can't complain.\n\nIf you are deciding between Repel and another company, always, always, always choose Repel. Save yourself some trouble, time, and money.",
