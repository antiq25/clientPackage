They made the fresh.  They didn't have fries pre made.  So the fries were fresh and hot.  I watched her make the friend and it is quite the process.  I can see why people complain about the time.  But it's made to order and it's a process to season the fries.  My kids and family loved the fries.  The kids loved the corn and I wish we ordered bigger size.  Next time I would order larger size cause it didn't not last long and it's not much of a price increase for a bigger size.  Really friendly staff and can tell she took pride in her work.  I hope they continue to provide excellent fries without compromising the quality for speeding up the process.",

So happy they have 2 locations here and this one is nice and spacious. Friendly and helpful staff, great selection of fries and flavours, cool drinks. If you love salty snacks, make sure you grab some Potato Corner! Waffle, curly fries and tater tots are awesome!!",

Grabbed the \"Tere\" size which is their extra large fries option that you're allowed two different flavours. We ended going with the Chili Barbeque because they didn't have the plain barbeque seasoning. This was probably my favourite over the truffle seasoning that we had. The truffle flavour is there but also it's very salty in my honest opinion.",

It's like a hybrid between fries and chips. The seasoning was great, not overly salty (had a hint of sweetness to balance the flavour), and evenly coated as well. Very crispy, and stays crispy - no sogginess even at the bottom.\n\nProcess: They take your order, and then you wait for your fries to come out of this (air fryer-like?) machine - which takes a while, then they dump the fries into a tray, scoop them back up to throw them in a bucket to shake with seasoning (by hand), then throw them BACK on ANOTHER tray after seasoning, then scoop them up into your bucket/bag. Seems tedious, but I assume they have their reasons as they're a huge chain and very popular in Asia.",
