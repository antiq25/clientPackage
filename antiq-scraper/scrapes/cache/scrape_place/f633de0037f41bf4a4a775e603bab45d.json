It's clean and has always had consistent friendly service.\n\nNice patio and indoor space that has games playing too.\n\nOnly drawback was the lettuce used in the Cobb salad was made with cheap iceberg lettuce. The salad was $17, would expect at least romaine however the fried chicken was very well done with a tasty light batter.",
