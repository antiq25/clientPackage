It was surprisingly refreshing trying a drink that's more catered towards the western palate every once and awhile.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Nuggets with Rice and was surprised at how authentic the seasoning for the chicken was. It's heavily seasoned (which I prefer) and was fresh from the fryer--very juicy. However, for the amount I paid, I expected a somewhat larger portion but given the location, it makes sense. If you're looking for more bang for your buck, I would recommend giving 'Wow Full Noodle House' a try! However, this restaurant's service was swift and is perfect for an officer worker's lunch break.",

Once it got to around 12:30, all the tables were full.\nWe ordered the chicken nuggets with noodles and braised pork rice. The braised pork rice was heavy on the rice. The pork itself was very fatty which I liked but the flavour was somewhat one dimensional. They are very generous with the portions here.\nThe chicken nuggets with noodles in soup was also generous in price. Lots of noodles. The soup was plain but enjoyable as it off balanced the fried chicken. The fried chicken was okay. Not crispy enough and also not juicy enough.\nThe food was mediocre overall. Not too pricey but not cheap either.\nService wise - food came out a bit slow as it was busy but servers are nice and don't rush you even though it's busy.\nI saw the tables around me and they were all eating rice and noodles dishes. Their portion sizes are definitely on the bigger size so keep that in mind when ordering. It's a nice addition to the downtown lunch scene when you are craving Asian food.",
