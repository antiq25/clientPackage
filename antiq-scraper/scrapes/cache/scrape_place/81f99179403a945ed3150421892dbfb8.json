Name your favorite dish and they have it!\n\nI commend not only their appetizing food but also their great customer service. The front staff are nice and helpful.\n\nI recommend their Combo Special where you can choose any two dishes and a cup of rice. My husband loved their Lechon Kawali, Buko Pandan and Leche Flan. Yes, they have a variety of desserts as well! So many to choose from so we always make sure to order takeout.\n\nWe will surely go back again. ",

Name your favorite dish and they have it!\n\nI commend not only their appetizing food but also their great customer service. The front staff are nice and helpful.\n\nI recommend their Combo Special where you can choose any two dishes and a cup of rice. My husband loved their Lechon Kawali, Buko Pandan and Leche Flan. Yes, they have a variety of desserts as well! So many to choose from so we always make sure to order takeout.\n\nWe will surely go back again. ",
