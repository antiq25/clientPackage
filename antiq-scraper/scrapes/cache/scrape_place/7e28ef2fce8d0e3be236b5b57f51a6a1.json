I had the crispy chicken special (recipe changes weekly) and this time it had truffle in it.  All the components that were in the sandwich from the house made bread to the sauce to the breaded chicken to the fresh greens inside were super fresh, and super tasty and flavourful. So many times a breaded chicken can easily be too dry or too salty but this was pure perfection. I also had a cruffin that had a delightfully light and fresh filling and an oat milk latte and both were also items I would come back for individually as well.  To absolutely nail it on all 3 items is a major feat, and truly a testament to this hole in the wall. Chef's kiss! Will absolutely be back.",
