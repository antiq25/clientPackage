A fry burger and a pop. How sad it is that they cannot have enough food ready to go. I understand that demand is higher at certain times but 25 minutes from order to getting food is ridiculous. And when you refuse to be parked you get even worse service because now you are going against the normal, it's a drive thru and I should have to pull over and wait. While I sat and waited for my order 6 to 7 vehicles were parked so they can make their time for drive thru.  Truly terrible management for thinking this is acceptable to treat customers like this.\n\nAfter receiving my order my fry level is laughable. Ordered junior McChicken extra mayo and received my mcchicken with no mayo\n\nHow do you mess that up.\nCompletely unacceptable.\n\nCorporate McDonald's needs to review this location and it's management for customer service and drive thru operations.",
