Rice under the lamb way completely cold (I didn't sent it back since already had started eating the lamb before trying the rice but main reason is just don't like to send my food back). The portion seemed a bit smaller than before but it was enough for me. The price is low compare to most other restaurants but that might be the reason of a bit drop on quality.

The rice pilaf wasn't the best I've had - could've used more flavour and unfortunately it was cold. However, the lamb and potato were warm so it was fine to eat with the rice. They also served free pita bread which came out hot and fresh and great with the Tzatziki.\n\nGreat patio setting, I like that they have the plastic barriers up to separate the tables - it makes it more intimate and quiet. The place was packed on a Saturday night and they only had three servers. Waited about 15 min for a table at 8pm and many people were stopping in for pizza take out. Table service was a bit slow but our service did a great job and was friendly.",
