Could you remind me what your company is and what you came to us looking for? I would be the first to admit that we do suggest to some people who talk to us that we are not a perfect fit when it either makes more sense to hire someone internally or go with an individual rather than an integrated engineering team, but I don't recall ever turning someone away without a good explanation of why it might more sense to take a different strategy. Many other firms may be more likely to take on the work even if it isn't the best move for the client. Are you sure it was our company that you talked to? Again, I'm sorry that we did not get a chance to work together and I hope that you have been successful with your venture.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJosh Usher",
