You can have a coffee and get a bird's-eye view of the store, or watch out the window at the traffic on Cambie Street.  There's a nice selection of food in the coffee shop and you can get a much wider selection of ready to eat food in Whole Foods Market.  The coffee is good, the staff are great, service is fast.  They do a lot of recycling in the coffee shop and the Market.  WiFi is good.  Bathroom is good.  The only problem is that (at the moment) the coffee shop closes at 2PM.  But there is cafe seating in the Market below.  Which is nice.  I only like to review places I like and this definitely one of them.  It's got a good vibe.
