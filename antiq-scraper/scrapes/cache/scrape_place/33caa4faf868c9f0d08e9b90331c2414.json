I came across FoodPak by total coincidence when a truck with their logo on it drove past me on the highway last summer. I had just been discussing the issues we were having around sourcing the sustainable packaging we had hoped to use for our new products, when I turned and saw the FoodPak advertising right there on the truck in the lane beside me. That was the beginning of what has been the most positive and professional experience we have had as new entrepreneurs on this journey. Nick was so informative and patient with our high maintenance requests, and went above and beyond with sourcing and creating the perfect packaging to fit the vision of our brand.  He listened, then communicated his plan, and then executed on that plan on budget and ahead of schedule.  We are already excited about what we can create with FoodPak in the future and are so grateful for the outstanding customer service and product we received.  Thank you!",
