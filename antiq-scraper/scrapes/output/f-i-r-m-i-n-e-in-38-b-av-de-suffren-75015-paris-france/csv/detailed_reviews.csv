From the moment I walked in, I knew this was going to be a memorable experience. Our server, Balvin, added a delightful touch to our evening. His warm and friendly demeanor made practicing my basic French an absolute joy. He was attentive, considerate, and a true gentleman throughout our meal. Now, lets talk about the food! We ordered the Diavola pizza, and it was nothing short of amazing. Having just arrived from Italy earlier in the day, we were pleasantly surprised that it measured up to the authentic Italian pizza we know and love. The ambiance at Firmine is simply enchanting. The music created the perfect backdrop, and the lighting set a romantic mood that made our dinner even more special. While its true that dining at Firmine may be a bit on the pricey side, its entirely understandable given its prime location near the Eiffel Tower. After all, real estate in such a prestigious area certainly comes at a premium. Lastly, I must debunk a common stereotype about Parisian restaurants. Contrary to the belief that they may have snooty staff, our experience at Firmine was the complete opposite. Balvin and the entire team were warm, welcoming, and genuinely interested in ensuring we had a fantastic dining experience. In summary, Firmine exceeded all expectations, earning a solid 5/5 rating. If you find yourself in Paris and crave a taste of Italy in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, dont hesitate to make a reservation at this hidden gem.
