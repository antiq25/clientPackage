Staff were quickly responsive to requests I made and food delivery was allowed to deliver the food directly to my room.

Short Drive to day trip to see Big Red Wood Trees. Business and 39th Wedding Anniversary trip. No hot tub beside the swimming pool available bc of Covid. I wanted the kitchen and it s great. Needs a cutting board. We had lots of Coffee and bought cream & groceries at the Local grocery store. There is No desk to work at. So the ironing board worked out well. The table would work but the bed was softer. No couch. But there s nice sitting areas around the Hotel. Old technology didn t work with the TV. Ironing board is useful! Plz add a foot stool with the chair for tired travellers. The lamp charger doesn t work. And the night light and clock are Bright! I covered them up! The mushrooms outside are Poisonous  . Possibly should be Removed. Nice time of Year to travel. Fortunately it s quiet on our side of the building because there s a lot of traffic on the   rise  side of the building. Beautiful sunset dinners here. We ll have great memories from BC. Far from home in Ontario. Checking out local wines.   Amazing selection at the grocery store. WoW!

The main concern we had when booking this hotel was the noise (we are generally quite sensitive to noise during sleep), but it wasnt a big deal at all during our 3-night stay. All the rooms are facing the highway, I believe, so there wasnt any road noise. We didnt hear any airplane noise either. Some of the reviews have mentioned the truck unloading noise at the Costco right next to it, but I dont think I heard that before 9 AM, and with the white noise machine on, I dont think any noise outside would have impacted our sleep.

We had to fly to Philippines and had nowhere to park our truck for the month-long that we will be gone and no other hotel will let you park your car that long in the vicinity other than the Holiday Inn. The staff were very helpful in answering and accomodating all our queries and gave us a very reasonable price as well for the whole month that we will have to leave our truck. It was also a great and secured area so it gave us peace of mind  while we were away. Location is very convenient as well as its just near the airport. Just right across the hotel is Costco if you needed something and some restaurants as well. They also serve complimentary breakfast which exceeded my expectation.

I chose this Holiday Inn Express because it was super close to the train station from the Port of Vancouver and also a $10 ride to the airport. It took us maybe 10 minutes to walk with our luggage - just dont listen to Google when it tells you to walk through the Costco lot on a Sunday. Because they were sold out the night before from other cruises, we were unable to check in early (10a) but Cindy checked our luggage and we went to Gastown for the day. After lunch (1p), I called to see if we could check in early and they said that we could. Cindy checked us in and thanked me for being an IHG member. She informed us about breakfast times and also asked if we needed a shuttle ride to the airport, which is complimentary! Yes, we definitely need a ride to the airport. It picks up on the 20 and 40 of every hour and I would suggest showing up 3 hours prior to your international flight. The room was so much larger than I expected and the bed was so comfortable! The bathroom is also larger than most other hotel rooms so that is really nice to have so much space. In addition to the king bed, we had a desk and chair, a wardrobe, a larger mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, chaise lounger, and a closet. They also provide Dove shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in refillable containers to be more eco friendly and offer a white noise machine to help you sleep. I would definitely stay here again due to how friendly the staff is, the proximity to public transportation, proximity to the Richmond Night Market (10 min walk), and how spacious and comfortable the room is.",a year ago,2022-11-22 02:49:50.372275,"Hello Florence Vianzon, Thank you for taking the time to write a candid review.

The staff were friendly and accommodating, special shout out to Eric and Joanna in particular for fantastic front desk service. The free daily breakfast is quite nice, I definitely recommend the pancakes. Cleaning and towel changes were done regularly and well. The complimentary shuttle saved us fares both ways to and from the airport (only a 10 minute ride). The nearest Skytrain station is Bridgeport, which is a less-than-10-minute walk. Add on another five minutes, and you can reach the Richmond Night Market! Our room had a Keurig, Microwave, Fridge, and TV available for use. Of particular note to me was the size of the TV. Most hotels Ive been to choose rather small screen sizes, but the size and placement of this one was near optimal for the beds. The only thing I can speak negatively about (which is out of their control) is the noise. You WILL hear the Costco across the street unload at night. My wife was able to sleep through it, but I was glad I packed ear plugs. I also recommend closing the bathroom door as night, as the ventilation system seems to channel in the noise from outside.",2 years ago,2021-11-22 02:49:51.062381,"Hello Jesse Chu, Thank you for taking the time to write a 5-star review and for recently staying at our property.

Booked via hotwire for a super good deal (under $100 before fees and tax), was expecting a lower-tier normal hotel but this honestly feels nothing short of a 4-star hotel to us. Highly recommended. Room equipped with keurig, new thin TV with HDMI ports on the wall, cool lights, everything is brand new. Free breakfast from 6-10AM. Few minutes drive to airport. Easy to find street parking outside. (Parked just across the street, it was empty) free coffee 24/7 in the lobby. Best deal in town!!!",5 years ago,2018-11-22 02:49:54.396863,,,,0,6,4,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112017299547621534133/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

ChIJk7rjLh51hlQRADcwjAAs3J4,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBNU8tMnRRRRAB,Andrew Robakiewicz,5,Well I really liked it but the one thing that I did not like is that there are not enough wall outlets for charging your device. I really think that they need more.  The breakfast was great though and parking was easy. The elevators were fast and the key cards were extremely easy to use. -Thanks,7 years ago,2016-11-22 02:49:54.402395,,,,0,5,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106201089725302323377/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,
