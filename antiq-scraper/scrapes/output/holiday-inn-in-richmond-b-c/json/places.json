This property was just what I needed to help turnaround my day. The staff were friendly, welcomed me with a smile, and even proactively helped me with unloading and storing my bags. Parking a bit odd in terms of layout and design but very manageable once you understand how it works. Staff were quickly responsive to requests I made and food delivery was allowed to deliver the food directly to my room. This hotel is a gem that is of the best Holiday Inns I ve stayed at in a long time. I would be delighted to stay here again next time I m in the area and need a hotel near the airport.",

We needed a shuttle to and from hotel and that was not a problem. In fact, the shuttle was delayed leaving the hotel to go to the airport, so we were ordered a taxi by the staff, and we didnt have to wait.  The taxi was paid for by the hotel.  I recommend anyone wanting a clean, comfortable room with staff that pay attention to detail, stay here. Thank you for an enjoyable, restful stay at your beautiful hotel.",

I had to leave before breakfast, so I cant comment on that. I did have dinner at the in-house restaurant the night I stayed. It was decent enough. I had the chicken wings and the hazy IPA beer. The beer was excellent. The wings were average, but still good. The restaurant has kind of a cafeteria feel to it, which is kinda meh, but it was still good.",

I do have one small disappointment in that I called in to the morning to request a room that didnt face the highway and they could not make that happen. I will say that the view though was fairly decent. The noise wasnt that bad from the cars below. The room itself was clean and large. Two queen beds and still plenty of room to not feel crowded. The beds were comfortable and provided a nice place to watch tv on. The television was large and its a smart tv so you can screen mirror although I used a Roku. This hotel would be perfect if it had a pool. But still a decent place to stay if you are not caring about amenities.",

We didnt have a reservation but they could see we had a bad night so they took us in right away, gave us a complimentary drink and a deal for the room. They even let us check out at a later time so we didnt have to wait 2 hrs at the car dealership to get our vehicle back. THIS IS HOW CUSTOMER SERVICE SHOULD BE! Thank you so much for your kindness and hospitality! :)",

The gentleman at the front desk was soooooo incredibly helpful and accommodating, setting up cab rides, wake up calls, and shuttle rides for myself and my infant daughter when we recently stayed to have her congenital heart condition followed-up at BC Childrens Hospital. He was cheery and friendly and answered all of our questions, as well as informing us about all the Covid policies we needed to know about. The room was exceptionally clean and comfortable and even though Ive been sleep-deprived with a newborn, super grouchy from postpartum hormones, and stressed to the max dealing with a baby with severe previously-unknown health complications after birth (literally every reason to be in a bad mood with a short fuse right now...) it felt like a mini vacation! We will be visiting Vancouver frequently over the next year and we absolutely will NOT hesitate to stay here again. Thank you for going the extra mile, having exceptional customer service and cleanliness, and being a small ray of sunshine and comfort in an otherwise stressful and horrible situation.

Within walking distance there is a rec center , movie theater , brew pub , ice rink... Drive to the end of no5 or a number of other roads and there are nice natural spaces and parks a good place when you unexpectedly have a long lay over or a early morning flight . Longterm parking with the airport shuttle make it all the sweeter. I missed it by a minute and they called it back for me . The morning breakfast was beefy . Pancakes,  biscuits,  sausage,  Turkey sausage   , scrambled eggs , beans, coffee , juice , fruitloops and muffins bagels ! Typically cheap as well Id give it a HELLS YEAH . Nearby activities: Theater , ice rink , Lazer tag , air park , bar , gym ,pool",

Alittle disappointed that when I was in line waiting my turn to check-in, one of the front desk clerks bypassed me and checked in another customer which I thought was rude. I hate to even bring this up. I m Black and the Indian front desk clerk checked in a White family ahead of me even though I was there first. I was so tired and just wanted to relax that it really didn t hit me till after I got in my room. For such a perfect hotel, that moment kinda ruined my stay. Still get 5 stars because this is the second time I ve stayed at this hotel and the front desk clerk, she was mixed with glasses, was beyond amazing.",

The management and staff went above and beyond to ensure that we could extend our accommodation even though they were booked near to capacity every night. The breakfast crew were outstanding and offered lots of GF options for a family member requiring it. The rooms were spacious and clean, and our grandkids really loved the swimming pool. Special shout out and kudos to Ana at the front desk who was so kind and compassionate during our stressful time, and also to the Breakfast Ambassador who was incredible in her role in providing great food and excellent service.",

No hot tub beside the swimming pool available bc of Covid. I wanted the kitchen and it s great. Needs a cutting board. We had lots of Coffee and bought cream & groceries at the Local grocery store. There is No desk to work at. So the ironing board worked out well. The table would work but the bed was softer. No couch. But there s nice sitting areas around the Hotel. Old technology didn t work with the TV. Ironing board is useful! Plz add a foot stool with the chair for tired travellers. The lamp charger doesn t work. And the night light and clock are Bright! I covered them up! The mushrooms outside are Poisonous  . Possibly should be Removed. Nice time of Year to travel. Fortunately it s quiet on our side of the building because there s a lot of traffic on the   rise  side of the building. Beautiful sunset dinners here. We ll have great memories from BC. Far from home in Ontario. Checking out local wines.   Amazing selection at the grocery store. WoW! Staff are all helpful and friendly. Stay Here and enjoy the Best Mattress & Pillows! Breakfast has everything thank you!",

Loved how they went above and beyond then respected our space when napping. Great location, buttery soft beds, pillows and bedding. Great products in the room for our comfort. Continental breakfast was actually cooked in kitchen, meals, food prep and serving set up was all immaculate. Best hotel stay yet. Rooms: Roomy, gorgeous lighting, work desk and office chair, comfortable, white noise machine ( not needed as it was quiet) Walkability: Near all major bus and train routes, short walk to places.

The main concern we had when booking this hotel was the noise (we are generally quite sensitive to noise during sleep), but it wasnt a big deal at all during our 3-night stay. All the rooms are facing the highway, I believe, so there wasnt any road noise. We didnt hear any airplane noise either. Some of the reviews have mentioned the truck unloading noise at the Costco right next to it, but I dont think I heard that before 9 AM, and with the white noise machine on, I dont think any noise outside would have impacted our sleep. Rooms: The room was spacious. Food & drinks: There were plenty of food options for the free breakfast. The best among the hotels Ive stayed at in the past year that offer free breakfast.",

Breakfast for us was free and the variety was pretty good! There was also a cool pancake making machine. Beds were a bit too soft for our likings (we have a medium firm bed at home) and the walls were a little thin (we could hear the kids and water from our neighboring room).

We had to fly to Philippines and had nowhere to park our truck for the month-long that we will be gone and no other hotel will let you park your car that long in the vicinity other than the Holiday Inn. The staff were very helpful in answering and accomodating all our queries and gave us a very reasonable price as well for the whole month that we will have to leave our truck. It was also a great and secured area so it gave us peace of mind  while we were away. Location is very convenient as well as its just near the airport. Just right across the hotel is Costco if you needed something and some restaurants as well. They also serve complimentary breakfast which exceeded my expectation. All in all, it was a great and stress-free experience during our stay and will definitely come back if ever we are in the area again.",

If you dont need any fancy frills but want accommodating service, clean room/washroom, great bed and need to be close to the airport, this is it. Desk chair was even decent that I fell asleep watching the wall mounted TV that swivels. Staff easily booked a 4AM shuttle to the airport and light breakfast was ready even at that time (wish I couldve taken advantage of the main breakfast). If I had to be super picky, it was just slightly dim in terms of lighting in the main part of the room. Also, after checking in the cleaning lady(?) entered the room without knocking with a keycard which startled us but who wouldnt be.",

This was one of best places I have actually stayed  considering all factors. Staff was super nice, helpful and accommodating. They let me check in early and when my room wasnt going to be ready they put me in something else and did not charge me for that. Breakfast was perfect for those mornings on the fly and the rooms were super clean. The beds and linen are what I look forward to the most in any hotel and I didnt want to get out of bed it was that good for me. Indoor parking was ample, secure and easy to use. The team here should be proud of what they have because my experience and other reviews support how well they do here Thanks and I will see you again when I need a spot before flying out of BC Cheers Dave B",

We really appreciate the shuttle driver for accommodating our delayed evening flight. The other staff were super friendly and pleasant as well. There are great amenities in the rooms, even more than some other hotels I ve been at. The free breakfast is great with a good selection. There are pancakes, various proteins that change everyday, bread, fruits, and drinks. It s in a good area: the hotel is a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest transit station (depending on if you cut across the Costco parking lot), and it s across the street from a Costco and a great Chinese restaurant. The free shuttle only takes 10 minutes and it s fairly frequent. The only concern is the noise level, which is totally out of the staff s control. I could always hear things from the Costco loading dock, and since it s close to the airport we can hear planes all the time. Besides that, I would still highly recommend the hotel to everyone.",

Unfortunately my wife had a medical emergency the morning we were going to leave, requiring surgery and a lengthy hospital stay for her and extended stay at the hotel for me. All the staff was great, but a special shout out to Jon at the front desk, who rushed to our room to assist when I called 911 from the room phone. He also arranged for me to keep the room for the additional 7 nights. Thank you Jon, your help during that stressful time was very much appreciated. Since I was in the hotel much longer than expected, there were some other things about the hotel I appreciated: 1) the features of the room. Nice tv, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, lots of outlets and usb ports, a small window that actually opened, office desk area. 2) proximity to the sky train. It was about a 10 minute walk to the station. 3) coin op laundry machines. Needless to say, we didnt have a lot of clean clothes left since we were supposed to be at the end of our trip, so having laundry on site was a huge benefit. Again, thanks to Jon and the rest of the staff.",

                "review_text": "After our cruise, I wanted to stay an extra night in Vancouver because I just love this city! I chose this Holiday Inn Express because it was super close to the train station from the Port of Vancouver and also a $10 ride to the airport. It took us maybe 10 minutes to walk with our luggage - just dont listen to Google when it tells you to walk through the Costco lot on a Sunday. Because they were sold out the night before from other cruises, we were unable to check in early (10a) but Cindy checked our luggage and we went to Gastown for the day. After lunch (1p), I called to see if we could check in early and they said that we could. Cindy checked us in and thanked me for being an IHG member. She informed us about breakfast times and also asked if we needed a shuttle ride to the airport, which is complimentary! Yes, we definitely need a ride to the airport. It picks up on the 20 and 40 of every hour and I would suggest showing up 3 hours prior to your international flight. The room was so much larger than I expected and the bed was so comfortable! The bathroom is also larger than most other hotel rooms so that is really nice to have so much space. In addition to the king bed, we had a desk and chair, a wardrobe, a larger mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, chaise lounger, and a closet. They also provide Dove shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in refillable containers to be more eco friendly and offer a white noise machine to help you sleep. I would definitely stay here again due to how friendly the staff is, the proximity to public transportation, proximity to the Richmond Night Market (10 min walk), and how spacious and comfortable the room is.",

We used the fitness room and it was surprisingly really nice. Like I would be happy if that was the fitness room in my apartment!

Comfortable bed with soft sheets and feathery pillows, well laid out room, big closet... It does the simple things right for a low cost option. There is even an adjustable white noise machine if you want/need one to sleep. Ill definitely be back the next time Im stuck at YVR for the night.",

The staff were friendly and accommodating, special shout out to Eric and Joanna in particular for fantastic front desk service. The free daily breakfast is quite nice, I definitely recommend the pancakes. Cleaning and towel changes were done regularly and well. The complimentary shuttle saved us fares both ways to and from the airport (only a 10 minute ride). The nearest Skytrain station is Bridgeport, which is a less-than-10-minute walk. Add on another five minutes, and you can reach the Richmond Night Market! Our room had a Keurig, Microwave, Fridge, and TV available for use. Of particular note to me was the size of the TV. Most hotels Ive been to choose rather small screen sizes, but the size and placement of this one was near optimal for the beds. The only thing I can speak negatively about (which is out of their control) is the noise. You WILL hear the Costco across the street unload at night. My wife was able to sleep through it, but I was glad I packed ear plugs. I also recommend closing the bathroom door as night, as the ventilation system seems to channel in the noise from outside.",

The bath and body works lotion is a nice touch.  Breakfast is served by the staff and rotates daily.  Between scrambled eggs, cheese omelettes, hard boiled eggs.  The meat was rotated to either have bacon, Turkey sausage or pork sausage. There was ample choice to satisfy everyone.  Apple, bananas, yogurt milk, juice, pancakes baked goods, toast and 3 different kinds of cereal.  The hotel is near the highway leading into Vancouver.  Parking is $12 but if youre and IHG member its free.",

The room was very comfortable and was clearly recently updated, with tons of USB ports, modern furniture, and a very sleek washroom. The service was great, the person at the front prepared a to-go breakfast for me because I had to leave before the breakfast. She also booked me on the shuttle for the morning but it had filled up so she made sure a cab arrived for me and it was pre-paid, so I was very grateful for this service. The only issues I had were that it took a while to get ahold of the front desk when I called from the airport to arrange a shuttle, and the shower in the morning took a while to warm up. But overall, I would highly recommend if you need something close to the airport because of a layover, missed flight, etc.",

Transfers to and from airport is smooth and round the clock. There is also a station for printing documents which was very useful in printing or boarding pass before heading to the airport. A vending machine with drinks and snacks seals the gap of our hungry tummy. Lots of restaurants in the area that delivers to the hotel too. They would also all if you want to have a Wake up call. Superb service. Bathrooms with branded toiletries and complete accessories. Huge windows and comfy bed. Pillows are a highlight. Large tv and coffee corner. Microwave helps me a lot.

John at the front desk was very helpful and made the check-in process quick and seamless. The room was better than I expected, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. I slept very well, and awoke rested. The modified breakfast (due to COVID-19 adjustments) was a good start for the day. And when it came time to leave, the front desk staff (sorry, didnt catch his name) was kind to offer me a free taxi to the airport as the shuttle was going to be full. Overall a genuine 5-star stay. I would gladly return here when Im having a layover in YVR!",

There is something to be said about a newly renovated hotel. The rooms are clean, contemporary, have lots of USB outlets, a white noise machine, and a large flat screen TV. There are no towel bars and the bathtub feels a bit cheap but those are minor and are the only negatives I could point out. The free breakfast is more than acceptable and includes bacon, turkey sausage, eggs, yogurt, fruit, cereal and a pancake machine. Long term parking is available for a pretty low rate if you stay at least one night at the hotel. This is accompanied by a free shuttle to and from the airport running every half hour. Regular guest parking is underground which is a perk. It was nice being across the street from Costco for a quick meal. Tim Hortons is also just around the corner. To top it off, the staff were friendly and quick to answer my questions. I would definitely stay here again.",

Due to the proximity of the airport, the planes landing and takeoffs noise can be annoying, the hotel does try to mitigate it with a white noise sound mechine in every room.",

Booked via hotwire for a super good deal (under $100 before fees and tax), was expecting a lower-tier normal hotel but this honestly feels nothing short of a 4-star hotel to us. Highly recommended. Room equipped with keurig, new thin TV with HDMI ports on the wall, cool lights, everything is brand new. Free breakfast from 6-10AM. Few minutes drive to airport. Easy to find street parking outside. (Parked just across the street, it was empty) free coffee 24/7 in the lobby. Best deal in town!!!",
