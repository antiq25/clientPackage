We sat in the Beatles booth and, as luck would have it, only had to wait about ten minutes... although the poor booth could do with some refurbishing. My food (patraimi burger) was regretfully meh, but wife and son were thrilled with theirs. The chocolate cake and ice cream stack desert was scrumptious. But know what really made this five stars over all? Our server, Steven. Such an awesome guy. Never made us feel rushed, easy banter and good suggestions. If all servers were like him, restaurants would be amazing. After sampling all three mixed soda options Id rank vanilla at the top, then cherry and chocolate. However, had I not over indulged in these, I wouldve asked for a 50/50 mix of cherry and chocolate... mixed a little I had left over and it was damn good!",

It takes me back to different stages of my life, eating with family or friends over the years. I have to say that I am kind of upset after my visit to Bob s Big Boy. Don t get me wrong, I didn t have bad food or bad service. The reason I am upset is that I don t know why it took me soooooo long to try the fried chicken at Bob s. The crunch off each and every bite was unreal. I also went for a side of biscuits and gravy. I have to say that the gravy is also an amazing dip for French fries! I think next time I go I will ask for my fries to be covered in it. My wife had the fish and chips and she loved them. The fish was flavorful and crunchy and the fries were perfect, especially dipped in the tartar sauce. I am now and will always be a long time Bob s Big Boy fan.",

Storied history, a literal landmark in LA and Hollywood.  Quick service, delicious food and best of all prices that were the opposite of their plus sized mascot. I had the guacamole and bacon chicken sandwich.  The chicken was moist, the bacon was crisp, but still had some chew to it and the lettuce and tomato were fresh.  The fries were good, but not outstanding.  If I had been paying tourist trap prices I might have complained, but instead our family of four was able to enjoy a nice meal for under $60 with tip.  That was including a milkshake!",

The interior, with all the orange vinyl, makes you feel like youre back in the 60s. The familiar taste of the famous Big Boy Burger did not disappoint. The salad was fresh with great ranch dressing. The fries were cooked perfectly. We even added on some of their amazing onion rings. Im glad they had takeout boxes as there was no way we could finish it all. It was the first time I took my daughter and I hope for many more opportunities to take her there. Parking: It was a slight wait to find a parking space in their large parking lot. Just shows how many others love Bobs too.",

Always such a pleasure seeing her happy face to start our day! All the servers at Bobs has ALWAYS been awesome no matter who you get! They run the operation like In and Out. Superb customer service and their quality of food, portions and pricing is always good. We originally headed to Sweet Butter on Ventura but opted for friendly smiles and table service. We decided to go all out today and have something out of the ordinary. We had the The Big Three and a Belgian Waflle with two eggs and sausage. Our Big Three came with three eggs, three flapjacks and three links of sausage. We ordered extra sausage on the side because their links are delicous! We already had pork belly last night so we werent feeling bacon today. Our Belgium Waffle combo came with two eggs and sausage. I had Janelle bring me fresh strawberries and butter for my waffle because Im not fond of syrup at all. We had such a great breakfast and a great start to our day knowing that we were able to be graced by Janelle. Shes the best! She always kept our drinks filled and just being around her was very calming. Its very busy at Bobs but when you have a chance to enjoy the good company and want great service, you can at Bobs. 2019: Love this place! No matter what time of day we visit, the service is excellent! We were greeted by a huge smile from Esther! She has the best sense of humor ever and is the sweetest. We didnt have to wait long at all. It was quick and the host was also friendly when he sat us. It was MLK Jr. Day so it was busy with many large parties. We had one of the best servers there, Kebra. She always had a smile and took really good care of us even though her section was quickly being filled by a couple of four tops and a large 15 top party.  She rocked and always remained serene and calm. We had the fried chicken entree and the 8 oz. Sirloin steak. With our entrees we chose a nice side salad, steamed vegetables and mash potatoes. His fried chicken came with white gravy. I didnt want gravy and Im so glad. Those were the creamiest, rich mash potatoes Ive ever had. I would definitely go there just for a side of them. The fried chicken was juicy, lightly crispy and well seasoned. My steak was cooked to perfection - rare. I was surprised that my steak was cooked so well. There was clear fluid running out of it yet it was seared, juicy and deliciously rare! This place never fails. Everyones attitudes are wonderful here and make our experience memorable. As we left, again we encountered lovely Esther who wished is a nice evening. Whatever they are doing here must be the same practices as In and Out because they never disappoint, provide exceptional customer service and the food preparation and quality is consistent. Kudos to the chefs and staff - no wonder its constantly the best 24/7!!!!",

But the greatest is the food which is still consistent and as delicious as I remember as a kid. The chili spaghetti is so unique and original and a standout for taste. The Pappy Parker fried chicken is the crispiest and some of the tastiest fried chicken of all time, and the classic Bobs combo really is the 1950s in a bite. Top it off with a hot fudge cake with fudge that tastes like no other and this is truly a gut busting, smile inducing meal.",

The key criteria are ambiance, deals, clientele, decor and food. 1. Ambience: Bobs big boy s ambiance is 10/10 everyone in California needs to see this. 2. Deals: Were talking deals. Pretty solid value for money. It s hard because there are other diners that also great value for money but can t complain, pretty good value for money. Not the best deal I ve ever had but not the worst deal. 3. Clientele: there were a lot of people at bbb at 11 o clock at night but we didn t have to wait long for a table. Other patrons also seemed to appreciate deals and milkshakes as many people ordered milkshakes. Unlike some diners I ve been to I didn t fear too much for my personal safety but I was a little intimidated but the BIG BOI holding the hamburger outside. 4: decor: speaking big boys, there some big big boys and smaller big boys (aka medium boys) displayed. Lots of diners draw inspiration from this classic decor. One comment when. Used the bathroom the gaps when I was using te toilet were so wide I could see in-n-out. Lastly 5: food: food was good, milkshake was great five stars.",

Of course you can never go wrong with a salad and their delicious blue cheese dressing. Yum! And what meal is complete with out a cherry coke. Food and staff are always wonderful but the food tasted especially good at 2:30 on the morning after a long day! Worth the trip to stop buy and grab a bite to eat.

Food & beverage details: Onion rings for the appetizer hot, crispy and *not* over-breaded! All my food came out hot, my fiance s fries were cold but they sent him a fresh hot plate right away, took less than 2 min to get the new hot plate of fries. If you ask for crispy fries they will do it right! Burgers were hot and delicious, we got the classic big boy combo and they came out fast. It was so delicious, I m pretty sure I inhaled it rather than chewed. I still can t believe I ve lived in the area for over 2 years and am just now having Bob s Big Boy for the first time. We will be back!!!",

Im not vegetarian,  so I dont look for those options on the menu. Dietary restrictions: There is something in the menu for everyone. You may also ask for your meal to be prepared with less salt,  no mayo,  etc... Parking: The only time it may be a challenge finding parking in the lot is during car hop night.  Otherwise,  there is valet and street parking available. Kid-friendliness: Its just a cool place! Lots to see that would be interesting to kids. Wheelchair accessibility: Yes,  there are no steps getting in or out of Bobs.  The restaurant is easy to get thru.  The only tight squeeze may be getting in and out of the restroom.",

But I wanted to look for myself, and he stood close by until I made my decision. He also gave me a lot of advice on the different couches and prices. Gabriel said something with empathy in his voice, that I liked very much! Im a customer before I am an employee He is very knowledgeable of the store policy, and the quality of their furniture! Also how to treat a customer like Family . I also liked the store manager , and he was very professional too! He made us laugh. My son was with me, and he said the people at that store are very nice and very  professional. I liked them a lot. They offered us free Tasty coffee and creamer. We  also sat there at the cafe in the back, and drank and spoke with the store clerk Gabriel. Everything was perfect and  so . I gave that store five      s - all day! This is the second time I bought furniture here and I will be coming back again! Thank you! BOBs Furniture!",

Visited this past Monday (President s Day) and anticipated it to be crowded or just lack luster with respect to customer experience. I checked out the website the Sunday before and located a bed that I was looking for. I cringed at the thought of goin into the store as a customer service representative for over 10 years -I know the pressures to meet sales goals. However there was no pressure from the Guest Experience Specialist ( Elivin) was very knowledgeable and even pointed out some defects which were part of the manufacturing details which I appreciated. I was not sure if I was going to finalize a purchase but I did. I met with the store manager and he closed the sale. Very impressed by the service and suggest if you live are in the neighborhood-please stop by you will not be disappointed!",

Assured me on the  new  bobs furniture insurance program. I had a not so great experience years ago and he completely turned my negative into a positive. Jason also introduced me to the manager Adam who was friendly and caring. Jason made the whole buying process quick easy and smooth. Definitely go see him for any buying needs!",

Bob s has set the standard from beginning to end. I will not shop at any other place for my home furniture needs. Thank you SO very much!!",

He gave us our space to look around talk and make a decision. Never any pressure to buy. He was very Knowledgeable about all the different choices of couches while keeping in mind our budget and what would work best for our home. We came a few months back and bought a dining set. Anthony also helped us with that purchase I could see in that short amount of time how much more Anthony had grown into a Salesman and advocate for Bobs Furniture I truly enjoyed working with him and would highly recommend him to anyone that is going to shop at Bobs thanks Anthony!!!!",

When we heard about Bobs memory foam, gel and spring hybrid beds we needed to check them out - and they exceeded our expectations! The foam was super supportive, remained cool, transferred no movement from one side to the other, and the inner springs made it so there were no memory indentations when you rolled over! If youre having trouble sleeping in your bed then I would strongly recommend you check out these hybrid beds! The price is 2/3 less than a Tempurpedic and the quality is superb. Great staff at Bobs too. They sure know their stuff.",

We looked at the two different reclining sofas we saw online and he knew every detail about both. However, the computer ordering system in the store has an issue that assigns a warehouse that isnt the warehouse where we would be picking up, Frank was explaining all of this information to us. He called over the store manager who immediately acted like he was better than anyone in the room. Frank was just giving him a friendly heads-up about how the system was still having the error. The manager responded weve gone over this multiple times and continued on, borderline embarrassing Frank. Frank was just letting him know it was still an issue, Frank was very knowledgeable and on point. We had to do some additional measuring and we were very happy to be able to give Frank Credit on our online order. He called and thanked us genuinely but I couldnt move forward without leaving this review about the manager as its been bothering me. Very distasteful, disrespectful, and not needed. I think some respect is needed for Frank who did a great job giving us all the information we needed to finalize our purchase. I think the manager needs some training on how to treat employees with respect and dignity especially in front of customers- my two cents.",

She also pointed out The Cafe if I wanted and snacks or drinks and that they were all on Bob. The store had a wide selection, very clean and was very well laid out which made it easy to sit on the couches to make sure they were comfortable. Cheryl came over and checked on me when I was sitting on a couch for a second time to see if so had an questions. I told her I wanted to buy the set and the rest was easy as well. Outstanding no pressure customer service, quality of a large selection of furniture, location of store will keep me coming back there for my future furniture needs. There was a very nice finishing touch that the store manager meets everyone before they leave to ask how their experience was. Very nice touch!",

This time we went in person with our now-toddler to choose his bed, and we lucked out finding Ben. He was so helpful, professional and so personable. I hate pushy salespeople and he was the opposite. Which is wonderful because we have a half empty house we just built and will need a lot of furniture over the next few months and next few years, for both the house and our growing family. We look forward to seeing Ben again soon for our next purchase(s). I also love the store s setup, including the candy and ice cream bar. Made a great distraction for our wandering wild child :). I dont really see a need to go anywhere else. We checked out Macy s, where we had previously bought our bed years ago- it looked like they re going out of business, barely anything to look at, meanwhile Bob s has 2 floors chock full of things to see and touch and ideas to get. And the service is just so great. Such a difference from other places. Very happy overall with Bob s and with our salesperson Ben.",

I spent hours in the store and Glen was the most helpful person I ve ever had the pleasure of working with! I kept flip-flopping back and fourth between how I wanted the couch and he was so accommodating and helpful and always had a smile on his face. You can just tell by how he carries himself that he takes pride in what he does and he actually wants to help you. He was able to get it delivered to us quickly and the delivery went great also! We love our couch and will return to Bobs in the future for any other furniture needs we may have.",

Bobs furniture is different the staff was friendly and didnt follow us around. We actually was able to discuss and measure what works for our home. Glen explained to us that Bob is like Costco. They get good prices from their manufacturer that there is no haggling involve so you can walk around the store as long as you want and the prices you see is the lowest and your getting a great price. I did check and compare this is accurate. I was impressed and would go back again. Thank you Glen for great costomer service.",

Whether it was the exorbitant prices, the constant stalking, or the haggling, we never felt comfortable enough to make an informed decision. Then, we made it to Bobs. What a refreshing experience! The showroom floor was neat and organized and the staff very welcoming. Evelyn helped us understand the things that mattered, like materials and density of foams and left us to discover our own preferences. Along the way, she checked in to make sure everything was okay and to check on stock of items we were interested in. In the end, we secured all the furniture we wanted and more at a cost less than we had expected. Evelyn was a massive help and we will definitely return to Bobs to work with her again for our future furniture needs!",

He immediately took action and escalated my concern to Melanie. She was superb in letting me detail what happened and then quickly coming to a resolution to make me a satisfied customer once again. Their interaction restored the trust that I had lost, and l look forward to continued business in the future. Please commend your excellent employees for going above and beyond.",

As soon as I entered the store, I was immediately greeted by the manager (Mike) and he went over some of the store policies since they just reopened this week. The interior of the store was so clean and well sanitized and they limited the number of people inside so my shopping experience was overall great! Heather was the sales representative who assisted me. She was extremely helpful! She literally went above and beyond to assist me with my selections and I left the store ecstatic! Heather, thank you so much for all your help (and your patience)! This is definitely an experience that I won t ever forget. I can t wait for my new furniture to arrive!",

Let me start off by giving you a little background on what led up to me deciding to contact Bobs. Originally I ordered leather living room and family room furniture from Wayfair in August But...was sent an apology email in October (2 months later) that my order had been canceled because the furniture had been discontinued. To No fault of theirs I also received great customer service from Wayfair. So... Im not knocking Wayfair guys but I believe the furniture was coming from Canada plus it had something to do with the issues and problems weve been experiencing with the Cargo Ships not being able to get through. Back to online shopping I went and I decided to give Bobs a call instead. Heather answered the phone and after explaining my situation to her she immediately went to work looking for a replacement for me. Even though what she found was lighter then what I had originally ordered from Wayfair, Heather convinced me to at least let her text me a picture of some Italian Leather Furniture that they had in-stock in their Warehouse in Escondido and guaranteed it would be delivered within one week. After seeing the picture of the furniture that she text to me, I immediately fell in love. Plus, she was able to get me 12-month interest free financing which was a Bonus and sealed the deal for me. I also purchased their Goof Proof Warranty which I highly recommend. After everything was said and done I actually set-up delivery for 2 weeks later because I had to sell my old furniture first. Even the delivery guys were awesome and gave great customer service. They arrived early, set-up my furniture and were very polite and courteous. I was so happy with Bobs customer service guys that I bought an additional Chair and Ottoman for the living room from Heather and set-up in-store pickup from their Long Beach Warehouse. But...somehow this order got mixed-up for in-store pickup in the Escondido Store (1.5 to 2 hours) away. Thats when I had the pleasure of speaking with Junior who called to tell me my chair and ottoman were ready for pickup in the Escondido Store. I explained to Junior that originally I was suppose to pick-up the furniture at their store in Long Beach. Junior immediately spoke with the Store Manager who gave the approval to use an outside delivery service to have the furniture delivered to our home at no additional cost to us. Now Thats Great Customer Service Guys! So...before you shop anywhere else please give Bobs Discount Furniture a Try!",

The Manager Erin ( sorry if misspelled  name) was OUTSTANDING! THE CUSTOMER SERVICE PERFECT. He did not dish out go too statements that are scripted  to say, no sir he was personable and honest. Answered  all of our questions .Give this man a raise!",

After we made our selection he seamlessly completed the transaction and explained the zero interest financing policy that was available. Overall it was a very good experience in a well laid out store that even had ice cream and candy for the kids! The quality and selection of the furniture exceeded my expectations for a discount store. We will return for future furnishings as needed for our new home.",

They have so many options for everyone! Prices are great and the quality is amazing. It took no time for us to be approached by the amazing Annie. She was SO helpful, so sweet, funny, and knowledgeable  - and most importantly she was not pushy AT ALL. I truly felt like I was being helped by a friend and not a sales person. She knew when to let us have space, was quick to get answers, and patient when we needed time to figure out our next steps. We were also assisted by the store manager, a lovely girl Kira in financing, and Joey who was also a manager helped us finish up the paperwork and schedule delivery. Truly everyone we interacted with in the store was a gem and sweet Annie was a genuine dream to work with so be sure to ask for her when you go in! I am now a Bobs fan for life and will return to this location for all of my future furniture needs and send all my friends/family their way too.",

We ended up leaving with a whole new bedroom set, bar stools, end tables, a new set of couches and basically everything else we were going to need for our new home. We were not rushed, or pushed to buy anything we didn t want like the other places. Joana went through everything with us for 4 hours from colors to fabrics to absolutely everything we can think of. it was a truly amazing experience and we will be continuing to go back for years to come.

After a couple phone calls I did get ahold of Sherry at the store and she was awesome as far as Im concerned. Sherry went above and beyond the normal requiremenents of. Sales associate. I recommend Bobs furniture store and the employees very highly.....",

He listen and took me to several couches which Only one I liked but everything has to be either off white ,grey or black yuck !Leather if you wanted brown nope. So we moved on to recliners. We walked around again everything in leather or wrong color. Were now to the end and I turn around and found the recliner of all my wants.Of course it was very upper end and expensive but I was in love with it . So then the bad new wait time 8 - to 10 weeks or longer . Well with so thought and talking We ordered it on store credit but it doesnt kick in till chair is delivered. Meet store manager before leaving ,it was a very pleasant experience ,low key and was happy with Tyler  I highly recommend him and the store .",

The show room is gorgeous, prices reasonable, and the options are amazing! The best part?  Our Sales Associate, Hilary.  She was hilarious the entire time, made it fun and not once did I feel pressure.  She moved here from Ohio, and was so fun to talk to about the area.  She never  hovered  which we all know drives us crazy at the other stores. We walked out super excited about our purchases, which . By the way?  Will be here NEXT WEEK.

They were welcoming and helpful from the moment we walked in until we left. Our waitress was terrific. The ribeye steak was amazing and so was the filet mignon. The carrots, smashed potatoes and brocollini were great and so was the creme brulee. I was also impressed and thankful they ask about allergies and were accommodating. The restaurant is elegant and classy, and I was glad to see them enforce the dress code to even the wealthiest folks who ignored it. If I had any cons it would be that it was loud, and the tables were kind of close. However, this isn t unusual for restaurants during dinner. Overall it was a great experience and we ll be back.",

The kids shared a 16oz filet, it was delicious and well seasoned. They even sliced it into thin strips to make it easier for them. We tried some new to us things from Bobs tonight, My husband got the barratta salad and the shrimp cocktail.  Between the two, I think he really enjoyed the shrimp cocktail.",

Our waiter was Dimitri and he was phenomenal!  Hands down the best waiter we have had anywhere. Food was spectacular! Wagu was to die for - and this carrot cake - superb and so huge (had to take a picture) Definitely recommend for a special occasion or just because!  Highly rating this place :)",

To compare the Plano and McKinney the drinks and food were slightly better in mckinney.   A few years ago bobs in Plano food was great but the last couple of times we have gone has hit or miss.

After finishing up our AMAZING food we went over to the Cigar area where although it was my first time having a Cigar Martin sure knew what to recommend to make it a great experience for my friends and I. All that to say this, I will be coming back!",

We sat at the smoking lounge and had Kelly and Kat as our bartenders and they were so kind and fun! This whole experience has been amazing. If you need a place for date night this is the spot! My favorites were the scallops, lamb chops, and the roasted neuske bacon slices!!! The Cote De Boeuf melted in your mouth! If Im being honest, we kind of ordered a bit of everything to try out. All in all, will definitely be coming back",

Calamari was perfect; my dipping sauce was meh. Got there at 6 on a Tuesday and the bar was full and a few tables.  Finished at 9: the bar thinned out and most tables full.",

My wife and I dined at the bar. The menu is slightly different and seemed a bit pricier than other locations. Not a show stopper, but just an observation. As other reviews state the bartenders are friendly and attentive. Food was on point although a bit slow on arrival. There were no chef specials that evening, growing pains I expect. The entrance hallway is very enticing, but the bar and dining areas seemed a bit off, perhaps a bit too bright. I will probably wait a while for a return visit.",

It was way too loud. It was nice to go outside where it was quieter. We ate from 6:00 to 8:00 PM. It was fun, but very loud! I checked the decibel level and it was 79-94 decibels. The appetizer of fried onion rings was more than ample for our 6. There were 12 of them. The Fried shrimp was awesome. Caesar Salad was very tasty. Filet Mignonette was really good. We did not try desserts as we were full, but they were huge. We saw cake and Icecream. The room was square so sound was amplified. We will give them another try. The price was comparable to other upscale restaurants. 6 Shrimp, a big carrot, massed potatoes and salad was $40. Steak was $50, $60, or $70 for 6, 12, and 16 oz respective. Give them a try!",
