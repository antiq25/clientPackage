The staff at this McDonalds are very friendly & efficient compared to other locations. No fuss delicious hot & freshly prepared food. This is the first time in 15 years I have been served piping hot food to eat. Ideally,, by the time I get to my table, or the food gets brought to me in the car from Drive through, it is cold, the coffee tastes like Luke warm water & the pop is out of Gas. No wonder I hated McDonalds fast food. Believe me I truely enjoyed my meal today. Infact because I really enjoyed my meal today, we sat & also enjoyed Apple pies as an extra treat. I definately recommend all to try out this location, you will never again return to all those problem locations again. Very neat & cleans, no over flowing garbage bins or even a single dirty table, where customers had to clean, before eating their meals. Every single point at this location, was past excellent.

We do take out from here once in a awhile yet the staff r have such great memories that they always say  Hello nice to see u guys again!  ... and it s a really nice vibe when u live in the  big city  and this is obviously a busy corporately owned franchise. They make it feel like a friendly next door eatery despite them being really really busy all the time. Line ups r super fast!! U won t wait around in line even if it s busy bkuz the managers jump in and help to ensure no ones waits long.

It is Nov 13th 2016 in the afternoon. Its not terribly busy, theres 2 floors with the upstairs hosting one of the rare play places, and the service is on point. I walked in, saw the digital ordering kiosks. I love how amazingly powerful they are. Dont forget that you can tap on an order and hit Customize to go crazy with the most granular possible nit picky stuff you can think of.  Today the Build Your Taste burger builder was fully integrated and let me absolutely get the details I wanted. Once the order was complete it got me to pick up an elecronic device known as a Table Tracker, this allowed me to bring my kid upstairs to the play place with my number and pretty close after ordering two gentlemen came upstairs with my order on a wooden paddle, and my daughters happy meal carried separately and carefully. The men asked us if we wanted any condiments, to which we asked for ketchup to which they happily obliged. No restaurant, especially fast food, has evolved over time quite like McDonalds. I though McCafe was a pretty big deal when it came around but now McDonalds seems to be catering to thise who want real food, with real service one could experience at a standard family restaurant.  Except i dont have to wait 35 minutes to an hour gor my order to come about. I imagine it wont be like this all the time, in fact im pretty sure to expect just like what happened to FatBurger. Sure everyones enthusiastic now, give it a month and some change and well be back to old habbits.

This location really needs its own full-time security personnel. She should not have had to handle that on her own, or wait for mall security to arrive.

It often feels a little depressing when you walk in the door and you can see it in the staffs demeanor. One day I walked in for a cold dessert and encountered the bubbliest, happiest, the most joyful employee I have ever encountered. Even with her mask on, I can tell she was smiling ear to ear as she took my order. It felt very welcoming and it was a nice change. The way she would communicate with her coworkers, with so much respect and care, showed me that her demeanor is genuine. The amount of joy she was putting out was radiating throughout the place and I picked up on it. I was having a long day (hence why I came in for the dessert) and she totally changed my mood. Justine is going places and making a lot of people happy in the process. If management sees this review please let Justine know how much of a difference she is making at your location.

I used to get breakfast here a couple of times a week and eventually one of the ladies started recognising me and remembering my order and I would usually just have to confirm between two items that I always ordered. I am now working from home so I no longer go there, but I sometimes miss my little routine and receiving great customer service! Previous review: This is one of the worst locations Ive been to in Vancouver.  There are two women here that are part of the morning crew who give the most horrendous service I have ever experienced and one of them is a supervisor/manager. They dont know how to listen and as a result they get my order wrong...often. Theres nothing complicated about ordering a McMuffin without cheese and two hashbrowns. When I order coffee, they get the size or number of creams wrong. This isnt Starbucks and Im not ordering a complicated drink but somehow a simple cup of coffee gets messed up almost every time. They often ring in my order wrong and I have to repeat myself two or three times before they get it right and they like to argue with me as if Im doing something wrong. I speak perfect English and they seem to as well, but clearly their listening skills are lacking.",a year ago,2022-11-25 06:13:49.118286,,,,3,48,5,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101378747282788679040/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,
