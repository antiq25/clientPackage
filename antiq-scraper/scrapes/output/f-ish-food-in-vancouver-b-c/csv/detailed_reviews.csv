The owner behaved as if he didnt recognize me and even started to challeng me suggesting that the beetles might have even come from inside my house. This is curtomer service?

This is why I chose this restaurant for my birthday brunch with the girls. The food was absolutely delicious (as always) & we had an amazing server who was super attentive. I wish I got his name! One of my friends had a severe garlic allergy and we quickly learned she couldn t have anything on the menu but the oysters. The waiter apologized multiple times but she is very used to that when going out to eat so she was totally unbothered by it. It came as a huge pleasant surprise to us when he brought out a complementary dish from the Chef that she could have! Thank you, Chef! What a service. Lastly thank you so much for the birthday dessert. That creme brulee was delicious!

Clam chowder was clammy with a hint of bacon. Steak tartare is my favourite dish and it did not disappoint. For mains, we ordered the shortrib with risotto and kale, and the seafood ciopinno. Shortrib was by far the best thing Ive had. Oh, we also got the brussel sprouts on the side, which were fried up and salty.

The steak tartare is excellent and serving was fresh and quite big with 4 pieces of garlic home made toast and side salad.

The food was even more disappointing. I ordered the seafood platter, expecting a delicious assortment of fresh seafood. What I got was a plate of overcooked, rubbery, and tasteless seafood that was clearly not fresh. It was as if they had pulled it out of the freezer and microwaved it. To add insult to injury, the prices were exorbitant for the low-quality food and service we received. It felt like a complete rip-off, and I left feeling like I had wasted my hard-earned money on a subpar dining experience. I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.

The place was very accommodating about letting us move our reservation up a bit from when we originally set it. The place is very beautiful, well decorated and very elegant yet cozy. We sat on the enclosed patio and the temperature was perfect, not to mention the ivy covered lanterns giving soft romantic light to the room. We were given a hand written congratulations from the restaurant, which was a very sweet personal touch. Our server, Phillip, was engaging, charming, and was very well versed on the menu. Any question he couldnt answer he was quick to ask the kitchen. He also checked in with us all night and was constantly refilling our waters. It was a very royal treatment we did not expect at that price point, for certain. We got the two tier seafood platter, the scallops entre, and a beef tenderloin to split. Not only were they very attentive to my dairy allergy, and my wifes peanut allergy, but everything we tried exceeded our expectations. Never had jellyfish before here and I would for certain try it again. The oysters were fresh and absolutely something I was excited for as an oyster lover, I was not disappointed. In terms of accessibility Id say very for a wheelchair, but I was having a good day so walked in with my cane. The parking is subject to downtown and I didnt see a disabled spot, but that doesnt mean they arent there. Likely just filled before we got there. However they do offer valet services. They are very accommodating if you call ahead. Definitely recommend this place to seafood lovers looking for a nice elegant date spot.

I had booked a reservation at Blue Water Cafe back when I was visiting Vancouver in April based on a friend s recommendation and it did not disappoint. As soon as we entered we were greeted warmly by the hostess and were shown to our tables. We came on a Friday night and the restaurant was packed, but that added to the ambiance. The restaurant has a beautiful interior with a more semi casual to semi formal dress code. We were seated by the sushi preparation station, which was great as we could see the food being prepared. The restaurant has one of the most extensive wine menus and the sommelier assisted us in ordered the correct bottle that would go with our taste preferences and the meal we were getting. As for the food we decided to opt for the Blue Water Cafe Tower (the signature three tier) and were going to order more food, but the server suggested we first start with that to see if it s enough food as usually the tower is good for 4-6 people and there was only 2 of us. I appreciated the honesty as then we did not over order and had to pack food for take away. The tower arrived shortly after and it was huge. Each tier had plenty of seafood options and every single item on the tower was fantastic. The seafood was very fresh and the flavours they used helped to compliment the seafood and not over power it s flavour. We spent about an hour picking away at it and by the end we were stuffed as there was plenty of food. We had decided to end the meal with their creme brulee and some espresso and tea. Overall, this restaurant was one of my favourites in Vancouver and although it can be pricey at $150-200 per person (with drinks), it is well worth it as you are getting high quality seafood and great service. You could also come and get the smaller towers and other dishes as they are cheaper and look just as great.

Best sushi and sashimi in the city, and if you get a chance to sit at the sushi bar it is always fun to watch the masters at work.

Ordered all of the daily oysters and I thought that it all tasted super fresh. This place also had one of the best sablefish I have ever tried. The fish was so soft and melted right into my mouth. The wagyu flat iron was also super juicy. Wasn t a huge fan of the sauce it came with however you don t really need sauce when it comes to waygu. Tried out a few of the unsung hereos 2023 menu options as well. Tried the Uni carbonara and I personally thought that it was okay. Tried the herring creme brulee and thought it was alright as well.

They also have very neat cocktails that I recommend trying. Seafood tower: this came with a great variety of seafood and ceviche. The seafood were all very fresh and definitely worth the money. There s other options to get just one tier or seafood tasting so there s something at every price point and preference. Dungeness crab roll and sable fish aburi: both tasted extremely good, highly recommend both rolls. Smoke salmon terrine: this tasted okay to me, the smoked salmon flavor was not very strong Pork cheek: one of my favourite dishes of the night, it is super tender and I enjoyed the combination of flavor and texture with the cauliflower and hazelnuts underneath Kobe style short ribs: it tasted like elevated stewed beef. The flavor was good and the vegetables paired well Sablefish: the most average dish of the night. We got it because it was well reviewed but I found it to be nothing special.

The patio also provided interesting & colourful atmosphere as you get to subtlety people-watch, and a few small scenes unfolded that Blue Water Cafe staff handled with finesse and class! Kudos to the entire staffs discreet and compassionate approach to the poor guy behind us whos date walked out on him and a mouth-watering 3 tier seafood tower! I loved gazing around the patio area and greenery, and savouring the very enjoyable company of my man on a very memorable trip. Our server, Chris, was one of the most personable, knowledgeable and passionate-about-his craft professionals I have encountered in many years. He has a very warm, likeable approach and drops some great one-liners while answering our questions about the menu, offering his recommendations, and even delving into the Toptable ownership story that my bf is quite familiar with and avidly follows. On Chriss mention, we ended up visiting Thierrys (their chocolate/cafe) the next day for an espresso and a pastry.

She provided excellent service, we felt taken care of from beginning to end, she is very knowledgeable about the menu and she made this experience exceptional for us.

I am from France and I can testify it was excellent Sole Meuniere) Everything is cooked to perfection, very flavourful. We also had desserts on our 2nd dinner and once again they were delicious and using top quality ingredients (valrhona chocolate for the dark chocolate cake!) Saturday was a busy night and you can tell that everybody is synchronized, all the staff is very professional and their system is well thought of which results in guests receiving an impeccable service. Special mention regarding the communication between the staff. On Sunday (2nd dinner) our server Chris already knew we had come the day before and what we had for food and drinks, one more way to make us feel special.

The sushi bar in a typical Japanese restaurant has a fridge that separates the customers from the sushi chef. As a results, it feels like youre sitting at a high top but without much sushi making to watch. Not so at the Bluewater sushi bar. The design was well thought out. The customers actually sit a little higher than the sushi work surface. The sushi fridge is either behind the chefs or below the counter. We had an extremely enjoyable evening watch five sushi chefs produce an amazing number of sushi and sashimi dishes for a full restaurant. When we eat sushi, the temperature of the fish really matter to us. So, we like the fact that our hamachi sashimi is not frozen, but still cold and firm enough. We are glad that we ordered gradually so that our raw food does not come at once only to quickly deteriorate before we can consume it all. Unlike some sushi bars, we had a wait person who took our orders and provided excellent service. When part of an order is waiting for another items, the plate is placed behind the chefs next to a vertical freezer, so we can still have some visual enjoyment. This sushi bar is not part of the increasing trend in Vancouver Japanese restaurants which provide a set menu with omakases and we love Bluewater for keeping it this way as we are particular in what we choose and when we want to eat each piece. Although the restaurant was full that night, it was not insanely noisy at the sushi bar.

Everything was fantastic, from the service, the food, and the ambiance. The sablefish and the seafood tasting for 2 were the most memorable dishes. Highly recommend to make reservations. They pride themselves in being sustainable, so thats a plus Food- 5 stars Seafood tasting for 2- Im so glad our server convinced us to give this a try. Very elegantly plated and I loved how each plate had a different flavor profile and was ordered perfectly. Highly recommend Halibut- the halibut was good, but slightly disappointed that the fish was slightly overcooked. The sauce masked the slightly overcooked fish, but it was still pretty good Sablefish- this was phenomenal. Cooked perfectly and enjoyed each and every bite. Will come back to get this from now on Warm dark chocolate cake and greek yoghurt cheesecake- both desserts were pretty good. They were standard desserts. Done well but not as memorable as the dishes listed above Service- 5 stars Our server was fantastic. Excellent service throughout and loved his recommendations and honesty Bottom Line This was my by far my favorite restaurant in Vancouver.

The dressing and small cuts of veggies did well to complement and complete the lobster roll. Truffle fries were well seasoned, being able to get hints of truffle (presumably from truffle oil) every other bite or so. The aioli paired well with the fries as well. Fish tacos were fresh, the flavor and texture of the coleslaw went well to balance out the grease of a fried fish fillet. I probably could have gone for another order but didnt want to risk a permanent food coma. One set of oysters tasted more of the ocean than the other. Going by what the wait staff pointed out as the regular vs premium, the latter had the more ocean-y briney taste. Not for everyone especially if you arent a fan of seafood, but if you dabble then these are definitely worth a try at a reasonable price. All in all, we were thoroughly impressed with all aspects of our visit. It is on our very short list of places wed definitely revisit on our next stop in Vancouver!",2 months ago,2023-09-22 01:12:52.276223,,,,0,31,26,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100169195546801024988/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

Our server was nice, quick, and knowledgeable on the menu. She mentioned the uni was firm and that made me go for it (Ive had some bad experiences with this delicacy). It was delicious. Ordered many different dishes - Sun Seeker, Sweet Select, and Kumamoto oysters were all delicious and fresh. One of them were very meaty. The horseradish is freshly grated. Lobster poutine was packed with lobster but pretty meh overall. Crab cake was a bit dry. 6pc scallop was seared to perfection. The tuna tartare was a bit salty, but still tasted good. The octopus was amazing and tender. And of course as mentioned earlier, the uni was the best and most fresh Ive ever had. The wife says they make an amazing espresso martini.

We were here for the happy hours fresh oysters. Turned out all other food from the regular menu were fantastic too. Oysters were fresh but Cherry claims too sweet. (May be not in season yet).

I tried a bunch of stuff from their menu (oysters, sablefish collars, croquettes, lobster roll, mussels and clams, and the fish tacos). Overall most things were very good and everything tastes super fresh. I would say the stand outs were the premium oysters (the day I went it was I believe Sandunes PEI), fish tacos and the mussels & clams. I thought the lobster roll was a bit light on the lobster and the collars needed a bit more sauce, but overall everything is very high quality The staff is also extremely nice, and the interior is very cool. This spot definitely gives you a taste of the PNW, and has many things to try. It is fun to go with friends and get a few things to share.

We ordered the paella for 2, the grilled oysters, some raw oysters, and the fish tacos. The paella was visually striking with all its colours, and had tons of seafood!

The portion size was great too, we got a paella for 2 and split it between 3 people, and it was more than enough (although we each ordered some oysters as well). I really liked the grilled oysters as well, but my favourite part of the meal has to be the fish tacos. The fish was perfectly fried, and paired perfectly with the pickled onion and the mango aioli. These were by far the most delicious tacos Ive ever eaten, and I would come back just for them. Overall I thought the service was professional and the dining environment was nice as well.

Not the biggest fan of the sauce they used (I typically like my fish a bit more plain), but it was not poured heavily and soaked into the Salmon which I appreciated, was just a bit on top of the Salmon and on the bottom of the dish (as seen in the photo) . You are able to order a side of Salmon here as an addition to your meal which a different restaurant said was not possible. I like that the option is available here.

Really enjoyed the seafood hot pot and halibut cake from the dine out menu. Presentation of the halibut cake was ok but it tastes fabulous. The tartar sauce was just right not too sweet to help compliment the savoury cake. The seafood hot pot has a tad of spiciness to it and gave it an extra kick. The seafood chowder and seafood linguine from the all day menu were also very palatable. The seafood chowder is also slightly spicy which I thoroughly enjoyed but it might not be for everyone, especially those who do not enjoy spicy food. Only the cheesecake dessert from the dine out menu was a let down. Cheesecake itself is already quite heavy and combining with a thick chocolate fudge topping is over the top. *Been back here a few times already.

My partner had the burger and it also tasted fine. Fries may have been better with an aioli rather than just ketchup. The service was exceptional. It seemed every table had their own server which I feel made it more personable rather than subtly noticing your server giving another table a different experience. Great choice in that strategy! It was noticed and appreciated. The white house wine is delicious. Like crisp apple. Loved it! And, location right on the pier to smell the water outside. Lovely decor and lighting.

And to top it off it was served on a wonderful display of, to put it in non foodie cuisine lingo, potato leek soup. For those not so adventurous, the halibut fish and chips that my wife ordered was some of the best Ive ever eaten as well as the cod bites that my 5 year old loved! The tartar sauce was the best tartar sauce Ive ever had to the point where I asked the waitress for the recipe, to which she was able to give me the ingredients and I still swear theres a hint of coconut somewhere in the recipe.

They have a large screen TV just like the Richmond location.   Wife and I actually like the Richmond location layout better and we sort of made up our mind that the Richmond location was better until the food came.  Staff was friendly right as we were sitting down, but then got a bit slow until ordering. We got our standard order of king crab and this one was just a little over 9lb.  Kids dont eat seafood so we had to order them the sizzling beef which they loved.  The crab was cooked in two ways and we ordered the same styles as the other location for a true comparison.   Last time was 8lb, but this one extra lb made a huge difference in the legs.  We didnt get the fried rice as we could never finish with it.  Got a bottle of white wine as usual.   But its a bit expensive comparing to if you were to buy it at a store direct. The entire meal was most excellent and we couldnt finish the body, but also expected for the size.  We actually finished everything else.  Also gave the corn juice a try.  It was interesting, thats all Ill say about that.

The server was always pleasant, and was quick and attentive. Honestly, he probably made the experience a 5, as often, the service in Chinese restaurants are sub par from Western culture but almost expected. He was really ok it! And the food. Oh, man, the food.

We ordered a bit of everything, and everything was good!  The fried cod and Salmon had a crunchy batter, and the fish was very fresh.  The fish was served on a bamboo basket filled with fresh fries that were crunchy, and a really big serving.  The tar tar sauce and the slaw was very good too, but the cod was really good with ketchup as well. The tuna wrap was tasty, the flavors were very balanced, and enhanced the freshness and sweetness of the tuna. All in all, we ate too much, but we will be going back.

It has more than 30 restaurants across Canada in different cities. There are five locations in the Great Vancouver area. I have been to the two locations before: one is on Robson St. Downtown and another one is on Kingsway Vancouver. Both of the locations served quite delicious seafood. Very enjoy eating at Captain Boil. Captain Boil Kingsway Location is at 3309 Kingsway, Vancouver, BC V5R 5K6. The same as Robson St. location, is a super busy street in Vancouver. Many restaurants are on the street. Such a great location to open a restaurant on this street. I have been to this location twice with my friends and fiances. The first time was all you can eat Mussels night. The second time was lunch combo. For all you can eat Mussels dinner, three of us had 2lbs mussels each plus fries. It was awesome. The big plastics bags were full of fresh seafood. Yummy! Captain Boil s Lunch combo is another great combination. Fish or Chicken Teriyaki with rice with Seafood Assortments (2 Crawfish, 2 Mussels, 2 Shrimps, and 2 Clams). The total is only $13, which is such a great deal. Super hot rice with teriyaki sauce on top is super delicious.

(~$15) Its hard to find a place that does gluten free batter and also have a seperate fryer for that. Cod was very fresh, the batter is crispy, yet light and not oily. The one piece portion is actually quite filling even it looks small in the picture. (Also comes with alot of fries). Good condiments: A slice of fresh lemon, container of gourmet tartar sauce (likely made inhouse?), and things you can request like ketchup, hot sauce, malt vinegar.  Hot sauce seems homemade too. Chips are more like north american style fries, the shoestring kind. I would be having a thicker cut if I had fish and chips where its a native dish (UK/NZ/OZ), so the chips here were so-so for me, but still warm and fresh... Just feels greasier because of this cut. Luckily theres some very refreshing coleslaw on the side and I really enjoyed that. I think it had cabbage and kale in it. I also tried their clam chowder, also gluten free. It was very hearty and you could tell there are wasnt any artificial flavouring, the flavour was just powered by alot of clams and celery/carrot/potato base.  The portion is quite small but it was a nice side to have (~$7).  Its not cream based, just very tender potatoes that are driving the thickness. There is a counter for buying fresh fish and fish patties, and local artisanal condiments.  The people working are very friendly.  Highly recommended for a quick bite, its about 7 mins wait only.",a year ago,2022-11-22 01:13:34.892730,"Thank you very much for the positive and detailed review, it really helps us.

Came inside on Saturday afternoon (face mask required) and was immediately greeted by an employee, super friendly and efficient, he took our orders: Two piece halibut, and 2 piece salmon, and we picked up a couple of beverages from a well-stocked fridge on the side. The restaurant side is relatively small, with sitting available for 6 people, but we were lucky and found ourselves a couple of seats. After about 10 minutes our order was brought to us, it was amazing! I opened my compostable container and found 2 huge pieces of halibut in a bed of french fries and a scoop of cold slaw. The fish was thick and tasty, the batter gold and crispy, deep fried to perfection... fries cut small, perfect size... cold slaw tangy and super fresh. Order came with a container with tartar sauce and catsup. After the halibut, I tried a piece of salmon, presented exactly as the first, and equally tasty and crispy!

Before, we mainly went to Fanny Bay to feed the craving for oysters but decided to try Rodneys one day, and theres no coming back. Upon our first arrival, the place was bustling, and we were seated at the bar, which was something new for us at an oyster joint. Jumping ahead, I can tell that the bar seating is the only one we accept visiting Rodneys since then. At first, I was a bit irritated with the service but turned out we came there right at the change of shifts, and everything was fixed pretty quickly. Ive heard from many people that they dont like the atmosphere here because the staff reminds them of a fraternity. I have to disagree with that. I think that the mood created by the team with their witty behavior and high energy creates one of a kind experience no one else can offer. Thats why seating at the bar is the best spot available if you ask me. After all, I dont find oysters to be fancy food like many dining places trying to make it, so I think that a more straightforward and friendlier atmosphere suits it much better. The variety of oysters is pretty amazing, and its always the freshest and best product out there. And its hard to beat their Low Tide deals for oysters and drinks.

They have the local Granville Island Ale/Lager on tap, no doubt from the brewery right across the street-- the ale was well-balanced: not too hoppy, not too malty, and a great complement to the fish and chips. If you get anything here, get the seafood platter, which is a little of everything plus some garlic butter sauce. I dont know if the chef went to the nearby culinary school, but if she did, it certainly shows. The food was fantastic: perfectly seasoned, neither over- nor under-done.

I had the Hokkaido Scallops with home made squash tortellini,  sage burn butter sauce, toasted walnuts. The scallops were cooked to perfection and everything else on the plate was wonderful too. If I could have licked the plate clean, I would have. Also the wine recommendation was spot on. We had a California white called Lieu Dit from the Santa Maria Valley.

He handled the situation well and I certainly appreciated his call and his willingness to hear my feedback. I ve changed my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars. Original Review: I ve been coming to Chewies for years, mostly on Sundays. I ve recently been back after COVID. Our  experience was less than optimal. The food was great all around, however the service was not great in the slightest. It took close to ten minutes for someone to come over. Once they did, we placed our order, but from there, we constantly had to ask for obvious things. More water, another drink, new fork, the bill, etc. Our entire time was spent trying to flag down the server to either order additional items or ask for common things. Not intuitive or on top of it at all. We also came at a time in which there were limited tables in the restaurant. The server probably had one or two tables to look out for. Disappointing. Chewies has always been a favourite destination, especially in Kits, because, you can head for a walk down the beach after your meal.",2 years ago,2021-11-22 01:14:15.880261,"Hello Nicholas, I apologize for the delay in getting back to you. First and foremost I would like to extend my appreciation for the support for Chewies over the past. My name is Jamie and I am the owner. Very rarely do I reply to the comments, but this one I felt it necessary. A post like this is obviously a double edged sword. I appreciate the fact that you have been a long time supporter, and the food was great, but the issue with the service is concerning. As I have always tried to stress to our service staff, service first, anything else second. It has been a very trying time since things have reopened. There is a definite lack of staff both FOH, and BOH which has made things even more complicated. By no means am I trying to make any excuses, and I would like to know exactly what time and when it happened (assuming it was on the Sunday, Aug 2nd). But just wanted to clarify. I/we take pride in our service and to have this happen is concerning. I would like to offer you a GC on us as a thank you for bringing this up, but more so an apology for your experience.

When I walked in my mouth dropped until an employee said hello lol. I have problems with every fish store I ve ever been to because of quality, disease/parasites, bad employees, etc, but NOT THIS PLACE I came in for some stuff for my betta because I did a fish in cycle (tank was barren), and left with 4 beautiful and cute red cherry shrimp (cheapest I ve found in Van and great quality), a couple bundles of moss, and two long grass like plants. No sign of disease, high quality supplies/fish, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and the care of the tanks were immaculate! Lots of the tanks had GORGEOUS aquascapes (good for inspiration), and I was met at the door by a pond of goldfish (lovely touch, a little overstocked but they take such good care of the tanks/water it s not a problem). I also saw a cute turtle, and lots of saltwater supplies/fish, all in great condition. I also saw a few enclosures for reptiles I assume, and they looked very natural and well put together (I know nothing about reptiles, but the enclosures looked very nice). I have to give these guys a full 5 stars because I ve NEVER seen such a well kept fish store in my life (I used to breed fish and I ve kept fish for almost my whole life). I could go on forever about how amazing this place is, everyone who has fish NEEDS to go here sometime!!!! I couldn t find a single fish that looked sick, all plants were high quality, a few discounts around the store for bulk buying, all in all they ACED what a pet store should strive to be.

I got my beloved bearded dragon here. My lizard is a delight. The shopkeepers here care for the animals well, and get them acclimated to people calmly and compassionately. Dropping in, Id often see them with a chameleon or a chinchilla on their shoulder, getting the animal used to chilling with them. I have since moved away, so I cant go here anymore for my pet supplies.

It is my brother s favourite place, but it has been a while for me since I no longer live nearby. Not only did the food exceed our expectations, so did the service. I had the smoked sablefish, which was accompanied by a huge portion of veggies. It was a good portion, and super well plated. Others had the New York steak, cedar planked salmon, the salmon Wellington, and rack of lamb. Everyone was super happy with their meals. We also ordered the calamari starter, which was very fresh! The meal came with their complimentary warm bread and lobster oil, which was divine. The star was our server. The lone man appeared to be working the entire restaurant alone. Serving, taking orders, and even bartending. He didn t skip a beat, and I was blown away. He deserves 5 stars and a big raise/bonus!

The broth had just the right amount of spicy kick (for a non spicy eater) and had plenty of vegetables as well. Save some of the bread to dip in the broth My kids had the calamari and a kids pasta with veggie medley in a tomato sauce. Calamari was done with a light batter and fried to the right amount of crispy. The veggie medley was spectacular loaded with broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, peppers, and a tiny bit of apparatus stalks. My parents had the salmon wellington and the daily chef creation (peppercorn crusted halibut). Salmon Wellington is highly recommended and highly recommend it to share.

The food and service are stars here. You can tell dishes have been thoughtfully developed and put together by a master, forwarding quality and taste. Yes, the portions are huge, which is surprising given the ingredients. And the flavours! Was expecting the linguine to be watery and mediocre (like at Joe Fortes), but the sauce was fresh, garlicky, rich, perfectly reduced, and delectable. The mashed potatoes are dangerously addictive. We were all very happy with what we ordered. The gentleman who served us is a true professional. It was such a treat to experience his service. Humorous and gracious, he took extra care without a blink splitting a main and preparing our dad s birthday cake for us. Because we all drove, we opted not to order drinks. Most staff at restaurants at this price point would be annoyed by this and it would show. But not here. The tableware and linens were clean. The decor is dark and vintage, but adds a cozy feel. The bathrooms are humble, but also clean. The room is medium sized and the music is not too loud or trying to force a mood. We went at 5:30 and stayed til about 7/7:30 and it was very pleasant, attentive, and calm throughout. This place is simply about good food and unpretentious service that still makes you feel special and cared for.

There were giant pieces of scallop and prawn which was so satisfying to see. Again, the pasta lasted us another meal as well. Service was A+ too. Not snooty, welcoming and cozy atmosphere.

The had ordered two tartars but I wasnt a big fan of it. Wasnt anything special. Arctic char was on special, we had ordered 3 plates of it and man were they delicious. Monk fish was fantastic. The mango salsa that accompanied it was perfect. West coast bouillabaisse was disappointing.

Ours came on a plate and the crab was delicious. Loved the lotus roots that were perfectly cooked. The corn was a bit bland  but just soaked it up in the sauce (we went mild which was just enough spice). Yes, the shrimps comes w head on and there s no cutlery aside from the seafood cracker.

It has more than 30 restaurants across Canada in different cities. There are five locations in the Great Vancouver area. I have been to the two locations before: one is on Robson St. Downtown and another one is on Kingsway Vancouver. Both of the locations served quite delicious seafood. Very enjoy eating at Captain Boil. Captain Boil Robson St. Location is at 1487 Robson St, Vancouver, BC V6G 1C1. The location is on the one of busiest st downtown Vancouver. There are many restaurants on this street, attract so many customers. I had lunch with my friend at this location. we had a great experience there. We arrived at the restaurant around 12 pm when it just opened. So, the restaurant was not busy. Since it s on the weekend, it didn t serve the lunch combo. We decided to order seafood separately. We ordered Shrimps, Mussels, and Snow Crab legs 1lb each with Cajun, Captain s Boil and Garlic sauces. All the seafood we ordered comes in the arrival of the mains, not on plates, but straight out of the boiling pot with flavors added, delivered to the table still steaming hot in big (biodegradable)  clear-plastic bags!  Mussels are my most favorite dish in this place. They are big and very great quality.",4 years ago,2019-11-22 01:14:35.092288,,,,3,275,2166,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108120370368734168830/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

The medium spicy Captains boil sauce on a pound of shrimp plus a corn add-on was very tasty.  Spice level was perfect for me, and the shrimp was not overcooked. Seafood fried rice was good and was a big portion that would have been plenty to share as a side for several people. I wound up putting some of the sauce with the juices from the shrimp from the bag on the rice, and its a shame that most people will waste it (would be nice if there could be some comp bread for this).  Service was very friendly. Only open for about a month, so Im giving them some slack on running out of the clams that I was looking forward to getting.  Im sure they will work that out as they go along or maybe just everyone wanted clams today.  Place was comfy.  Only thing is that there isnt always real dishware.  Water comes in disposable plastic cups instead of glasses or even reusable plastic cups, and the pop is just served in the can. But the rice came on a real plate with a metal spoon. I didnt use the plastic bib (though did use paper napkins tucked in my shirt) and gloves to try to cut down on the plastic waste but everyone else in the place did.

We were hesitant about the Picatta but its a best seller and was very flavorful. Scallops again are exceptionally delicious but a smaller serving as was the burratta.

We don t drink alcohol so we had to use those glasses whole evening. I really liked the smoked salmon toast and asked for another one, but second time the toast itself was badly burnt. But Richard made things right by saying that he was sorry and we won t be charged for this one, he also offered to bring some bread so we could trade it with burnt toast, thanks!

Hands down some of the best crab cakes I ve eaten in Vancouver. We then shared a fish and chips for the main course. Wow! I m Australian and haven t found a place that makes fish and chips like the motherland until now. The batter was cooked to perfection, not too heavy and I really loved that they had two fish to select from. Huge shout out to the General Manager Dan for making our date night so special. I was surprised that a GM would personally serve our table but that is the vibe Papi s provides. It s not too big. You don t feel like a number.

Went last night and sat at a sunny, safe table on the patio. Rebecca was our great waitress. Sampled some oysters and tuna tataki, happy hour wine. Nice first date in a long time. Best patio location. The menu has improved quite a bit since it was Beach Bay Cafe. Limited wine selection though, its either red or white. They have a delicious cocktail called a Sea Wall Banger that is wildly refreshing. He had the fish and chips and was well impressed. I had the kale, quinoa summer beet salad and it was scrumptious.

We visited the live seafood next door where we were keen to try the sea urchins. However, they don t cut the sea urchins for you so I decided it was too much hassle to cut it myself.

ChIJLW6Oi85zhlQRN_iNocCv7Ak,The Lobster Man,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM1c1lYTmJREAE, ,5,"Live lobster, crab, and oysters are often considered some of the best options for seafood enthusiasts for several reasons: 1. Freshness: Live seafood is the epitome of freshness. When you order live lobster, crab, or oysters, you can be confident that youre getting seafood at its peak quality and flavor. 2. Flavor: Live seafood tends to have a more delicate and succulent flavor compared to seafood that has been frozen or stored for an extended period. The natural sweetness of these creatures is best preserved when they are alive until just before cooking. 3. Texture: The texture of live lobster and crab is exceptional. When cooked properly, the meat is tender, juicy, and full of natural juices, making it a delightful dining experience. Oysters, on the other hand, are prized for their unique texture and briny, oceanic taste. 4. Interactive Dining: Theres an interactive aspect to dining on live seafood. Preparing and cracking open a lobster or crab can be a fun and engaging experience, perfect for social gatherings and special occasions. It s really fun dining experience here in lobster man. Especially thank staff Sean. He provided exceptional service. He was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. Sean went above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was enjoyable.

Over the last few months Ive been building a 55 gallon aquarium for my 21-year old Red Eared Slider. Every employee there is really knowledgeable about aquarium care. Although I wasnt there to buy fish, the principles are all pretty much the same for my turtle, and I was able to get all the necessary decorations, chemicals, and materials to make the perfect home for my turtle. I also ordered my aquarium stand from them at a great price compared to other stores, and they hand-delivered it to me within the week! I felt particularly grateful for that, because I did not have the strength to carry that item myself, and I was already a bit stressed about that. They took the worry right out of my hands. Not to mention...it was free! I also had one of the employees teach me about improving the flora in my aquarium, and advised me on some good decorations that would not just be pretty, but support the health of the tank. Since Ive done the recommendations, my tank is healthier than it has ever been, and it requires less maintenance compared to before. Every time I go into the store I learn a bunch of new things!

The kaleidoscopic variety of species showcased was a testament to the meticulous curation undertaken by the stores proprietors. Their dedication to sourcing exotic species from distant aquatic domains is evident, as evidenced by the unique assortment of freshwater creatures on display.

Theyre colouring up quite nicely in my tank over this last week. I was originally getting my order shipped via courier to Victoria, but then they contacted me to let me know that around once a month they make a trip themselves to the island (Naniamo, Duncan, Victoria), and that if I wanted to wait a couple days I could skip paying the shipping fee (which was actually significantly cheaper than what I had seen from competitors in the first place). Fantastic, I bought a couple plants with the money saved, which also were healthy.

Sadly, we don t see a lot of this these days. All the staff were really friendly and helpful especially Darrin.  He was a real kind and honest guy, very knowledgeable and gave us many helpful tips. We were originally going to purchase a used tank, but Darrin convinced us that there are risks if you don t know how old or if there were ever any issues with disease etc Fortunately they just happened to have the tank we wanted in stock, so while we ended up paying a bit more for the new tank, it was definitely worth it for the piece of mind. With Darrin s advice, he made it a super easy decision for us to purchase our first aquarium!  He also gave us many suggestions on what we can use to put together in our new aquarium.  Our little guy even received beautiful shells as a keepsake!   I m quite pleased with how it turned out!

Aprils is THE go-to place for all of your aquatics needs. They always go above and beyond with their aquatics care and maintenance, and just as importantly, their customer service. Whether it s the in-store visits or home deliveries of online orders, I am always shopping with this store because I ve never had this high level of customer experience with any other aquarium stores. I m always profound by the inventory of aquascape supplies and rare species of freshwater dwellers every time I visit their webpage and their Marine Drive location. Aprils was the reason why I got heavily into this newfound passion for fishkeeping as the young fry I was to the hobby and will always be the main part of my aquatics journey. I met the store owner, Darrin Stewart, at the shop who always engages with each and every person stopping in and I recently found out that he is always the one personally delivering my orders. This speaks a lot about how important it is to them that everyone who shops with April s is always extremely satisfied with their products and service.

I dont know if it seats more than a dozen people, but I am glad I was one of them last week. Top class fresh oysters, usually 6-7 varieties to choose from. The raw shucked are outstanding - the shucker is a master. We had 2 dozen raw and each was a work of shucking art - each oyster perfectly separated from its shell, undamaged in any way. And with the liquor intact. That is some skill. Hats off! Oh, and the homemade chili-vodka condiment? Inspired! The fried oysters were big meaty west coasters, perfectly crispy, juicy.

Husband got the regular fish (we re assuming cod) which was also delicious and cheaper than halibut. He got the chowder with his combo which lacked salt but was an easy fix and would be good for those trying to be mindful of their salt intake.

Simple, no-frills and value. $5.50 for a hamburger with fries, cheapest in the city. You can t even get a quarter pounder at McDonalds for that price. The burger s patty is real beef, unlike McDonald s. The fish and fries are freshly fried right in front of you, and the batter is perfectly crispy and fresh is tender. The fries aren t salted, so make sure to salt them at home. I would love to try the halibut, but they ve been out the 3 times I ve been there. ~$30 for 10 pieces of fish + 3 fries, coleslaw, and gravy is such a good deal! Customer service is great, two or three Cantonese speaking aunties work there, they ve been running for 20-30 years. They tried to talk to my friend and I with our limited Cantonese/Mandarin skills.

But this is a lesson in don t judge with eyes alone. For a very reasonable price, you will enjoy a decent 2 piece fiah and chips without much to complain about. We were impressed that the fish was lightly battered, and not greasy or thick with dough. For this price, I was afraid that it was going to be a treasure hunt searching for the fish in the batter. In fact ours was not even  pre-battered . I saw with my eyes   four fresh fillets being coated and dropped into the fryer! The fries were good too. We forgot to grab some salt, but still good enough to munch down every crumb. There is little to be impressed by visual distractions, but I feel this is a secret for some of the best cheap eats in West Coast dinner food, and if you take a momment to chat to the owners, it is made up in delightful character.",a year ago,2022-11-22 01:15:34.980141,"Wow, thank you very much.

Its understandable that some menu items wouldnt be available due to the freshness of the food so we didnt get a chance to try their crab cakes or clam chowder.

This is the type of place you see in movies where the small local fish restaurant has one chef and two waitresses who know the local patrons by name and their usual orders. My favorite dish on the menu is their fish burger. If you re a fan of blackened fish or focaccia bread this menu item is for you. I ve had both the salmon and red snapper options and I ve been impressed every time. The fish is always cooked to perfection and the focaccia bread *chef kiss* The fries are also always crispy and fresh which just competes the dish. Make sure to get some of their tarter sauce on side because it s the perfect blend of creamy and tart.

Good shampoo selection and its easy to tie your dog up in the tub. The dryer air is not warm as someone stated which is good since dogs actually overheat easily and shouldnt be dried with hot air.

They have seafood that is raw and ready to cook as well as foods that have already been assembled and may just need a bit of time in the oven or on the stove before its ready to eat. (eg. Crab Cakes,Truffle Spot Prawn Mac n Cheese) To celebrate the launch of their fall seasonal menu, Fresh Ideas Start Here was offering a small bowl of complimentary seafood congee to the first 50 customers who came into their store and mentioned the word halibut. Wed never tried this seafood congee before, but apparently its a cult favourite so we went to the store right when it opened and managed to bring home some of this famed seafood congee. Oh wow! This seafood congee exceeded my expectations. I totally understand now why its a cult favourite. It was packed with seafood. They dont skimp on ingredients at this place. According to the stickers stuck onto our containers, a small congee is normally $6 and a large congee is normally $8. I would absolutely go back and pay to have this seafood congee again! Im so happy that its Fall now. With hot summer days leaving, and cooler weather arriving, we should definitely have a reason to go back for the seafood congee!

Just checked their site and doesnt look like its offered anymore, which would be shame, would have definitely come back for the congee alone! Also had 3 customized regular poke bowls, no complaints. The fish was so fresh and we enjoyed some of their more unique toppings, like the ginger-y squid salad. Great sauces to compliment the fish! I snagged a couple of their onigiri left from the grab-and-go section, also fair in size with a mildly spicy cooked tuna flavour. Perfect for a snack or lunch/dinner accompaniment.

I normally come here in the summer for salmon and when the time is right spot prawns and they dont disappoint. A lot of traffic (as you can see from the other posts) are mostly commenting on fish and chips and their other cooked food. Again, its just a portion of what they do. The fish and chips are solid and the batter is not too thick. Got takeout and ate it 20 minutes later and was still crispy. Recommend calling the order in , especially if its getting close to lunch time as there is a high school close by and it can get crowded. People talk about the fries and they are good. For value and quantity, it definitely hits the spot. Also tried the curries eggplant halibut wrap. It was good. Maybe a bit mild for my tastes but for those wanting that light curry flavour with their fish, this would work for you.

ChIJmzoD951zhlQR6AkoOXT34r4,Finest At Sea,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR5Nm9TS2JREAE,David Saucedo,5,"I love this place but keep in mind it is expensive. If you live in the area(Closer to North Van, Alot of homes in the area cost well over 2 Million) then you probably earn enough to not have to worry as much about your budget. But thats besides my point I live in Surrey. I go here when Im in the area I have work close by. They have a fresh selection of seafood, and a healthy selection of fine ingredients along the lines of white truffle olive oil(to me this is Fancy stuff as truffles are hard to grow and Even harder to store plus I hear chefs gush about these.) When I look at the assortment of oils and the limited but fresh selection peppers and cheeses. Im not joking my mouth starts to water. Im no chef but I love food then again who doesnt. Also I have been incarcerated which isnt something I like to say but it does give you a different perspective on food once you realize just how bad the food can be then you go to Fancy rich restaurants where the comparison or the spectrum is so vast and far apart is not even fair to call it a comparison. Its like trying to compare McDonalds to an Italian restaurant that serves fresh homemade pasta. You cant compare the two. Finest at Sea. Has it all in the name. They sell the finest and if you talk to the guys and gals here they will tell you exactly what your getting and when is the best time to buy certain fishes. They also have what they call a bistro Im not actually sure what that means. But you can order things like fish n chips. An amazing shrimp sandwich that just mmmm to die for. One Thing that isnt as good as it used to be and it was literally the reason I started coming here is sadly the clam chowder. They used to have a chef here and I call him a chef not because he cooked but because after he left you realized what a chef is. It isnt someone that can cook, its someone that truly takes pride when you come to tell him I came here just to spend money for your cooking. I came here because I think this is the best and nothing else has even come close to this soup. And when he left, sadly the clam chowder has never been the same. I dont know if he used a different method and never left the full recipe or if he would use a few different ingredients from a recipe that was already there but in my eyes I realized he was truly a chef because he elevated that dish to new heights. I hear a lot of people and also cooking shows say that but when you witness it firsthand you realize what that truly means. And its like taking a burger or a recipe from McDonalds and turning it into the burger nobody knows where it came from but everyone knows they want more of and they want to know who made it so that they could say thank you. And you know the sadest (dont know if thats a word but now I say it is) thing is... I never got his name because at the time I took if for granted I was younger and didnt appreciate life as much. Now that I go back and order the clam chowder it isnt as rich. There was a certain thickness to it that just isnt there anymore. And thats not to say it isnt good. Its just not as great as it used to be. And I hate to say that because maybe they try there best there and one of those cooks there see this and think you know F you I try to make it the best I could. But when you see the ingredients surrounding them and then you see the clam chowder barely has any clams or potatoes it feels more like just a plain watered down mushroom soup how can I say its the best when I have had better. But the shrimp Sandwich is still excellent and I love the fish n chips from here I really do. Im just giving my two cents here. I love the seafood salad and the Avocados Shrimp and Lime salad I think its called. My mom loves the orzo salad when they have it. But the one thing I can never leave without is the Salmon Pate. Mmmm it is the best I have had or found and trust me I am picky as all hell when it comes to calling something the best. In Short Finest at the Sea has the Finest you can find(Except that dam clam chowder IM SORRY It isnt.)",2 years ago,2021-11-22 01:16:05.818624,,,,1,11,5,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116457260974566073148/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

The GOOD: place was busy for a Sat night at 8pm so thats a good sign. Didnt wait long for a table for 2. Pleasantly surprised at the preset 2x combo meats + main + soup + 2 bowls of white rice for $56. So we ordered BBQ duck + pork, main was green beans w minced pork & soup of the day. The MEH: menu should have spelled out that the combo soup is the soup of the day; no choosing. We asked for hot n sour, but the server brought the daily soup instead. When asked why, she then said the combo soup has to be daily soup. I found the BBQ pork and duck very tasty and not too oily. The green beans w minced pork were perfectly crispy but not too deep-fried. Again, very tasty. Didnt care for the daily soup, as its just a thin broth w few veggies + few pieces of meat.

I came to dine-in with my family and got their 5 signature dishes menu which included: - House Special BBQ Platter (Roast Pork, BBQ Duck, Char Siu and Soy Sauce Chicken) - White Pepper Pork Tripe Soup - Lobster with Sticky Rice - Baked Codfish in Yuzu Mustard Sauce - Baked Beef Rib Their BBQ is all done very authentically. Roast pork is super crispy with a good mix of fat and meat. The skin on the BBQ duck is crisp and flavourful as well. If youve had their BBQ meat from the same restaurant in Richmond then you will know what to expect here, very high quality and delicious meats. Being a Chinese seafood restaurant as well, you can expect to order your traditional Chinese cuisine from here. What they also have sprinkled in are some slight fusion dishes that you will not find commonly elsewhere such as the baked codfish with yuzu mustard sauce and the baked beef rib. Their seafood is very fresh (both the lobster and codfish) and the beef rib is so amazingly tender. Definitely would recommend both those dishes. Overall very happy a new BBQ restaurant of this quality opened up in the neighbourhood. Service is very fast and friendly as well. Even though its their first days of opening, they already have line-ups for take-out BBQ.

She was not impressed with the fact that we were the only couple (only staff was there). I told her to just enjoy the fact that all the attention will be towards us.

The salted duck egg with minced pork was almost as good (they should have mixed the egg into the pork) as what my mom made The BBQ hanging on the racks at the front has me wanting to go over and buy and take home in the near future.

The little mini mall has a busy parking lot but you can usually find street parking (both free and paid). Weve been here a few times to grab a quick bbq lunch combo. But we finally visited for dine-in recently. In addition to their bbq service, they have a full Chinese seafood menu offering. We ordered the 3 item bbq combo (you pick and choose which bbq items you want but we opted for the roast pork, bbq, and soya sauce chicken). While the bbq price is higher than the lunch combos, you get more meat. Not a bad price when you consider how much the price of bbq duck has gone up lately. The duck was good... meaty and juicy. Roast pork has nice crispy skin. A welcome addition to the area for bbq. Pea tips were good too. And I like that we received complimentary soup to start and green bean soup for dessert. Really want to come back here and try some of their seafood combos. Update: We did return in October to try a dinner combo with a 2lb lobster sticky rice with 2 bbq items plus 1 other dish for $118 (we picked the sole fillets with veggies). We also added the Taiwanese cauliflower with lap cheung and bacon. Again, you get complimentary soup and dessert.

Good amount of scallops and tasted fresh. Tofu was freshly deep fried before cooking into pot. Very few eggplant.  Tasted a bit too sweet than savory.  Overall a little bit too salty. I will ask for less salt next visit. Service was good and fast. They were very busy. Yet they were able to take care of the basic needs. Polite and friendly.

From the moment I walked in, I was impressed with the friendly and attentive customer service I received from the staff. They were more than happy to answer any questions I had about the products and make recommendations based on my preferences. The seafood at Daily Catch is absolutely top-notch. The freshness and quality of the seafood they sell is outstanding. They had variety of species to choose from and were all expertly handled and packaged. I especially enjoyed the local oysters and the fresh sashimi-grade tuna. The prices were very reasonable, and they had good deals on the specials of the day. I also appreciated the shops commitment to sourcing sustainable seafood. Its always good to know that the seafood Im purchasing is not only delicious but also responsibly sourced.

I know nothing about seafood, and when I called about picking up something on Valentines, the person I spoke to was super helpful, and listed many great options with friendly enthusiasm. They answered all my questions, and encouraged me to come in to see things for myself. So I did, Valentines after work, when I thought they would be slammed/fried/out of everything. Instead, I met Matt, who took time to recommend me his go-to (steelhead), as well as how to cook it -- he added his favourite marinade, gave me the time/temperature/technique, and what touches he likes to add for best flavour. He could not have been nicer or more helpful. It turned out great, was totally delicious, and helped me look good in front of the girl I like...! These guys are great -- Matt for sure.

I had been going there for weeks and each time I asked about whether the fish I was purchasing was oceanwise. I was always told it was. One time though, I purchased some prawns and I just thought these cant be oceanwise based on the type and location of prawn. I was also suspicious because the owner said oh yes, theyre wild when I asked if they were oceanwise, and when I told him that had nothing to do with being oceanwise, he then just said oh yeah, they are oceanwise too. I looked it up and sure enough, not sustainable caught AT ALL. I then realized that this place is not even listed as an oceanwise retailer! Also, the prawns were inedible. They tasted like chlorine and we gagged on them. I will never shop here again and encourage anyone who cares about buying products that are actually sustainable to avoid this place as well.

May I suggest 1) letting your customers know this before hand. 2) getting a scale that has a display that faces the customer.",a year ago,2022-11-22 01:16:41.749269,"Hi J X, Thank you for your feedback.  I want to assure you that our scale is certified and set at -1.1lb as that is the tare weight of the yellow basket. The spot prawns do retain some water once they are taken from the tank and our staff typically adds 0.1 - 0.2lbs worth of spot prawns to the basket to make up for water retention. I can not speak for your exact experience however we do typically shake the basket once it is filled with prawns to remove excess water and this step may have been missed.  I do apologize that you were shorted weight and we would be happy to make it up to you the next time you are in the neighborhood.

Sam was very accommodating with our first purchase here. We will definitely be returning. As a matter of fact well be going back today!!

ChIJuXnQbOV-C0ERvvS_EJjWAhE,Main Aquarium,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNHdjZQSG5BRRAB,dayton chan,4,"When I had walked into the store, the first thing that tranced into my mind first, was the glimpse of the neatness of the product ailses. Everything  in the compartment of wares were decently organized, so you could really scroll through the store with ease. The pricing was reasonable, sometimes the products were cheaper by a couple of bucks and some other products that were very expensive, for instance, seachem paraguard-250 ml being priced at a whoping $30. The fish tanks had a excessively a average price on them, so nothing special about that, although some of the tanks were more on the expensive side. So pricing was pretty standard for an average store like this. There was a lot of selection on meds, fish foods filter medias at a pretty cheap price, so this was one of the few things that stood out from this store. Now, the fish selection. The pricing was fairly reasonable and there exceedingly lots of fish to choose from. Some of the fish were very appealing, their colors gleaming across the glass, for instance, the cardinal tetras and rummy nose tetras. They were a standout for me, because the quality and the looks of the cardinal tetras were some of the most colourful ones I had ever seen in my 15 years of pain, compared to aquariums west, which looked like the terrified faces of the people dying at Travis Scotts Astroworld concert. Most of the fish were healthy, however I had spotted a couple of dead or dying fish in the tanks, and several of the tanks were very cloudy and filthy, for instance, the goldfish tank, so that is one thing to improve on in this store, is to have a daily check on the fish, and quarantine sick fish and dispose dead fish. One thing I was dissapointed in, was the bettas in cups. They were unfiltered, and was very cramped, so next time try to make a filtered betta set up and try to upgrade the cups to small acrylic tanks. Finally, the customer service needs a bit of improvement, because the owner looks like he experienced vietnam flashbacks. When I did some communication with him, he didnt show much enthusiasm and  replied to me in a monotonous manner. Also when I was try to pick a schooling fish for my 32.5 gallon aquarium, he did what the call the asian death stare(my dad does this a lot) so it was a bit uncomfortable, felt like I was the victim of the John F Kennedy assasination, but eventually I got a bit used to it. Henceforth, this is a pretty good, average fish store with a couple of quirks, and I reccomend this store to anyone who doesnt care too much about customer service, but wants some high quality schooling or centerpiece fish including a good selection of fish supplies.",2 years ago,2021-11-22 01:16:59.498974,Thank you very much !,2 years ago,2021-11-22 01:16:59.498974,5,8,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103861268243453758100/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

I ve been coming here for a few years now for my seafood, and could never go anywhere else - it is always super fresh, and super delicious. Their organic spring salmon is some of the best I ve ever had (highly recommend), and their smoked salmon selection is fantastic. I always go for the peppered nuggets (super moist and flavourful), the double smoked, and the cold smoked spring - they re the only people I ve seen who cold smoke spring salmon!

Today I bought a piece of cod ($25/lb) with a sign that said fresh and local only to get it home and find a big parasitic worm next to it. From what I can tell online, this only happens when the fresh fish is not filleted right away but is kept whole, giving the worm a chance to borrow through from the fishs intestine out of the fish. Sure, its probably fine when cooked thoroughly. I did cook it but could not enjoy it and threw half of it away.

ChIJQbheg3xxhlQR6OwppFbiq-c,Catch,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtdDlLWjV3RRAB,Spike Luk,4,I attended my first game of the season Dec 10th.  The Canucks played and lost to the Minnesota Wild.  The lobster roll was honestly my favorite thing about attending Canucks  games.  The lobster roll tasted good.  The lobster meat was cooked well and the texture perfect.  I admit it s been a few years since I had season tickets.  I renewed this year and told everyone the lobster roll was a can t miss.  The lobster roll held it s own but the new kettle chips are a miss.   Bring back Ms Vickies!  The kettle chips were hard and tasteless.,11 months ago,2022-12-22 01:17:31.906387,,,,0,152,1242,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106634619342049869051/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,
