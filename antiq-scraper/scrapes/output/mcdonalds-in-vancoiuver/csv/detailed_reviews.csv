I definately recommend all to try out this location, you will never again return to all those problem locations again.

My wife has worked at a company thats on Annacis Island where this Mcds is, for close to 30 years. We have gotten to know quite a few of the staff. Sure there is turnover of staff but 30 years steady gives one lots of time to get to know alot of new people. Annacis Island has alot of warehousing rather than retail business so clientel is 99% warehouse workers,truck drivers and office staff. So its different in a nice way...lts not that I dont like children or old people..we all will be that ,if we live long enough ,but your not going to see much of them here.

Tasty beef patties on a sesame bun  are bad for you! Literally everything within the walls of McDonalds is not healthy. But that s not why I eat here!! I give this place 5 star cuz sometimes  Life is rough. Life is busy. Life only has time for a McMergancy!! Not sure why this place gets such low Google score. This McDonald s location has been a pillar of the community for 50+ years. I come here randomly and honestly consider every experience on par or better than most other locations.

If theyre goal is to give the full dine in experience, they should not offer their wrapped plastic fork/knife. They should have stainless steel cutleries for their customers. The sandwiches are huge, as you are creating your own food, so when theyre serving the sandwiches, they should include the cutleries right away. Other than that, the food was amazing, and the hospitality was excellent.

It is Nov 13th 2016 in the afternoon. Its not terribly busy, theres 2 floors with the upstairs hosting one of the rare play places, and the service is on point. I walked in, saw the digital ordering kiosks. I love how amazingly powerful they are. Dont forget that you can tap on an order and hit Customize to go crazy with the most granular possible nit picky stuff you can think of.  Today the Build Your Taste burger builder was fully integrated and let me absolutely get the details I wanted. Once the order was complete it got me to pick up an elecronic device known as a Table Tracker, this allowed me to bring my kid upstairs to the play place with my number and pretty close after ordering two gentlemen came upstairs with my order on a wooden paddle, and my daughters happy meal carried separately and carefully. The men asked us if we wanted any condiments, to which we asked for ketchup to which they happily obliged. No restaurant, especially fast food, has evolved over time quite like McDonalds. I though McCafe was a pretty big deal when it came around but now McDonalds seems to be catering to thise who want real food, with real service one could experience at a standard family restaurant.  Except i dont have to wait 35 minutes to an hour gor my order to come about. I imagine it wont be like this all the time, in fact im pretty sure to expect just like what happened to FatBurger. Sure everyones enthusiastic now, give it a month and some change and well be back to old habbits.

This location really needs its own full-time security personnel. She should not have had to handle that on her own, or wait for mall security to arrive.
