You can customize your burger, and they never mess it up, plus the great fries. They are just a fav go-to place for a quick burger and fries. The fact that they give you free peanuts in shell and have their potato bags all around the store with the peanut oil which they fry it in just creates an awesome environment. Love the open kitchen and the fact that you can see the fries are cut right there, with skin in different shapes. Just so much better than many fast food chains. I just wish they were open longer hours and had more locations.",

I always come here when I want a hamburger, and I get impressed In my last visit, the gentleman who attended to us took the order and immediately he follow us to clean our table, the environment was also clean and chill, then I decided to take some peanuts before we took our meal, those peanuts are a hungry relief right before you eat your cheeseburger, they even not take a long time, food was fresh and good as every time I come.

Fries were a bit salty, but it perfectly balanced the fatty taste from the burger. I always order my burger with some bacon in it, never regretted. They use peanut oil, so be careful with your allergies. They do bottomless refills on pop and unlimited supply of toasted peanuts. Peanuts, you would think. But it was ridiculous how many peanuts I had. At first, it doesnt feel anything special, then 10 minutes later, you are left with piles of peanut shells. I know its American chain, but you gotta enjoy this.",

This visit I was only getting a cheeseburger to go because it was close to dinner time.  I took my cheeseburger to go and upon arriving home about 20 minutes or so later the burger was still toasty.  :)  You can add your own customized toppings but I just the basic and love their burgers.  Just the way I like them.  I also realized I got the regular burger instead of the mini so it has 2 patties.  I had to skip dinner. :)   I appreciate this business as they are always so busy when I go and they are just hopping and hustling and everyone gets fed.  Thank you!",

Now I m a big fan of Five Guys fries :p Their topping selection is also great point- grilled mushrooms and onions are always the best. What makes me sad is they don t serve milkshakes-one of their featured one. When I was in US, I loved combos with all(burger, fries and milkshake). It takes some time to prepare the food, but it s worthy. Highly recommended!",

The burgers were moist and built with the exact toppings you want. The fries were well seasoned, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside (I highly recommend the cajun style fries). This place is essentially a step above fast food, fast food + if you will. Not quite as good as a steakhouse burger or a proper restaurant burger but would pick this over any of the typical fast food places any day.

The floors had food and garbage, and the bathrooms were filthy.  The bathrooms were a major one for me because the mess appeared to have been there all day. Wheelchair accessibility: You can get into the restaurant, order, and sit in a few of the tables that are closest to the door.  You cant easily get a wheelchair to the back to pick up your food, get condiments and drinks, or access the bathrooms due to the tables being in the way and the amount of skip the dishes drivers and other customers standing around waiting for their orders.  It is pure chaos in that area, but another customer offered help.",

Unlimited peanuts in a barrel for the taking as well. The Cajun fries are very good and you can ask for sides of mayo for no charge.

                "review_text": "Bin 4 Burger Lounge (2996 Granville St., Vancouver) I recently had the pleasure of dining at Bin 4 Burger Lounge located on Granville Street in Vancouver, and I must say that it was a delightful experience. This trendy and cozy restaurant specializes in crafting gourmet burgers with a unique twist, and it certainly lived up to its reputation. First and foremost, the ambiance of Bin 4 Burger Lounge was inviting and contemporary. The interior was tastefully decorated with a combination of rustic and modern elements, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The seating arrangements were comfortable, and the staff was attentive and friendly, providing prompt service throughout my visit. Now lets talk about the star of the show the burgers. Bin 4 Burger Lounge offers an extensive selection of burgers, each with its own distinct flavor profile. From classic beef burgers to inventive vegetarian options, there is something to satisfy every palate. I opted for their signature Bin 4 Burger, and it did not disappoint. The patty was juicy, perfectly cooked, and seasoned to perfection. The toppings were fresh, and the brioche bun was soft and complemented the burger beautifully. The portion sizes were generous, ensuring that I left feeling completely satisfied. In addition to their impressive burger menu, Bin 4 Burger Lounge also offers a variety of tasty sides and appetizers. Their truffle Parmesan fries were a standout, with a delightful combination of flavors that elevated the dining experience. The restaurant also boasts a selection of craft beers and cocktails to complement the meal, adding another layer of enjoyment. While the overall dining experience at Bin 4 Burger Lounge was excellent, there were a few minor areas where improvements could be made. Firstly, the wait times during peak hours can be a bit long, so its advisable to make a reservation or plan your visit accordingly. Secondly, the pricing is slightly on the higher side, especially when considering the add-ons and sides. However, the quality of the ingredients and the exceptional flavors justify the price to a large extent. In conclusion, Bin 4 Burger Lounge is a must-visit spot for burger enthusiasts in Vancouver. With its inviting atmosphere, flavorful burgers, and attentive service, it delivers a memorable dining experience. While it may be a bit pricey, the quality and taste of the food make it worth the investment. I will definitely be returning to Bin 4 Burger Lounge for another mouthwatering burger adventure in the future. Our server was Jessi, and he is very friendly and his service was superb. Parking: It s on the back side of the restaurant",

The burger I ordered was amazing. I love how it looked exactly how it did in the picture. It was also a huge burger that I was able to eat only half of it and had to take the rest home. I ordered the Lob It To Me Burger which had lobster, goat cheese and truffle aioli. It was delicious. Im definitely bringing my family here next time.",

However, the fries were not crispy and were a bit too soft and soggy for my taste. They offer a variety of burgers made from chicken, vegan, beef, fish, and bison, with numerous flavors to choose from, and the overall quality of the food was excellent. The seating was comfortable, making it a great place to hang out. They offer a fantastic late-night special after 9 pm, where you can order any burger with fries or salad for only $11, along with a non-alcoholic drink. Excellent servive by the servers.",

Surprisingly, my favourite thing I had there was the strawberry goat cheese salad, it was probably the best tasting thing in my opinion that came as an upgrade side to the burger.",

The Bin 4 Burger is made with a juicy, perfectly cooked beef patty that was seasoned to perfection. The burger was topped with crispy bacon, melted cheddar cheese, fresh avocado, and a tangy aioli sauce. The combination of flavors and textures was outstanding - every bite was bursting with deliciousness. Overall, I would highly recommend Bin 4 Burger Lounge for anyone looking for a delicious and satisfying meal. The quality of the food and the attention to detail in the flavors and presentation were truly impressive.",

They have a wide range on the menu and therell be something that will for sure catch your eye. The kitchen is very efficient and very quick at getting your food out. However, this place does get busy in the evenings and weekends so budget your time. They have a very well priced menu. Old: The burgers are really good. The fries are okey nothing special. The onion rings are not so good, they do use red onions for the onion rings but it does not improve the flavor. Service was good again nothing special.

The truffle burger is a must try for truffle lover. The burger is really juicy and tasty. I would suggest adding dill to fried pickles so there would be a difference between the batter used for Onion ring and the batter for the pickles. That was just an opinion. All in all this restaurant is a gem and the experience and service are fabulous. Did I mention the happy hour?",

                "review_text": "Bin 4 has some great burgers. The burgers here arent so typical, they play around and try to create interesting flavors. I didnt get to try just a normal burger here, so I have no idea how they stack up for a purist, but the burgers we tried were really great. I tried the Minted Lamb burger and it was so delicious. The blue cheese stood out, but the eggplant and tomato relish brought some great sweetness that combined so well with the lamb. I would eat this burger again in a heart beat. My dining mates had the Big Dipper (a play on a beef dip, but with a burger) and the Bistro (a chicken, brie and bacon burger). Both were well received! Bin 4 lets you have your choice of aioli for dipping (normally for fries, but theyll still give it to you with a salad!) and it was so fun to try them out. Also, the happy hour is incredible. All their single cocktails are 5$, so we each tried one and Id love to come again and try more. Sorry for the unimpressive photos! It was very bright out and hard to get them to be not overexposed.",

                "review_text": "Spontaneous choice results in one of the best burgers I have ever eaten! Normally when we eat out, we review the place we go in order to get the value out of quantity, quality, service and atmosphere. Bin 4 Burger Lounge did not disappoint, despite being a spontaneous choice with little if any review. We were greeted by a friendly staff and sat down on their patio, where a brief review of the specials and happy hour drinks, which was followed by what was included in the regular menu choices and what was extras or up-scaling. After receiving our drinks and complementary home made chips (or crisps) we ordered a Black and Blue burger with their fires and a Wild Mushroom with up-scaled onion rings, both of which came with our choice of aioli dipping sauce. The Black & Blue with the jalapeno aioli sauce was juicy and topped with fresh tomato and arugula as well as a small mound of sweet red onion relish. All the flavours were distinct and complementary, with each of the described ingredients tasting fresh. The fries, as good as they were, may have been a bit too much for the appetite behind the order, and thus the salads we saw were envied for the refreshment that was desired. You know how it is, who doesnt want fries with it; until youre too full for the last three bites. As for the Wild Mushroom, it too was a delight. I might also add that the bun was PERFECT on both burgers; light and airy with good texture and chew needed to keep everything together until the last bite. The beef patties were also meaty and juicy (dripping down the hand juicy - worthy of an extra napkin) with a nice char reminding us of a great summer bbq.  The toppings were generous and again fresh, especially since I am quite critical to mushroom burgers at other locations where they charge an extra 1.00 for 5 mushroom slices that taste like nothing. THIS burger came with its own mushroom mountain that tasted like they were picked, sliced and sauteed 5 minutes ago. I dont need to say much about their onion rings because if you look at others photos, you will notice consistency of complete and utter yumminess. The pictures do not lie, they redefine what an onion ring should be. And the aioli sauces . . . I am desiring to taste them all. The jalapeno dip was different enough from the bacon aioli that I could not decide which of the two I liked the best. If I had any complaint, it would have to be with the tomato garnish. This is not a complaint against Bin 4, since we are all subject to what the tomato farmers give us out of their greenhouses. Where have all the tomatoes from my childhood gone? They tasted like tomatoes! All in all, this was a delight and a gem to remember! I am glad we can still be spontaneous and still feel rewarded for the choices we make.",

                "review_text": "They have recently upped the price of late night starting at 9PM from around $10 per burger to 50% whatever burger you choose. Its fair, considering there is a huge price gap between some of the vegetarian burgers and the much-coveted bison burger. FOOD: Always delicious. I would recommend staying away from the half-and-half option for combos as the portions for each come out to be smaller than if you just got a full order of either fries or salad. I went with my friend who rarely eats salads because of venomous hatred but he actually complimented the salad, which says something. DRINK: Lots of creative drink options but no free refills. During late night, you get 50% off a burger only if you purchase a drink so Ive ordered one religiously since coming. Some, like their Raspberry Lemon Fizz, are a miss. INTERIOR: So cozy that you will be tempted to nap inside. The music and kitchen noises arent too loud, plus with the ambient lighting and plush seats and sofas you may feel your eyelids droop every time. SERVICE: Always professional and prompt :)",

They listened attentively to our feedback and was constantly making sure that all customers were satisfied with their experience. We thought the food to be a bit expensive when we first glanced at the menu, but we left thinking it was worth every penny. Will definitely go back!",

Filled with so much flavor and has a nice spice to it. The consomme and the garlic sauce on the side was also delicious. Sad that it s only around for a limited time but it s definitely a must try! My only complain was the service, the waitresses took a while to come take our orders as well as give our bills. However the food did come quite fast which was nice. Another down side is the fact that there s no toilet in the restaurant. Other than that, great food!!",

The restaurants biggest plus point for me is the fact that they offer halal options, which can be hard to come by. The beef and chicken dishes were both flavorful and cooked to perfection, with just the right amount of crispiness and warmth. The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating, making our dining experience all the more enjoyable. The restaurant was very well managed in terms of seating and orders, which is always a plus. Located near English Bay, Vonns is definitely worth a visit if youre in town. Overall, I would highly recommend Vonns to anyone looking for a delicious and authentic halal dining experience. The food is top-notch, the staff are friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. 5 stars!",

Great flavour, perfect amount of sauce and cheese, soft bun. The truffle scoop fries were crispy with some thicker, more wedge sized pieces, seasoned well but they didnt come with a sauce so they were on the drier side. Twice as much as I would spend on 2 items like this but it really is a great sandwich!",

They have a patio area with umbrellas, as well as a shaded indoor seating area, but the whole restaurant is open to the bay so you get plenty of sun and noise from the beach. Food was fantastic, I dont know if Id go with the truffle cheesesteak again (its savory enough without the truffle  ), but the staff were friendly and accommodating, if a little busy. Wheelchair accessibility: They have a patio that opens right onto the sidewalk, with a pretty wide opening in the fence, and there are no elevation changes inside the seating area. Not sure if the washroom is accessible.",

The burger was great too, one of the best simple burgers I ve had. Prices are so reasonable. Only thing I think I would change is the menu, it s a little small.

The sauce complements the sub and the sauerkraut really balances out the sandwich. I would come back here and try others. A bit steep on the wallet, however the location and especially view from the veranda is nice. Great halal spot. Would recommend others to come try as one of the go-to spots in yvr. The water for $2.35 on the menu is definitely a turn off, bring your own bottle :)",

When we got here, there was a bit of a wait but we didn t mind because we had heard positive things. Everything on the menu sounded really good so it was hard to pick just a few things. We ended up ordering The Rocket to share, which was my favourite item and something I highly recommend. We also ordered The XD burger and a Chic Halloumi Sando. Both of those were also really good and left us very full. The service is also great, with some really friendly staff members. Also, everything on the menu is halal so to anyone visiting Vancouver looking for halal restaurants, this is the spot! Easy 5 stars.",

Find myself a halal-certified gourmet burger restaurant in Vancouver after only having Mediterranean/Persian foods whenever I eat out Officially had my first burger in Canada at Vonns Denman and it definitely set a high bar already! I tried their special menu of the week which is the XD burger. Premium beef patty coated with seasoned melted cheese. I was a bit surprised because it was a bit spicy but as a spicy food lover, my tongue like the flavor burst of it! The portion was more than decent, I guess it will keep you full until the next day . You should try to dip your burger and fries to the mayo-like sauce next to the ketchup, it adds some bold flavor-enhancing kicks to both of them!! Definitely will come back to try out their steak    and chicken burgers",

Simple, juicy and greasy! Their menu keeps it simple as well. It can be found and vonns.com. The Chicken Burgers are MASSIVE. Easily two chicken breasts worth of meat. Ive had a taste of the steak sandwich too and it is pretty good. The portions are massive here and will definitely fill you up. I typically go for a classic if Im not too hungry, a double if Im pretty hungry and a Daredevil (triple patty) if Im feeling dangerous. The Truffle Fries are a MUST try. Soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and paired with their dip is chefs kiss. Regular fries just dont cut it anymore for me. The service is excellent with the staff always friendly and patient waiting to answer any questions you have. The place has great decor that appears to change seasonally as well as a very clean interior with plastic dividers. They have a covered outside area and some indoor seating and the location is less than a 2 minute walk from the beach. Definitely a must try when you are here!",

My family and I are visiting from Toronto and we were recommended to try Vonn s and the food did not disappoint! We ordered the Steak Frites and the steak was cooked so well - it was juicy and perfect. The rocket fries appetizer was fulfilling but also really good, definitely something to order if you have a large party and need an appetizer to share. The XD burger was so fresh! Even the chicken tenders were so good! The food is phenomenal! Definitely a spot to check out if you re in the Vancouver area! Its right in front of a beach waterfront too so the views are nice and the area is great to walk around.",

Once there since we were a larger party we had to wait for a table however, we were educated on the menu and what they are known for. My husband and I shared the chicken sandwich and a classic cheesesteak! WOW! Not only were the portions huge but they were AMAZING!! My 1 year old and 3 year old shared the chicken strips and ate almost all of it! That s how much they loved it! Everything is freshly cooked and so tasty! The owner checked on us and made sure everything was to our liking! I definitely recommend stopping here!! It is also perfect walking distance to the beach!",

And you get a lot of it (1.5 steaks?) stuffed into one sandwich. Need to start a new paragraph to talk about the truffle fries, which were amazing. Cut like thick chips. Thickly crispy on the outside, soft in the middle. Dressed in a truffle parmesan sauce. This was close to the best fries/chips Ive ever had, and Im a connoisseur. Even the salad is worth mentioning as it had a tasty dressing with crispy (fried garlic?) topping. Only complaint is the price. $19 for the steak sando.",

They used to not smash their burger and it was insane but they were forced to smash all of them or something, still, 5 star burgers. The chicken fingers, you have to get them hot and fresh right away, are literally the best in the world. No seriously, they are simply incredible. Delicately juicy but with the perfect thin crunch, unbelievable. For fries go with the truffle fries, bomb, they also make for great munchie chips for later. (They keep in the fridge overnight, which is not possible to say about regular french fries). I still need to try the cheesesteaks etc., but i wont be able to resist the chicken fingers again next time i order out, i cook a lot at home and know my spots, this is one of a very select few that are at the top of the list. Order up the whole menu, and enjoy.",

We went close to the closing time, and the restaurant was packed but he made sure we had our food before they close for the night. Vonns serve undoubtedly the most flavorful items. We tried the double patty beef burger and the Vonns special cheesesteak. The patties of the burger were juicy enough, and cooked to the perfection. The bun was soft but not soggy. The fries complimented the burger and made the meal wholesome. The cheesesteak was equally delicious. Will we visit this restaurant again? Of course, whenever we have the cravings for burger, this will be our place to go.",

One of the greatest hospitalities I have ever seen! I think it was the owner himself going around, welcoming and talking about the specials to every guests on every table. When he heard that it was our first time dining in at Vonns, he suggested that we dont take combos with each meal but get one dish to share and when we chose truffle fries, he said they will ne on the house! He made sure to take our feedback after we finished eating (we couldnt exactly finish those large portions, so we had to pack up the leftovers!). My steak was medium instead of the rare medium that it was supposed to be (it still tasted great!). The man apologized profusely for this tiny mistake and did not charge me for my entire meal and made me promise that I visit a second time for the perfect buttery medium rare steak. I never messaged because it felt like ripping off a small business. But when I posted a review on Facebook, they messaged me themselves with the voucher for free meals for 2. They really make you feel special! Thank you Vonns for making our first visit (potentially of many) an excellent experience! They deserve more than 5/5! P.S. their new XD burger is totally worth the hype!",

The food was as usual delicious and the final twist of the evening was the owner refused to take the payment and even declined to allow me to pay the tips . My wife was pleasantly embarrassed with the owner s goodwill gesture . We profusely thanked him for the hospitality . We prayed from the core of our heart for continued blessings and success  of the owner . Highly recommended the cuisine , professional attitude .",

They normally make the steak medium, then u can have it with fries or the potato slices thing, forgot what its called, and it comes with sauces its so good. The steak was so soft and tender. Its halaal too, for those who need to know...It was delicious, it comes with ketchup and chipotle sauce and garlic sauce. Parking is on the street, so stones becomes difficult to find. Staff are very friendly. The meat runs out, so call in before you come to check if they are open and still have their meat. I would recommend it anytime and would go again anytime!",

Plus, what was something that was really interesting to me was that you could pay after your meal. ****A very special feature for me was that all the food served at this restaurant was halal.**** The staff recommended the double cheeseburger combo (fries and soda can extra 4$) and it s absolutely delicious.

We all ate too much after enjoying our food, which is always the best indication of good comfort food. I enjoyed a massive burger with double most things and added deep fried jalapenos, also had a side of fries, more jalapenos, and poutine and a shake. All hit the spot - burger was juicy and cooked fresh, fries crisp, and I ended up only eating a quarter of my poutine because my kids fought over the rest and didn t share. Both kids say they would return, and their only complaint was the food was so good the ate until they felt ill. Serves them right. A bit more expensive than your regular fast food place, or their that other burger place down the street, but it s worth it. Money well spent, and time enjoyed.",

You can also have shots of tequila and beer and get absolutely hammered right beside other bars at a way cheaper price. Always recommended to visit Veras burger",

Our favourites are the the onion rings, poutine & Buffalo Chicken burger. So good!! We have also ordered it via Uber Eats and it came super fast. The onion rings r fresh and crispy. The fries and poutine are delish. Lots of gravy and cheese. The Buffalo chicken has a sauce on it that is awesome. Not too spicy but just enough kick to give it an amazing flavour. The best thing about this spot, when going in person, is the service. The ladies who work here are very family oriented in the sense that they are personable and remember you when you return. Its really nice to have that special personable service in a city that can sometimes leave you feeling invisible :-) We will keep coming back here...hopefully for a long long time <3",

One time they missed my gravy and I went back up there and she gave me another gravy on top of the one that I purchased and a gift certificate. She has amazing customer service I see her working all the time shes a very hard worker and anyone that could ever write a bad review I would never take seriously.

Its hard to expect that kind of service from a place right in the middle of downtown, considering theres no shortage of business coming in. We were here in the evening on a Friday where I assume its quite busy, and the service was still fantastic! Ill definitely recommend this place to anyone and Ill for sure be coming back!",

                "review_text": "After a day of running all around Vancouver before a meeting, I was really craving a burger.  A really good burger.  A spectacular and indulgent burger. Yelp saves me in these situations, so I did a search and headed over to Veras.  Parking was really easy to find on the street.  (Side note: I love parking in Vancouver because it is so easy to do with credit cards.  The flashing green traffic lights I still dont understand...)  I got a little nervous about the outside because the awning is ostentatious and still doesnt really stand out compared to what is next to it, but then I went inside. With hockey playing on four screens, this feels like a very Canadian way of eating a burger, but somehow it doesnt feel too sports-bar-like.  Clean and open, it is easy to read the menus and order.  The cashier was very friendly and told me she would bring the food to me. I ordered sweet potato fries and they were perfect; both crispy and hot. This is a rarity for sweet potato fries, which I can never figure out.  If they have good breading, they arent hot; if they are hot, they dont taste good.  Somehow, Veras pulled it off. The burger was also great. I ordered the works and pulled a few things off because it was so big.  A very sweet, gruff-voiced attendant (possibly the owner) checked on me to see if they needed to fix the order, although it was perfect.  He checked on me at the end, too.  The entire time I was eating, he was constantly cleaning and taking care of tables.  Really incredible service and attention. I am over-the-top impressed.",

We then decided to come here where they served us delicious burgers in half the time and money of any other burger place!

The atmosphere is super aesthetic ~ I do wish that there was more seating in the Hundy area (instead of a giant yellow pole) without having to go into the speakeasy The Stockroom. But this isnt that big of an issue as the burgers stay fresh when you take them to go as well! Very yum!!",

Yesterday night, I had enough, it was time to try out Hundy. First impressions, the music playlist really sets the vibe of the whole place. I love how they converted this place into a restaurant at night and a coffee shop by day. I also like that the take my phone number and text me when my table is ready approach. It s a counter service restaurant (like PDX restaurants) so while we waited for our table we ordered beers. Their beers are constantly changing but I had the Farmhouse 33 Acres experiment beer and it was amazing. It s a very refreshing IPA without too many hops and fruity flavours. Alright, 4th paragraph in, I should start talking about the food. I ordered the bacon cheese burger with fries. The sauce in the burger is what makes this burger amazing. It s hard to explain what it is, but their secret sauce is boss. Bun, patty, veg, and cheese were all great sidekicks in this burger. But, the true Robin to the Batman were the fries. These fries  their like my crown jewel of fries  places like Cockney Kings and other OG fish and chips places. You think you come here for the burger, but when you leave  the fries are what you think about. My buddy Bryan ordered the bacon poutine with a chicken burger. I tried the poutine and must say it was worth the $7. As for his review of the chicken burger, he said,  I ll be back. . Once I posted the pics on IG, the DMs exploded with,  How was it?   Is the hype real?",

We didnt try the fries  because they happened to be having a poutine special that night, so we ordered two of those instead of fries. Absolutely delicious. We didnt need to wait long since we got there a bit early, but be prepared to because the line didnt shorten at all the entire time we were there. But the burgers will absolutely be worth the wait!

The restaurant is small but prominent. Inside the seating is bar style along the window with stools and a couple of tables and chairs outside, a very clean establishment inside and out. I ordered from Dave who was great. He explained what they offered and also made suggestions and pondered mixing and match sauces with us. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with the Hundy sauce and a poutine. We didn t have to wait long and they provide you with a buzzer so you know when your order is ready. I was amazed with the food and absolutely loved it. I have not had a great sandwich like this in a long time. Prices are not bad and the experience is straightforward order, eat, enjoy. Then come back again. I know I ll be back. Nice job Hundy. See you soon!",

I ve got the truffle mushroom burger recommend by the staff with a half poutine, the burger is rich and flavourful, everything works really well together.

My partner and I were standing outside the omelettery, puzzled by the burger sign, as we tried to open up the qr code menu on our phones. The owner, Sina, flung open the front door and welcomed us to look at the menu inside. He then took us on a journey on how his burger ingredients were sourced, prepared and served. All of which, was brimming with excitement and passion. You could really tell Sina was really proud of what he and his team were slinging. His pitch made us forget we were walking over from having dessert. We had to try one, even though we were full. We got the juicy original burger, and we enjoyed it next to our car, under the lights of a carpet store. So I cant say for sure how well it holds up for delivery or long transport. The beef: smash-seared perfectly. Not too thin that you get jerky. Smashed enough so you get a crisp meaty crust but the center is still juicy. The bun: airy, light, not soggy or falling aparty. The caramelized onions: slowly cooked to a perfect unrushed jammy perfection. Will definitely be back to try the other more hefty burgers!",

I got the lettuce wrapped cheeseburger with carmelized onions (carmelized for 12-24 hours) with bacon and it was perfection. They re open from 5pm-1am and it s pick-up or delivery only.

It was genuinely the best I ve ever had and I ve had my fair share of burgers across the country. We re traveling from out of province and looking for something to eat. I have to say one of the best foods I ve had throughout our entire trip to Vancouver. The buns were so soft and the patty tasted extremely delicious and slightly crispy which was perfect. The flavours were incredible. I got the Pineapple Express burger and my friend got the regular cheese burger and both were crazy good. I was tempted to buy another. Enough that we went back and tried their poutine. I really liked it. I love how they added onions to top it off. The gravy flavour is great. I would definitely get their burgers again if we ever come back to Vancouver. Also thanks for the free cookies    Hopefully one day they come have a restaurant in our city",

If youre ordering in person, it feels a bit like youre at a burger speakeasy. I had the pineapple express. A generous amount of delicious beef meat with a bit of rib eye in there, whiskey BBQ sauce, pineapple, tomato, crispy onion bits... Finger-licking good. The picture doesnt do justice to it. Know that the burgers do not come with fries, but I was clearly there for the burgs and honestly it felt like a satisfying meal in itself. Staff was awesome, passionned about their burgers, talking about them. The hype was real and I wasnt disappointed. Got a glass of water and sat until my burger was ready, got a free cookie as it was my 1st time. Seriously go try their burgers.",

Starting with the packaging, box container to prevent smushing and foil to retain heat. Bun was buttery and fragrant but not overly sweet. The cheese was still melted and needed no reheating. My usual gripe with smash patties is that I seem to get less meat than I would a usual burger, not so with Joes.  The patties were stacked high and each one was super crispy.

Something you dont get with using a meal delivery service is the great customer service from the staff and owner. Do not hesitate, try Juicy Joes Burgers! Take-out/pick-up only.

Everyone working there is super friendly too - I called in a takeout order last night and it was going to be ready before I could get there, so they delayed it for me so it would be fresher without any problem. It is takeout only (operating from the omelleterie, which closes before they open), so I recommend people plan on eating in the park nearby or driving it right home. The food keeps in the takeout bag reasonably well (fries still crispy, burger hot and juicy with no runoff) but like any food the faster you can eat it after cooking the better it tastes! Ive been mentioning to people that I have a new secret burger place and then showing them it on the map. Its a good conversation starter, though the 500 reviews here seem to point to my secret getting out...",

While searching, we found this place on google and had really great reviews so we decided to give it a try! We couldn t find it at first but after driving around where it was supposed to be, we found it. They only do take out as they don t have their own place yet. The customer service was amazing, the owner was there and he chatted with us while we were waiting for our food and gave us great recommendations. All the food on the menu was carefully thought out and some of the ingredients were highly sourced out as well. The workers there had really great knowledge of the menu as well and recommended us on what their favourite things were on the menu and I m so glad we listened to them. We ordered the yam fries and they were really good, the house mayo was the best as it was super creamy! For our mains we ordered the truffle mushroom burger and the mushroom blue and I only have great things to say, the mushroom blue is by far the BEST burger I ve ever had and the truffle burger comes second! We also ordered cookies and they gave it to us on the house and that was a really nice touch! If you ever come to Vancouver, you guys need to try this place out, you won t regret it! We will definitely come back when we re in van city and hopefully they have their own restaurant by then! :)",

We felt like we were being smothered with love, almost like we ve known them for ages. All the staff from reception, to the chef, to the manager/owner, the hospitality and service was incredible.

But thats not where it ends, because the fries step up and demonstrate that they are not here to play 2nd fiddle to those burgers. Crispy on the outside but still a nice interior consistency. With a light seasoning they have a lovely flavour on their own, but when combined with the roasted garlic dip? Amazing. Its a little bit hard to find, until you realize it is actually run out of the same location as the Omelettery. This is a great small business. They are open late, have super friendly staff, and great food! Whats not to love? (No photos, I didnt want to waste a second by grabbing my phone instead of the food.)",

Let me start off by saying the food is 10/10 and I have NEVER had a smash burger as tasty as Juicy Joes! I have lived in California and have been all over USA and tried several different burgers but these guys nailed the recipe. The burger and it s ingredients are completely fresh and it literally melts in your mouth when you take a bite. The onions are caramelized to perfection, the meat is exceptional quality, with a crunchy and golden brown texture, and the American cheese + bun is to die for. Literally the best Ive had in my entire life. The owner Cena is a charismatic and very passionate man whose hospitality is very welcoming. He is a very kind man who is always smiling and going above and beyond with his service. All the chefs and employees and extremely hard working with the best energy ALWAYS. Do not miss this hidden gem, it deserves all the flowers, reviews, and appreciation. I eat here a few times every week and cannot get enough! JUICY JOES FOR THE WIN",

This was the best service experience I ve ever had at a restaurant by far. The guy at the front was kind, funny, and had a great energy. I ordered a full poutine and a jr cheeseburger for about $28CAD, but also got a free cookie, side of fries, and orange juice. The cheeseburger is easily the most flavorful burger I ve had, especially given its simplicity. their poutine is also great. the fries were crispy and fluffy, the cheese was melty, and the gravy was warm and delicious. I can t recommend this place enough, it s worlds better than your favorite chain burger restaurant!",

It wasn t like I was having a bad day when I happened to happen upon the hallowed halls of Joe s storied kitchen, I was just feeling generally kind of listless in life. Which is arguably worse. However, as I m sure you ve already guessed, my dear, hungry, hamburger loving reader, all of my malaise and ennui melted away as soon as Juicy Joe s delightfully classic cheeseburger entered my universe. The carefully selected, locally sourced ingredients, the meticulous manner in which each culinary element worked in concert to create a definitively delectable and singularly scrumptious consumption experience, and ultimately the marvellous man behind the magical sandwich all helped to remind me that there are so many things to live for. To live is to aspire to lofty goals and then pursue them with as much tenacity as kindness. With as much fierce perseverance as brotherly understanding. With all your mind and all your heart. Juicy Joe s serves up more than just tasty burgers. Juicy Joe s will reinvigorate your passion to dream, to attain, and to live. Thanks for the burger Juicy Joe s! You changed my life, and I will be forever grateful.",

I also couldnt get enough of their crispy and savory poutine, complete with vegan gravy options that were just as delicious. The service was top-notch, and the atmosphere was casual and inviting, making it the perfect spot for a quick lunch or casual dinner. Its no surprise that Juicy Joes has a 4.9-star rating on Google - they truly deserve it. If youre a burger fan, dont miss out on Juicy Joes.

I really enjoyed the crush fries and tofu nuggets too! Will go back for sure. It d be lovely if they bring some sour beers too!! Vegetarian options: Yummiest veg burger everrr",

Very clean inside, ambiance is very comforting and the staff was friendly. The person at the till was super helpful with recommendations and I went with all his recommendations. What I ordered: Veggie style Cheese Burger, Single patty (Recommend) $11.50 Combo: Fries and a Orange Milkshake (Recommend) $11 This veggie burger hit all the spots for flavour, their in house sauce laying under fresh tasty veggies and the veggie patty was satisfying, slightly crispy but not greasy in a brioche bun. Highly recommend, the burger was super filling so warning the fries were very tasty as well but it was quite a lot! They fresh cut their fries thin like McDonald s but tastes so much better, crispy, thin and not as greasy. To top off my order I wanted to try their milkshakes. Staff had reco the orange milkshake and what a pleasant surprised that turned out to be! Reminds me of a cream soda orange pop but in a creamy milkshake version! Overall everything was super tasty, I d recommend taking your order to go if you re making it a combo but the burger itself was good enough. I d come back to try their vegan burger with the vegan bun. A little pricey here but tastes like fresh ingredients and quality ingredients, so worth the $27 bill with tip.",

Prices were higher than the Golden Arches or competitors but reasonable given the quality and service. I went with the single patty cheeseburger and fries. Delicious burgers, delicious fries. Perfectly messy. Perfectly cooked burger and fries. Excellent. Presentation was above what you d expect from a burger place. Washrooms were clean, accessible and gender neutral. Dining area was frequently cleaned by staff as soon as people were finished and leaving. I have no complaints and no areas to offer improvements, however, I did visit at 2:00pm on a Friday, your experience may differ depending on timing! Enjoy!",

Paris immediately comped our order this time and apologized. Again, no expectations and insisted he not but did so anyways - which was so kind of him. The staff kept saying we want to keep our customers happy. Super important and just adds to the amazing experience here. Fully recco this place- I ve had in and out and I ve had shake shack and this place lives up to the hype! We had it twice in one week -  .",

The small menu was actually a huge plus for me as it can get overwhelming when you have so many options. They have the classics and the quality is incredible. The burger was cooked perfectly. Id compare it to in-and-out burger but this is honestly way better because the bun doesnt get soggy. Fries are also the best (thin and crispy). Didnt have a shake but they looked delicious, will definitely try one next time Im there. Slightly sad I dont live closer, but slightly relieved because Im sure Id eat this multiple times a week if I did lol",

The beef was perfectly cooked, succulent and for a change, the patty is bigger than the bun, yes! The brioche was nice and soft with a nice bite. The brussels sprouts were perfectly roasted, and best of all, the fries are real french fries. We plan to designate ChitChat our official Burger restaurant. Wvee wvill beee back!",

We had never been to Chit Chats and we were amazed at everything about this restaurant from the food to the staff to the price. Oh and the chocolate cake was to die for. We ll be back  and certainly will recommend to others. Thank you for kicking off a very enjoyable evening",

There used to be a Blaze pizza here and when it closed I was so disappointed that I didn t bother to look at what replaced it. Upon a friend s prodding I went finally visited last weekend. The owner is Albanian and super friendly. They have a limited menu which they do really well. The food was so good that I went back the next day to have more. The patio is a bit cramped but that s with all the patios on Granville street. The street s ambiance makes up for it. The inside is very well done and the music and friendly service only add to the atmosphere. Over the two visits I ve ordered the veggie and the pulled chicken burgers, and the chulu chulu fries. Everything was exceptional. The burgers are SO cheap for a sit down restaurant but taste absolutely gourmet. Do check out their extensive section of dips that you can order with your food. I particularly liked the spicy feta dip. I m coming back here many more times for sure!",

Its the little sister of Hungry Guys across the street - totally different eats, but same great taste (everything made in house) and good value. Service was also a 10/10. Highlight 100% was the strawberry cheesecake milkshake!  They make the ice cream themselves! Tastes like a dairy Queen strawberry cheesecake Blizzard, but less sweet - perfect really, with a little sugar boost on the rim with some nostalgic nerd candies! If I could make a single suggestion...Id appreciate a music playlist with less profanity. Not to be a prude but I got sick of listening to F this F that on every.single.song.",

The staff was super welcoming and kind, seating us quickly and accommodating our request to sit inside. The burgers were so good, with their warm buttery buns and fresh homemade beef patties. The cocktails & beer selection were excellent. The service was fast and food was fresh when it arrived. Only minor issue was the kitchen failed to add requested toppings to the burger, which kind of sucked, but once we told the server he was super apologetic. Highly recommend chit chat burger bar!",

Every aspect of the burger is amazing, from the buttery bun to the homemade patties. Absolutely to die for. I m not joking. And for $6 who could complain? The ambiance is trendy and the music makes you want to dance. This is my new favourite spot in the heart of downtown. Almost didn t want to write this review so I could keep it my secret",

We were walking back and a rocket of a man, maybe in his late 40s with a grey ponytail, probably the owner, sorry I forgot your name bud, opened and closed us in a span of 3 seconds. Complimented the ladies we were with after checking their IDs and we were inside in a matter of seconds with our 10 people split group. Place is nice, with trees inside and your typical Philips hue coloured lights with salsa music and smiling waitresses. Good music and man oh man the burgers are cheap and good. Had the cheeseburger and fries. Nobody complained about the food and the prices. Apologies to the owner but he probably didn t expect us to get rowdy. We were all smushfaced. Money rained from the ceiling, baby Jesus floated down from the hue light saturated rafter and my life goals were instantly fulfilled. I can die happy, twice. Thanks, attractive pony tail man owner guy. We re still talking about how you 3 second closed a group of salespeople with your ridiculous charm to this day. Tl;dr: Door guy / owner is a rocket. Waitresses are units. Food is too good. I have no idea how they pay rent.",

Then, the burgers, oh boy...everything from the buns to the meat were tasty, flavorful, juicy and... just delicious! Worth every penny! Finally, but not the least important, the music! Who ever is the Dj in charge of those mixes... respect! Old school stuff combined with the new stuff, in a very pleasant summer beach-terrace-downtowny-nightclub combination made our dinner quite a delightful experience. Definitely coming back soon!",

Some surprising food (make their own churros for the chocolate churro milkshake...warm, crunchy, and sugary, mmm). The happy hour menu has great deals (enough mint in the mojito to take home and save for my own cooking). The ambience a nice surprise for this part of the strip and you wouldnt expect such a cool, comfortable, and fresh interior based on the outside.

Juicy patties with lots of filling, between two soft buns. The corn dog, on the other hand, is a bit disappointing. Its not as tasty as the burgers. Favourite dish(es): Chicken Cutlet, Teriyaki Burger Service: Usually, one person is behind the counter. Great customer service. Other Comments: Check out the Street Food Vancouver app for their locations and hours. Recommend: Definitely a yes!",

Theyve got Bin 4, which is phenomenal-- but theyre definitely in the premium range of burger restaurants, which you cant really compare with street food or fast food, especially considering the hefty price. Wakwak, despite not being a chain, hits that cheap, quality burger craving perfectly. For me, its a bit of a trip, but always worth stopping by whenever Im downtown. Tried 4 items on their menu and all of them were fantastic. And with burgers these good starting at 2.85, you really cant complain.",

You get a fresh-tasting burger, with the option of making it messy but even tastier with their sauce (and topping) options. With fries and a drink, it makes for a decent meal thats around $10. Their sweet mozzarella corn dog is an absolute treat that belongs at all fairs - a crunchy, sugary, donut-like exterior with a gooey cheesy centre (more cheese to dog ratio). Plus, the staff is so energetic and all smiles. I only wish they would sell weekly in front of my workplace..",

My personal favourite is the Americana, a great homage to the big Mac, but elevated to perfection. Sides are all solid. Onion rings are a big standout with their smokey-dilly batter. Good beer list as well, with rotating taps. Venue always has the game on. Whichever one your looking for. Lots of arcade machines well, with a wide range of pinball machines to choose from.",
