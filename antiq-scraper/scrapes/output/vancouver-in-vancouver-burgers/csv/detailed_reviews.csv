The fact that they give you free peanuts in shell and have their potato bags all around the store with the peanut oil which they fry it in just creates an awesome environment.

This trendy and cozy restaurant specializes in crafting gourmet burgers with a unique twist, and it certainly lived up to its reputation. First and foremost, the ambiance of Bin 4 Burger Lounge was inviting and contemporary. The interior was tastefully decorated with a combination of rustic and modern elements, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The seating arrangements were comfortable, and the staff was attentive and friendly, providing prompt service throughout my visit. Now lets talk about the star of the show the burgers. Bin 4 Burger Lounge offers an extensive selection of burgers, each with its own distinct flavor profile. From classic beef burgers to inventive vegetarian options, there is something to satisfy every palate. I opted for their signature Bin 4 Burger, and it did not disappoint. The patty was juicy, perfectly cooked, and seasoned to perfection. The toppings were fresh, and the brioche bun was soft and complemented the burger beautifully. The portion sizes were generous, ensuring that I left feeling completely satisfied. In addition to their impressive burger menu, Bin 4 Burger Lounge also offers a variety of tasty sides and appetizers. Their truffle Parmesan fries were a standout, with a delightful combination of flavors that elevated the dining experience. The restaurant also boasts a selection of craft beers and cocktails to complement the meal, adding another layer of enjoyment. While the overall dining experience at Bin 4 Burger Lounge was excellent, there were a few minor areas where improvements could be made. Firstly, the wait times during peak hours can be a bit long, so its advisable to make a reservation or plan your visit accordingly. Secondly, the pricing is slightly on the higher side, especially when considering the add-ons and sides. However, the quality of the ingredients and the exceptional flavors justify the price to a large extent. In conclusion, Bin 4 Burger Lounge is a must-visit spot for burger enthusiasts in Vancouver. With its inviting atmosphere, flavorful burgers, and attentive service, it delivers a memorable dining experience. While it may be a bit pricey, the quality and taste of the food make it worth the investment. I will definitely be returning to Bin 4 Burger Lounge for another mouthwatering burger adventure in the future. Our server was Jessi, and he is very friendly and his service was superb.

The burgers here arent so typical, they play around and try to create interesting flavors. I didnt get to try just a normal burger here, so I have no idea how they stack up for a purist, but the burgers we tried were really great. I tried the Minted Lamb burger and it was so delicious. The blue cheese stood out, but the eggplant and tomato relish brought some great sweetness that combined so well with the lamb. I would eat this burger again in a heart beat. My dining mates had the Big Dipper (a play on a beef dip, but with a burger) and the Bistro (a chicken, brie and bacon burger). Both were well received! Bin 4 lets you have your choice of aioli for dipping (normally for fries, but theyll still give it to you with a salad!) and it was so fun to try them out. Also, the happy hour is incredible. All their single cocktails are 5$, so we each tried one and Id love to come again and try more. Sorry for the unimpressive photos!

Normally when we eat out, we review the place we go in order to get the value out of quantity, quality, service and atmosphere. Bin 4 Burger Lounge did not disappoint, despite being a spontaneous choice with little if any review. We were greeted by a friendly staff and sat down on their patio, where a brief review of the specials and happy hour drinks, which was followed by what was included in the regular menu choices and what was extras or up-scaling. After receiving our drinks and complementary home made chips (or crisps) we ordered a Black and Blue burger with their fires and a Wild Mushroom with up-scaled onion rings, both of which came with our choice of aioli dipping sauce. The Black & Blue with the jalapeno aioli sauce was juicy and topped with fresh tomato and arugula as well as a small mound of sweet red onion relish. All the flavours were distinct and complementary, with each of the described ingredients tasting fresh. The fries, as good as they were, may have been a bit too much for the appetite behind the order, and thus the salads we saw were envied for the refreshment that was desired. You know how it is, who doesnt want fries with it; until youre too full for the last three bites. As for the Wild Mushroom, it too was a delight. I might also add that the bun was PERFECT on both burgers; light and airy with good texture and chew needed to keep everything together until the last bite. The beef patties were also meaty and juicy (dripping down the hand juicy - worthy of an extra napkin) with a nice char reminding us of a great summer bbq.  The toppings were generous and again fresh, especially since I am quite critical to mushroom burgers at other locations where they charge an extra 1.00 for 5 mushroom slices that taste like nothing. THIS burger came with its own mushroom mountain that tasted like they were picked, sliced and sauteed 5 minutes ago. I dont need to say much about their onion rings because if you look at others photos, you will notice consistency of complete and utter yumminess. The pictures do not lie, they redefine what an onion ring should be. And the aioli sauces . . . I am desiring to taste them all. The jalapeno dip was different enough from the bacon aioli that I could not decide which of the two I liked the best. If I had any complaint, it would have to be with the tomato garnish. This is not a complaint against Bin 4, since we are all subject to what the tomato farmers give us out of their greenhouses. Where have all the tomatoes from my childhood gone? They tasted like tomatoes! All in all, this was a delight and a gem to remember! I am glad we can still be spontaneous and still feel rewarded for the choices we make.",5 years ago,2018-12-01 01:52:16.161462,,,,0,135,255,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110992107045310914073/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

Its fair, considering there is a huge price gap between some of the vegetarian burgers and the much-coveted bison burger. FOOD: Always delicious. I would recommend staying away from the half-and-half option for combos as the portions for each come out to be smaller than if you just got a full order of either fries or salad. I went with my friend who rarely eats salads because of venomous hatred but he actually complimented the salad, which says something. DRINK: Lots of creative drink options but no free refills. During late night, you get 50% off a burger only if you purchase a drink so Ive ordered one religiously since coming. Some, like their Raspberry Lemon Fizz, are a miss.

The portions are massive here and will definitely fill you up. I typically go for a classic if Im not too hungry, a double if Im pretty hungry and a Daredevil (triple patty) if Im feeling dangerous.

That a steak sandwich has better steak than a standalone steak at other restaurants. The ribeye steak was incredibly tender. And you get a lot of it (1.5 steaks?) stuffed into one sandwich. Need to start a new paragraph to talk about the truffle fries, which were amazing. Cut like thick chips. Thickly crispy on the outside, soft in the middle. Dressed in a truffle parmesan sauce. This was close to the best fries/chips Ive ever had, and Im a connoisseur. Even the salad is worth mentioning as it had a tasty dressing with crispy (fried garlic?) topping.

They used to not smash their burger and it was insane but they were forced to smash all of them or something, still, 5 star burgers. The chicken fingers, you have to get them hot and fresh right away, are literally the best in the world. No seriously, they are simply incredible. Delicately juicy but with the perfect thin crunch, unbelievable. For fries go with the truffle fries, bomb, they also make for great munchie chips for later. (They keep in the fridge overnight, which is not possible to say about regular french fries). I still need to try the cheesesteaks etc., but i wont be able to resist the chicken fingers again next time i order out, i cook a lot at home and know my spots, this is one of a very select few that are at the top of the list.

Firstly, kudos to brother Zuhair for his amazing service. We went close to the closing time, and the restaurant was packed but he made sure we had our food before they close for the night. Vonns serve undoubtedly the most flavorful items. We tried the double patty beef burger and the Vonns special cheesesteak. The patties of the burger were juicy enough, and cooked to the perfection. The bun was soft but not soggy. The fries complimented the burger and made the meal wholesome. The cheesesteak was equally delicious. Will we visit this restaurant again?

Amazing food! One of the greatest hospitalities I have ever seen! I think it was the owner himself going around, welcoming and talking about the specials to every guests on every table. When he heard that it was our first time dining in at Vonns, he suggested that we dont take combos with each meal but get one dish to share and when we chose truffle fries, he said they will ne on the house! He made sure to take our feedback after we finished eating (we couldnt exactly finish those large portions, so we had to pack up the leftovers!). My steak was medium instead of the rare medium that it was supposed to be (it still tasted great!). The man apologized profusely for this tiny mistake and did not charge me for my entire meal and made me promise that I visit a second time for the perfect buttery medium rare steak. I never messaged because it felt like ripping off a small business. But when I posted a review on Facebook, they messaged me themselves with the voucher for free meals for 2. They really make you feel special! Thank you Vonns for making our first visit (potentially of many) an excellent experience! They deserve more than 5/5!

It was pretty busy, but not too crowded. The burgers there are huge and looked soo delicious. We ordered the new launched steak. Its called steak frites. Its not on the menu yet, it was super yummy! I would recommend it anytime. They normally make the steak medium, then u can have it with fries or the potato slices thing, forgot what its called, and it comes with sauces its so good. The steak was so soft and tender. Its halaal too, for those who need to know...It was delicious, it comes with ketchup and chipotle sauce and garlic sauce. Parking is on the street, so stones becomes difficult to find. Staff are very friendly. The meat runs out, so call in before you come to check if they are open and still have their meat.

Fantastic. We all ate too much after enjoying our food, which is always the best indication of good comfort food. I enjoyed a massive burger with double most things and added deep fried jalapenos, also had a side of fries, more jalapenos, and poutine and a shake. All hit the spot - burger was juicy and cooked fresh, fries crisp, and I ended up only eating a quarter of my poutine because my kids fought over the rest and didn t share. Both kids say they would return, and their only complaint was the food was so good the ate until they felt ill. Serves them right. A bit more expensive than your regular fast food place, or their that other burger place down the street, but it s worth it.

We grab dinner here regularly and hv tried most of the items on the menu. Our favourites are the the onion rings, poutine & Buffalo Chicken burger. So good!! We have also ordered it via Uber Eats and it came super fast. The onion rings r fresh and crispy. The fries and poutine are delish. Lots of gravy and cheese. The Buffalo chicken has a sauce on it that is awesome. Not too spicy but just enough kick to give it an amazing flavour. The best thing about this spot, when going in person, is the service. The ladies who work here are very family oriented in the sense that they are personable and remember you when you return.

A really good burger.  A spectacular and indulgent burger. Yelp saves me in these situations, so I did a search and headed over to Veras.  Parking was really easy to find on the street.  (Side note: I love parking in Vancouver because it is so easy to do with credit cards.  The flashing green traffic lights I still dont understand...)  I got a little nervous about the outside because the awning is ostentatious and still doesnt really stand out compared to what is next to it, but then I went inside. With hockey playing on four screens, this feels like a very Canadian way of eating a burger, but somehow it doesnt feel too sports-bar-like.  Clean and open, it is easy to read the menus and order.  The cashier was very friendly and told me she would bring the food to me. I ordered sweet potato fries and they were perfect; both crispy and hot. This is a rarity for sweet potato fries, which I can never figure out.  If they have good breading, they arent hot; if they are hot, they dont taste good.  Somehow, Veras pulled it off. The burger was also great. I ordered the works and pulled a few things off because it was so big.  A very sweet, gruff-voiced attendant (possibly the owner) checked on me to see if they needed to fix the order, although it was perfect.  He checked on me at the end, too.  The entire time I was eating, he was constantly cleaning and taking care of tables.  Really incredible service and attention.

I sat at home watching their instagram stories of people snapping photos of their burgers and fries. Yesterday night, I had enough, it was time to try out Hundy. First impressions, the music playlist really sets the vibe of the whole place. I love how they converted this place into a restaurant at night and a coffee shop by day. I also like that the take my phone number and text me when my table is ready approach. It s a counter service restaurant (like PDX restaurants) so while we waited for our table we ordered beers. Their beers are constantly changing but I had the Farmhouse 33 Acres experiment beer and it was amazing. It s a very refreshing IPA without too many hops and fruity flavours. Alright, 4th paragraph in, I should start talking about the food. I ordered the bacon cheese burger with fries. The sauce in the burger is what makes this burger amazing. It s hard to explain what it is, but their secret sauce is boss. Bun, patty, veg, and cheese were all great sidekicks in this burger. But, the true Robin to the Batman were the fries. These fries  their like my crown jewel of fries  places like Cockney Kings and other OG fish and chips places. You think you come here for the burger, but when you leave  the fries are what you think about. My buddy Bryan ordered the bacon poutine with a chicken burger. I tried the poutine and must say it was worth the $7. As for his review of the chicken burger, he said,  I ll be back. . Once I posted the pics on IG, the DMs exploded with,  How was it?

He explained what they offered and also made suggestions and pondered mixing and match sauces with us. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with the Hundy sauce and a poutine. We didn t have to wait long and they provide you with a buzzer so you know when your order is ready. I was amazed with the food and absolutely loved it.

It was a cold dark rainy night (seriously, sept 24, 8pm, it was raining). My partner and I were standing outside the omelettery, puzzled by the burger sign, as we tried to open up the qr code menu on our phones. The owner, Sina, flung open the front door and welcomed us to look at the menu inside. He then took us on a journey on how his burger ingredients were sourced, prepared and served. All of which, was brimming with excitement and passion. You could really tell Sina was really proud of what he and his team were slinging. His pitch made us forget we were walking over from having dessert. We had to try one, even though we were full. We got the juicy original burger, and we enjoyed it next to our car, under the lights of a carpet store. So I cant say for sure how well it holds up for delivery or long transport. The beef: smash-seared perfectly. Not too thin that you get jerky. Smashed enough so you get a crisp meaty crust but the center is still juicy. The bun: airy, light, not soggy or falling aparty.

It was genuinely the best I ve ever had and I ve had my fair share of burgers across the country. We re traveling from out of province and looking for something to eat. I have to say one of the best foods I ve had throughout our entire trip to Vancouver. The buns were so soft and the patty tasted extremely delicious and slightly crispy which was perfect. The flavours were incredible. I got the Pineapple Express burger and my friend got the regular cheese burger and both were crazy good. I was tempted to buy another. Enough that we went back and tried their poutine. I really liked it. I love how they added onions to top it off. The gravy flavour is great.

We couldn t find it at first but after driving around where it was supposed to be, we found it. They only do take out as they don t have their own place yet. The customer service was amazing, the owner was there and he chatted with us while we were waiting for our food and gave us great recommendations. All the food on the menu was carefully thought out and some of the ingredients were highly sourced out as well. The workers there had really great knowledge of the menu as well and recommended us on what their favourite things were on the menu and I m so glad we listened to them. We ordered the yam fries and they were really good, the house mayo was the best as it was super creamy! For our mains we ordered the truffle mushroom burger and the mushroom blue and I only have great things to say, the mushroom blue is by far the BEST burger I ve ever had and the truffle burger comes second! We also ordered cookies and they gave it to us on the house and that was a really nice touch! If you ever come to Vancouver, you guys need to try this place out, you won t regret it!

Let me start off by saying the food is 10/10 and I have NEVER had a smash burger as tasty as Juicy Joes! I have lived in California and have been all over USA and tried several different burgers but these guys nailed the recipe. The burger and it s ingredients are completely fresh and it literally melts in your mouth when you take a bite. The onions are caramelized to perfection, the meat is exceptional quality, with a crunchy and golden brown texture, and the American cheese + bun is to die for. Literally the best Ive had in my entire life. The owner Cena is a charismatic and very passionate man whose hospitality is very welcoming. He is a very kind man who is always smiling and going above and beyond with his service. All the chefs and employees and extremely hard working with the best energy ALWAYS. Do not miss this hidden gem, it deserves all the flowers, reviews, and appreciation. I eat here a few times every week and cannot get enough!

It wasn t like I was having a bad day when I happened to happen upon the hallowed halls of Joe s storied kitchen, I was just feeling generally kind of listless in life. Which is arguably worse. However, as I m sure you ve already guessed, my dear, hungry, hamburger loving reader, all of my malaise and ennui melted away as soon as Juicy Joe s delightfully classic cheeseburger entered my universe. The carefully selected, locally sourced ingredients, the meticulous manner in which each culinary element worked in concert to create a definitively delectable and singularly scrumptious consumption experience, and ultimately the marvellous man behind the magical sandwich all helped to remind me that there are so many things to live for. To live is to aspire to lofty goals and then pursue them with as much tenacity as kindness. With as much fierce perseverance as brotherly understanding. With all your mind and all your heart.

The person at the till was super helpful with recommendations and I went with all his recommendations. What I ordered: Veggie style Cheese Burger, Single patty (Recommend) $11.50 Combo: Fries and a Orange Milkshake (Recommend) $11 This veggie burger hit all the spots for flavour, their in house sauce laying under fresh tasty veggies and the veggie patty was satisfying, slightly crispy but not greasy in a brioche bun. Highly recommend, the burger was super filling so warning the fries were very tasty as well but it was quite a lot! They fresh cut their fries thin like McDonald s but tastes so much better, crispy, thin and not as greasy. To top off my order I wanted to try their milkshakes. Staff had reco the orange milkshake and what a pleasant surprised that turned out to be! Reminds me of a cream soda orange pop but in a creamy milkshake version! Overall everything was super tasty, I d recommend taking your order to go if you re making it a combo but the burger itself was good enough.

There used to be a Blaze pizza here and when it closed I was so disappointed that I didn t bother to look at what replaced it. Upon a friend s prodding I went finally visited last weekend. The owner is Albanian and super friendly. They have a limited menu which they do really well. The food was so good that I went back the next day to have more. The patio is a bit cramped but that s with all the patios on Granville street. The street s ambiance makes up for it. The inside is very well done and the music and friendly service only add to the atmosphere. Over the two visits I ve ordered the veggie and the pulled chicken burgers, and the chulu chulu fries. Everything was exceptional. The burgers are SO cheap for a sit down restaurant but taste absolutely gourmet. Do check out their extensive section of dips that you can order with your food.

Complimented the ladies we were with after checking their IDs and we were inside in a matter of seconds with our 10 people split group. Place is nice, with trees inside and your typical Philips hue coloured lights with salsa music and smiling waitresses. Good music and man oh man the burgers are cheap and good. Had the cheeseburger and fries. Nobody complained about the food and the prices. Apologies to the owner but he probably didn t expect us to get rowdy. We were all smushfaced. Money rained from the ceiling, baby Jesus floated down from the hue light saturated rafter and my life goals were instantly fulfilled. I can die happy, twice. Thanks, attractive pony tail man owner guy. We re still talking about how you 3 second closed a group of salespeople with your ridiculous charm to this day. Tl;dr: Door guy / owner is a rocket.
