Even doordash and uber eats receive their deliveries from the security officer making it even more professional. Now I can tell the management worked hard to re- establish this place. I really hope this place holds their security officer which is very polite and professional. I also hope other McDonalds with busy downtown traffic to employ security officers , especially once covid is over and night clubs re opens.",3 years ago,2020-12-01 01:46:17.749327,,,,0,64,127,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100558155610835972967/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

You basically select what you one, finish the order, pay by card or get the ticket and pay at the counter. They also do make your own gourmet burger. I was quite skeptical about this, but I must say Im quite impressed with the quality of the burger. The beef patty was juicy and the rest of the ingredients were fresh. Its a bit pricier compared to the usual menu, but totally worth it.

I parked the car and went into the store from the main entrance (not the small entrance thats next to the parking lot) because my friend was waiting for me at that door. I tried to dispute the parking ticket with Royal Parkings and explained the situation, even attached my receipt. The appeal department replied and said as long as I left the parking lot Id need to pay for the ticket. I actually walked straight to the restaurant and spent an hour in there with food and drinks from McDonalds, but still need to pay for the ticket just because I went through a different door?

This McDonald s location has been a pillar of the community for 50+ years. I come here randomly and honestly consider every experience on par or better than most other locations.

ChIJd7pHyHtzhlQR9d68GQ7l70A,McDonald's,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN5ejVLcWlRRRAB,Cohen McHale-Fleming,5,This McDonalds is always a treat. The staff are all very friendly and you get the standard McDonalds taste we all expect.....but theres more. This is single handedly the MOST ENTERTAINING McDonalds Ive ever been in. The perpetual state of neutral chaos going on at this location is worth the $1.89+ price of admission. Pre-Pandemic Id go in on a Friday night just to see the equivalent of a performance art production. New Years Eve (in years without a global pandemic) is truly a spectacular event with 100s of drunk youngster (of age presumably) getting their McD****s fix. If you visit and you get poor service or they mess up your order dont sweat it. Its a small price to pay for a uniquely bustling experience!,2 years ago,2021-12-01 01:46:45.831600,,,,0,18,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110280581569147672119/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

It is Nov 13th 2016 in the afternoon. Its not terribly busy, theres 2 floors with the upstairs hosting one of the rare play places, and the service is on point. I walked in, saw the digital ordering kiosks. I love how amazingly powerful they are. Dont forget that you can tap on an order and hit Customize to go crazy with the most granular possible nit picky stuff you can think of.  Today the Build Your Taste burger builder was fully integrated and let me absolutely get the details I wanted. Once the order was complete it got me to pick up an elecronic device known as a Table Tracker, this allowed me to bring my kid upstairs to the play place with my number and pretty close after ordering two gentlemen came upstairs with my order on a wooden paddle, and my daughters happy meal carried separately and carefully. The men asked us if we wanted any condiments, to which we asked for ketchup to which they happily obliged. No restaurant, especially fast food, has evolved over time quite like McDonalds. I though McCafe was a pretty big deal when it came around but now McDonalds seems to be catering to thise who want real food, with real service one could experience at a standard family restaurant.  Except i dont have to wait 35 minutes to an hour gor my order to come about. I imagine it wont be like this all the time, in fact im pretty sure to expect just like what happened to FatBurger.

I have talked to you multiple times due to very bad management that I faced in your store, but today I wanted to congratulate you with hiring -Pegah-. What amazing customer service she provided to me today. Honestly, this was the best level of service I have ever received in any fast food. I can tell the level of customer service was in a level of a high end luxury dine in restaurants. There was a big mistake that happened at the drive thru by one of your employees and after I got to the payment window, I saw -Pegah- already there to make sure there is nothing to get mistaken, she actively listened and apologized to me for the mistake without me even get upset, so at the point that I found that I have been taken care of to get  the right food, I was even thinking about time, mistakes and getting angry. It was an amazing feeling I have received when I got taken care of not only for the money that I paid extra and the wrong sandwich, but she kindly provided me with free apple pie and asked me to keep the wrong sandwiches even though I didnt order them. As a long term manager in retail, I want to thank you (Mina) for getting amazing people like -Pegah- hired in your team and thank -Pegah- for her amazing service. I want to let you know that I just bought my items less than half an hour ago, but I found it will be so unfair to not mention this to everyone with this level of customer service.

ChIJyzUnALfbhVQRAiFQh_AqAu0,McDonald's,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM2bDk2S2FnEAE,Amy T,5,Big SHOUT to Brandon(girl manager on sept 14 9pm 2021) If you see this thank you for being manager because someone needs to learn. She was the second manager I talked to and was understanding. The first one I talked to told me to hold and passed me over to Brandon. Brandon did a good job of understanding what the situation was. Ps: Sorry if I spelled your name wrong Ps: To the other manager if you see this I hope you learn stuff Ps: I give 5 stars to the manager not to the store for she did the right thing at the right time My parents always get told off because they cant understand people and today there was something wrong with the order in which they actually give a coupon and showed the cashier what they wanted but they did the wrong order and was quite rude about not changing it for them.(they did in the end but it was still more expensive when they asked for a different burger) My parents told me when they got home. And I was livid with this happening at McDonald when they should be trained better then anyone. I know for a fact there training for staff is great so dont know where customer service went with some of the people in the store!!!,2 years ago,2021-12-01 01:49:20.201833,,,,0,8,1,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101161765579463066717/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

That is DISGUSTING...there are signs that say no smoking/vaping. Theres also basic human decency and common sense that dictate that you dont force your disgusting habit on others....but common sense is seriously lacking these days, as I think we can all agree.

There are two self-serve screens inside and a small bathroom on the ground floor. There are also two small tables at the front of the first floor but 5 outdoor tables. There s a sign that says personal reusable cups are encouraged and also a sign outdoors that says outdoor seating is for patrons only.

And naturally its very hard to clean when theyre busy most of the time. You will notice people struggling with the door because they are not sure its locked from inside or staff locked it.

Everything was super tasty: the chicken was well cooked with an amazing chargrill flavour (until we tasted yours, we had given up the idea of being able to eat a good rotisserie chicken in Vancouver), the garlic mashed potatoes was really well seasoned, the garlic bread was good though the portion was a bit small, the fries were good quality and the best of the meal was definitely the natas... So perfect! Im a former pastry chef and can tell you these little treats are paradise - theres a crispy crust, the whole thing is then melting in your mouth and you can only become addicted to this amazing taste!!

Despite the food taking longer than expected, the staff simply came down and told me it would take a bit longer, which was totally fine. I appreciated them coming down, and thats all they had to prevent small little thing like delayed food turning into a disaster experience. The food was delicious once it arrived! Well worth the wait. I ordered the half chicken and peri fries. I think they even gave me extra chicken because of the wait. Some of the nicest I have ever tasted! Freshly cooked and succulent.

It often feels a little depressing when you walk in the door and you can see it in the staffs demeanor. One day I walked in for a cold dessert and encountered the bubbliest, happiest, the most joyful employee I have ever encountered. Even with her mask on, I can tell she was smiling ear to ear as she took my order. It felt very welcoming and it was a nice change. The way she would communicate with her coworkers, with so much respect and care, showed me that her demeanor is genuine. The amount of joy she was putting out was radiating throughout the place and I picked up on it. I was having a long day (hence why I came in for the dessert) and she totally changed my mood. Justine is going places and making a lot of people happy in the process. If management sees this review please let Justine know how much of a difference she is making at your location.

I used to get breakfast here a couple of times a week and eventually one of the ladies started recognising me and remembering my order and I would usually just have to confirm between two items that I always ordered. I am now working from home so I no longer go there, but I sometimes miss my little routine and receiving great customer service! Previous review: This is one of the worst locations Ive been to in Vancouver.  There are two women here that are part of the morning crew who give the most horrendous service I have ever experienced and one of them is a supervisor/manager. They dont know how to listen and as a result they get my order wrong...often. Theres nothing complicated about ordering a McMuffin without cheese and two hashbrowns. When I order coffee, they get the size or number of creams wrong. This isnt Starbucks and Im not ordering a complicated drink but somehow a simple cup of coffee gets messed up almost every time. They often ring in my order wrong and I have to repeat myself two or three times before they get it right and they like to argue with me as if Im doing something wrong. I speak perfect English and they seem to as well, but clearly their listening skills are lacking.",a year ago,2022-12-01 01:48:26.337309,,,,3,48,5,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101378747282788679040/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

The food overall tasted great! The only thing is the onion rings were too salty  inedibly salty. A staff came by every once in a while and checked to make sure everything was still good and we had everything we wanted. Overall great experience at this A&W.
