I highly recommend Fright Nights for Halloween, they add haunted houses and actors to bring the Halloween experience alive! There are rice and haunted house wait times but it s worth the wait. The park is especially beautiful at night when everything is lit up. There is fun theme park food options and rides for a range of ages and comfort levels.

While the overall enjoyment was high, there were a few hiccups along the way. One aspect that could be improved is the pricing. The entry fees and the requirement for thrill passes can add up, making it a bit pricey for families. Additionally, some of the rides, including the wooden roller coaster and the hellevator, were out of service during our visit. This resulted in longer lines for the kid-friendly rides, which was a bit frustrating. On a brighter note, the farm exhibition was a big hit with the kids. The variety of animals, from cows to water buffalo, offered a fantastic learning experience. The magic show, pig races, and the real knight fight with horses were thrilling and entertaining. Plus, the free ice cream was a delightful treat. The PNE does offer a silver lining in that you can enjoy the shows and exhibitions with just a general admission ticket, which is a money-saving option. Despite a few setbacks, our day at the PNE was filled with memorable family moments and a wide range of entertainment options, making it a worthwhile destination for families looking for a fun day out.",a month ago,2023-10-25 14:09:29.786626,,,,1,140,226,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117511985752571229471/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

Recommend the Rapid Pass ride option to save countless hours of waiting on line for the ride of your choice, with some lines being 1-3 hour wait makes the rapid pass the best way to go with limited amount of passes available per day. Ride pass is separate from gate pass so be sure to purchase both tickets with rapid pass upgrade available at the ride ticket purple roof booths, haunted house or the odd ride attraction are not covered under ride passes or PNE gift cards with a separate individual charge per person. Have fun and enjoy everything that PNE has to offer!

Plus there was limited capacity which was fine, no long line ups. There was live music shows all day. We seen Super Dogs, my fav. The pyrotechnics & firework show was Amazing!! At one point the fireworks blasted strait into the audience. Of course, it had a designated safety point to land at but it sure felt like we were goin to get blasted. Id def. see that again, and for free. Spectacular!!The food vendors had a good variety of food, like BBQ, tacos, hotdogs, burgers, fries, oh and dont forget, the best viewing homemade in ur face, just before leaving fresh warm mini donuts. There was anime store selling mystery bags, kids thought it was awesome. Booking online for admission and ride wrist bands made it alot easier, didnt have long lineups.

Within playland proper you have all the carnival games you could desire, some decent food options, mini golf, and honestly a pretty dope selection of rides. The wooden rollercoaster is still my favourite coaster of all time, rivalled only by the cyclone at cony island (similar vibe).

For the past few years, they are closed on Mondays due to lack of attendance in past fairs. There are many ways in saving for admission. They do offer free admission days (X2 days), library day (show a valid library card), VanCity members (show your VanCity Credit Union card) and so on. Just check PNE.ca for deals. Parking is $20 unless you want to pay the little old ladies hawking parking spots on their properties. Transit is also good too. Free parking is available, just have to look for them about several blocks away (just make sure you pay attention to the street signs, or else pay $150 parking fine!) Games? Different games offer different prizes. Maybe I didnt notice in previous years, but the smaller kid games is guaranteed a prize. More or less, you are paying for the stuff animal. So, $5 gets a small prize to $20 get you a jumbo one. I think this is such a smart move on the PNE Fair, cuz its a money grabber but also, encourage kids to play!? My game that I play is whack-a-mole. Scored 2 jumbo stuffed animals for $10, but you need at least 9-11 players. Food? Beer? Drinks? Always expensive. The mini donuts have gone up in price this year. It 1 bag $5, 2 for $10 or 3 for $13. In 2018, it was 3 bags for $10! I guess oil has gone up! But, overall, its the experience. Marketplace? What amazes me is people go nuts for the steam mops, air coolers, chair massagers. Toon City? A different children experience. My kids highlight of the day. The dancers were awesome especially this one lone guy. Then another show on the Super Academy. Very eventful. Barn yard: same thing every year, barn animals, discovery kids tour to horse riding, blacksmith show and so on. So thankful for the sinks to wash those hands!? Rides? I cant say much on this, as my kids a bit young for them. Sure, they got children rides, but its super pack. I would rather come during Playland when its quieter and shorter lines!? Arcade? Its gone. Boarded up and the main entrance is block by the how strong you can hit game. Dog show? The stroller parking is crazy. Great to park it, crazy after the show. The staging area is now 3/4 the ice rink. Which means less seats. White Spot is in the Coliseum, so you can eat in an air condition seating area! Concerts? Two concerts. The paid one vs the free ones. The paid ones reserved seats  vs general admission)  happens at 830pm, namely a past headliner. This years headliner were Billy Idol, Smokey Robinson, Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer, TLC (although, Lisa Lopez passed away, so its only TC), etc. The free ones are basically bands playing radio hits. Not bad actually. Either case, you can find a spot and guarantee you can enjoy the music still. One thing I did notice for 2019 is the PNE has upgraded its fairgrounds. How? New blacktop among some of the rides, newer looking amusement games. PNE is amazing at night with the games and rides shining through. Before I go, and I always wanted to work at the PNE so I can say, win a house, win a car, get your tickets here!",4 years ago,2019-11-25 14:09:35.526965,,,,3,145,376,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110192453260705995943/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,
