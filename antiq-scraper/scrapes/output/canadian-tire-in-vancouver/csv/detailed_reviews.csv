ChIJs8lGyt1zhlQRssgeHveYgiU,Canadian Tire,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGZzQyZTZRRRAB,Lin Lin,5,"It was a great service with Canadian tire center! We had a nail on one of our rear tire. We went to costco, bigotire and Mr. lube to get opinions. We were told that we had to replace all 4 tires without even checking. But we just replace a brand new front tire a year ago and only drove less than 3000 Km since. Costco was the worst of all! They were so impatience and told us they had to replace all four tires because they had to be the same brands because they did not carry my tires brand. Their attitude was the worst!  Canadian tire was our last store to get opinion on.  Gensis, Nash and Steven were very helpful and Gensis was very patience with us. He explained a lot of things to us and help us understand the situation. After listening to our story, Gensis told us that they would first check if our tire was repairable then offered options if it was not.  Both Costco and Mr. Lube never even bothered to do what Canadian tire did. They just assumed that we had a nail and all our four tires were needed to be replaced. Gensis at Canadian tire is such a nice guy and a great supervisor/manager I assumed. He went an extra mile for the customer and put our best interest first! As a business owner myself, I really think it is hard to find a great employee like Gensis these days.  In the end, it turned out to be that our tire only needed a patch. It only cost us 70 dollar! At Costco, they quoted us for almost $3000 to replace all tires. We will for sure go back to Canadian for future replacement!

I had quite the experience here over the past month, which started from me trying to simply get my seasonal tire change done. A lot went wrong, but, each time, the service advisors were extremely helpful in explaining why and how, and doing their best to make it right. Which they did. Due strictly to their fantastic service (specifically, Laura and Daniel, A+), this shop gets a no-questions 5/5. Good customer service is the single most important aspect of a successful business, in my opinion, and here it was knocked out of the park. If things go wrong and time is lost to visits where nothing gets done, a good service advisor can make all the difference. When the job finally got done, it got done right, so no issues there. It ended up with me buying a new set of tires and the aligning/balancing that goes with that.

I usually like to look over the discount plant shelf to see if theres anything there that Im care to try to rescue. I ended up picking up two plants (one 5 cm & 10 cm) n the bigger one was almost dried out. I decided to dunk it in a large container nearby that was filled with water n it had a watering can. After I was done n was trying to get out of the closely packed area, a staff member noticed that I picked up some discount plants n complimented me on trying to rescue some of them. After a short conversation, she ended up offering me two of the small 5 cm plants for free as her Xmas gift to me as it was clear that it easily made me happy. Her name was Pat n she said that why not make someone happy if its easy for her to do so n wished me Merry Xmas. I was very pleased with her kindness and wished her the same. TYVM again Pat giving me such a great experience. One more thing, I dont really enjoy being made to use the self check out machines n sincerely wish that theres an option to purchase products from a humin cashier.

I use to go to the market crossing one but due to their being more of a firearms and hunting section at bentall location I started going here. First off joe from the hunting sectional is a phenomenal character and well versed and knowledgeable on almost all firearms and  goods!  His passionate level of service has kept me coming back to browse and shop there for the past year! The sporting good section has an amazing selection and mostly well stocked in what ever you need! He helped me pick out a required firearm and even introduced me to local areas and groups. My second Major deciding factor or point is the Automotive service section.  I had the fortunate luck to notice a problem before a long trip at this location and after being looked at by a third party in the parking lot I rushed into Canadian tire to see if it was service able that weekend!

As my family was preparing to leave for a camping trip early the next morning, we discovered our roof box was broken beyond repair, and since we don t camp light, getting a replacement was crucial.

I called in ahead of time to make sure they had an item because I had a terrible experience at another Canadian Tire location. You could hear that it was busy but Ward went out of his way to provide exceptional customer service. He asked for the item number and had support to make sure the item was available. He confirmed it was and told me what aisle it was in and the location where it would be in the aisle. I walked in, purchased the item and walked out within 5 minutes. My background to the whole experience below. I wanted to pick up Settlers of Catan and saw there were 7 available at the Cambie & 7th location. I went to the location and it took forever to find someone for support. When I did find someone, they told me it wasn t their department and to find the other rep. I found the other rep and had to chase after him as it felt like he was trying to avoid helping clients. Odd when you are hired to help clients. When I asked him about it he said if they are not on the shelf then it s going to be in a box somewhere as they are redoing their toy section. There were a bunch of boxes around the area but he was not even willing to walk over and look on the shelves or even offer to look into a couple of the boxes of items. He just said he can t help and smirked. I am purchasing this item as a family member of a friend of mine is battling cancer. This was a gift to bring their family together through the battle as I heard it s getting tougher at the moment. I was so angry that no one was willing to help. They were clearly unorganized and understaffed.",3 years ago,2020-11-21 21:39:11.282596,Ward sure is amazing and were glad you think so too Jamie.

Wow! I also purchased a magic bullet brand personal blender on sale for $29.95. This place is a wonderful store for incredible buys. I come often to purchase specials from their flyers when there are things we need. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable.

Lots of ample parking everywhere and they also have a good selection of live plants at this one but not as good as Cambie. What I really liked about this location is that they have their patio/outdoor furniture setup and on display. This way you can test out the furniture to see if it s what you were envisioning online. The other CTs don t really do this so this one was great for that. One thing though is this one doesn t have any self checkout stations and there was a huge lineup and only one person jumped on to another cashier to help the one cashier for the longest time.

He also offered me two options to replace it: let their machinists do that for me (charge 68$) or by myself. In order to save the money, I chose to do that by myself.

Now i have seen alot of repairs on my own vehicles over the years and spentalot of time wrenching my trucks in the parking lot just like my dad would do . And my favorite part as a kid was getting to keep the canadian tire money. Over the years its been growing into a great all round needs kinda store there house brand is become very compeditive with the big name power tools and at a price way below which is a good thing for the low budget people or if you are just a tight wad like my self . They have a great spray paint selection for those small paint jobs or brush on or larger sprayer paints as well as all your paint accessories.  The auto motive section is large and user friendly lay out for the self serve types or if you need help well good luck on fast service and when you get it its rare to find an employee wllling to solve your needs if they dont have what you need .that being said  i think over all this world would not be the same without canadian tire .

This is a brilliant opportunity to find great deals on clearance sales as the store shifts its shelves they have lowered prices on items that have not been selling or the remainder of seasonal products.

There are a couple of really amazing managers who treat the customers well and the staff seem content which probably means they are given the respect they deserve. All in all Canadian Tire is my favorite store and it is amazing that this fanchise has given their customers rewards since the begining. Canadian Tire money is the first reward system and that has changed our retail experience because now all stores have reward programs.

ChIJWfs4UCd1hlQRwicuhMyeR5s,Canadian Tire,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ0c2VMVmZREAE,Steve Whalley,5,This Canadian tire has some really helpful staff and they are quite knowledgeable. I asked where I could find a certain item and  the Canadian Tire staff member led me to the isle and the item. That was definitely a time saver. When i saw the price listed i was not so sure i wanted to spend quite that much money on it and I said that to the him. He said let me do a price check on the item and he said i was in luck. He had located the item advertized in a competitors store and he offered a Price Match.  I was pleasantly surprised and bought the item. Its part of their gaurantee. There is lots of parking there and the store is always stocked up with everything you could want and they bring in lots of items to match the current season as well. They also have mechanics ready to do repairs or install new tires and batteries headlights and more.Please Like to show me I am making a difference.

ChIJJcUQNMtzhlQRVUZkJrhLGkI,Canadian Tire Auto Service Centre,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQwbklYZDZRRRAB,Titus Cheung,5,"Hello I d like to express the greatest gratitude to Johnny Ray Ritchie and his team of specialists for having brought my vehicle back to running condition and returned it to my property over the weekend.  The team was knowledgeable, transparent, and went the extra mile to order the necessary parts from out of country or did the repair if possible when parts are no longer available.  Despite me being only in town only during the month of Aug I was kept updated via email every step along the way and work continued long after I left for another 2 months. The vehicle involved is a 91 deVille which had sat idled for around 5 years with numerous issues.  It had a decomposed flat tire, dead battery, engine wouldn t start even when jumped, and inoperative windows.  It was towed in with an objective of bringing it back to road running condition. After initial diagnostic it was discovered the fuel tank was cracked and the fuel pump was non functional.  I was advised up front the potential of finding additional faults so the hidden costs may exceed the vehicle s worth such that I was able to make an informed decision and set the correct expectations. Since then the team went on to identify additional faults.  The AC compressor and power steering fluid line were replaced.  For the pulley system it was initially suspected that both the AC compressor and water pump pulleys were faulty.  I was expecting both to be replaced but the team took the extra time to confirm only the AC compressor pulley needed work.  For the windows switches, they investigated both buying original parts removed from other vehicles vs disassembling the mechanical switches to try repairing themselves.  They decided to try the latter to save costs for the parts. Worth mentioning is a vehicle like this wouldn t have been able to be serviced if it was brought into the dealership.  Not knowing when I d be back in the country next a scheduled reminder have been put on my profile so a quote will be sent to me a year from now for the vehicle to be towed back in for its next annual maintenance. As a customer I was not only impressed with the team doing what they needed to do to get the vehicle repaired given the scarcity of parts, I was also extremely pleased with the way Johnny managed it, and did what he could to keep the costs down.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS STORE. This store do not even deserve 1 star after having that conversation with that horrible human being. I am about to purchase over a thousand dollar set of tires online for my vehicle and called the AUTOMOTIVE service and see how much would they charge for tire change. Whoever answer that call from AUTOMOTIVE department must be fired if Canadian Tire DONT wanna lose future loyal customers. I can guarantee that HE do not care about Canadian Tire as a company as he do not care about me trying to spend over a thousand dollars for this store. I am just trying to ask some legitimate questions and just want 30 seconds of his time but he chose to hang up on me for he said he is busy. I was even polite to ask him to please bear with me as I am looking for the correct information of my car to avoid confusion but he instead just hang up like a CHILD who has TEMPER TANTRUMS. If He don t care about me who is about to spend over a thousand dollars to  bring business to the company in exchange for 30 seconds of his paid time by the Canadian Tire, I m wondering how he treat those customers who spend less than that. To the extremely RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL person who answered my call, my TIME is as precious as your time SIR! If you do not wish to answer legitimate questions from customers then clearly youre in the wrong business and if you hate getting calls then QUIT YOUR JOB to spare Canadian Tire an embarrassment and losing business for having YOU. You are dragging down some good employee from this store and that how selfish of you. Mopping floor as a job do not require answering calls from customers just to give you an idea. Im wondering how the elders are treated when they call this store and you happen to be on the other line. To the executive officers and Shareholders of Canadian Tire who are reading this,  youre setting your bar really really low for having this horrible PERSON representing your company. I am a loyal Canadian Tire customer and now I will also cancel my triangle Mastercard. I will promise not to bring business to this company EVER. I know it doesnt affect that much in your business but I will spread words to every person I know that is trying to bring business with Canadian Tire in the future.
