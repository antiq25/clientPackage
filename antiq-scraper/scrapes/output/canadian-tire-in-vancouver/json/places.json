                "review_text": "It was a great service with Canadian tire center! We had a nail on one of our rear tire. We went to costco, bigotire and Mr. lube to get opinions. We were told that we had to replace all 4 tires without even checking. But we just replace a brand new front tire a year ago and only drove less than 3000 Km since. Costco was the worst of all! They were so impatience and told us they had to replace all four tires because they had to be the same brands because they did not carry my tires brand. Their attitude was the worst!  Canadian tire was our last store to get opinion on.  Gensis, Nash and Steven were very helpful and Gensis was very patience with us. He explained a lot of things to us and help us understand the situation. After listening to our story, Gensis told us that they would first check if our tire was repairable then offered options if it was not.  Both Costco and Mr. Lube never even bothered to do what Canadian tire did. They just assumed that we had a nail and all our four tires were needed to be replaced. Gensis at Canadian tire is such a nice guy and a great supervisor/manager I assumed. He went an extra mile for the customer and put our best interest first! As a business owner myself, I really think it is hard to find a great employee like Gensis these days.  In the end, it turned out to be that our tire only needed a patch. It only cost us 70 dollar! At Costco, they quoted us for almost $3000 to replace all tires. We will for sure go back to Canadian for future replacement!  We would 100% recommend this Canadian tire center at Cambie.",

While the service department was already closed, Booth stopped what he was doing to immediately make sure the store would have my contact info and licence plate number. He took down all my details and told me to call him if I needed anything at all.  As someone who worked for two separate Canadian tires for about 3 years, Booth I appreciate you. Customer coming in frantically 30 mins before close? Likely underpaid/undervalued, and definitely overworked? Its tough, Ive been there but man did you make an already annoying situation for me just a little bit better. Thank you sir!",

This location was very busy because of the Christmas rush and they had loads of easy to find staff that knew where things were. Saved me lots of time and saved my Xmas since they were the only place in town that still had real cut Christmas trees available. They were blowing them out by the time I got there so I got a beautiful $99 tree for $30. The universe loves me :) The Canadian Tire money promos also save me lots of money. I like that I get points at Sportchek and Atmosphere that I can spend here. Excellent value. Ill be back",

During one of my visits I was doing a self check out and to my surprise one of the staff created a handle for my bag because I had an awkward and oversized item. It was so thoughtful. A positive customer experience can make or break a shopping trip and I go out of my way to shop here because of the phenomenal service.

I had quite the experience here over the past month, which started from me trying to simply get my seasonal tire change done. A lot went wrong, but, each time, the service advisors were extremely helpful in explaining why and how, and doing their best to make it right. Which they did. Due strictly to their fantastic service (specifically, Laura and Daniel, A+), this shop gets a no-questions 5/5. Good customer service is the single most important aspect of a successful business, in my opinion, and here it was knocked out of the park. If things go wrong and time is lost to visits where nothing gets done, a good service advisor can make all the difference. When the job finally got done, it got done right, so no issues there. It ended up with me buying a new set of tires and the aligning/balancing that goes with that. The tires are on, the wheels are aligned and balanced, and nothing feels off.",

I usually like to look over the discount plant shelf to see if theres anything there that Im care to try to rescue. I ended up picking up two plants (one 5 cm & 10 cm) n the bigger one was almost dried out. I decided to dunk it in a large container nearby that was filled with water n it had a watering can. After I was done n was trying to get out of the closely packed area, a staff member noticed that I picked up some discount plants n complimented me on trying to rescue some of them. After a short conversation, she ended up offering me two of the small 5 cm plants for free as her Xmas gift to me as it was clear that it easily made me happy. Her name was Pat n she said that why not make someone happy if its easy for her to do so n wished me Merry Xmas. I was very pleased with her kindness and wished her the same. TYVM again Pat giving me such a great experience. One more thing, I dont really enjoy being made to use the self check out machines n sincerely wish that theres an option to purchase products from a humin cashier. So many issues come up with using these machines and I dont enjoy the experience. Thats it. Thanks again, Pat!!",

Reviews on Canadian Tire app says its pretty good compared to more expensive ones including the plastic options. The Canadian Tire employees were very helpful too. I asked three employees for directions since its my first time in this branch and I was wheeling a very cranky taby (toddler baby). If you want to the garden centre, the entrance is the one adjacent to Cambie, not the Cambie one. I repeat not the entrance on Cambie street. Its especially helpful to know this when you also have a stroller or on a wheelchair and going up to  the garden centre. I wanted to buy other things such as veggie seedlings on sale but it was almost impossible with a wailing kid in tow.",

Though she didnt laugh at me (thank you), she did give me a ton of - easy to understand - info on drills, and even took the time to go over pricing with me, even after I said I wasnt going to buy today. You folks have a blazing gold star with this associate, please give her all the kudos/stars/BONUSES/prize. Maggie is the reason I will get this item from Canadian Tire (instead of Amazon or Wal-Mart). Thanks again!!!",

I go to the aisle and am wondering about something, and there is a staff member who explained everything I needed to know. I have my purchases, and go to check-out. I tell a young man I need help because of my damaged gift card. He says I will help you. He is fun and friendly, and BOOM everything is taken care of.

My guess is that she must run that section, as she has an absolutely amazing knowledge of plants. Aside from being so knowledgeable she is also extremely friendly and professional. The plant selection here is one of the best if not the best in the city. You can find all kinds of exotic (healthy) plants here that you will have a difficult time finding somewhere else. Also all of your questions will be answered :)",

He helped me carry the product to my car, found an empty counter for me to finish the payment quickly, gave tips on how to use the product correctly and was very friendly and helpful despite being extremely busy. I just had one part of the entire purchase that was a bit weird. The product is working fine but the no return/refund policy was weird. I initially thought that it would just be on this brand but when I checked, it was present for all AC products, it was not brand specific. I am not sure of the reason of this policy but that was the case when I visited this outlet. I do believe that any issues we can address with the brand itself.",

HOWEVER Bonnie and the store manager (I presume) were super nice and accommodating and allowed me store credit that I promptly used right back into the store. THANK YOU for turning this situation around making an initially not great experience into one of exceeding my customer expectations.

I use to go to the market crossing one but due to their being more of a firearms and hunting section at bentall location I started going here. First off joe from the hunting sectional is a phenomenal character and well versed and knowledgeable on almost all firearms and  goods!  His passionate level of service has kept me coming back to browse and shop there for the past year! The sporting good section has an amazing selection and mostly well stocked in what ever you need! He helped me pick out a required firearm and even introduced me to local areas and groups. My second Major deciding factor or point is the Automotive service section.  I had the fortunate luck to notice a problem before a long trip at this location and after being looked at by a third party in the parking lot I rushed into Canadian tire to see if it was service able that weekend! That s where I talked to bill! If you have a chance I highly recommend talking through bill, he was so calm and intelligent on the matters. even while waiting in line to talk to him he was able to deal with and successfully handle a very insistent customer. Never even breaking his calm and collected demeanour! I highly recommend this store and their personal!",

She was super helpful! Then later on, unfortunately when my partner was looking for something else, he couldnt find anyone and so poked his head into the back where two employees were talking and laughing. I guess this annoyed the one male employee, who was then quite rude to my partner as he was asking questions. Even yelled from the back no goodbye or thank you? when my partner closed the door. He also didnt help show us where we needed to look for a particular item. Luckily the day was saved again my Mei Lin because she happened to be walking by and helped us with a few options and showed us exactly where we could go. Thanks Mei Lin :)",

As my family was preparing to leave for a camping trip early the next morning, we discovered our roof box was broken beyond repair, and since we don t camp light, getting a replacement was crucial. Canadian Tire s website showed a few models in stock, so a friend and I went down to check them out and buy one. It was about an hour before store closing, and I was feeling a bit stressed to be having to buy something without knowing much about the different brands and options. The automotive manager, Kyle, was happy to help, knew the products well, and had lots of good advice on things I wouldn t have thought to consider had he not suggested them. He even helped us get the roofbox installed on my car, and was cheerful and chill the whole time. I left the store confident with the purchase I had made and was so impressed by the quality of customer service.",

                "review_text": "Amazing customer service over the phone with Ward! I called in ahead of time to make sure they had an item because I had a terrible experience at another Canadian Tire location. You could hear that it was busy but Ward went out of his way to provide exceptional customer service. He asked for the item number and had support to make sure the item was available. He confirmed it was and told me what aisle it was in and the location where it would be in the aisle. I walked in, purchased the item and walked out within 5 minutes. My background to the whole experience below. I wanted to pick up Settlers of Catan and saw there were 7 available at the Cambie & 7th location. I went to the location and it took forever to find someone for support. When I did find someone, they told me it wasn t their department and to find the other rep. I found the other rep and had to chase after him as it felt like he was trying to avoid helping clients. Odd when you are hired to help clients. When I asked him about it he said if they are not on the shelf then it s going to be in a box somewhere as they are redoing their toy section. There were a bunch of boxes around the area but he was not even willing to walk over and look on the shelves or even offer to look into a couple of the boxes of items. He just said he can t help and smirked. I am purchasing this item as a family member of a friend of mine is battling cancer. This was a gift to bring their family together through the battle as I heard it s getting tougher at the moment. I was so angry that no one was willing to help. They were clearly unorganized and understaffed.",

Wow! I also purchased a magic bullet brand personal blender on sale for $29.95. This place is a wonderful store for incredible buys. I come often to purchase specials from their flyers when there are things we need. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable. They publish and distribute a flyer every week or every other week depending on the season. This place is advertised as an automotive store but it has so much more to offer with a great selection of housewares, sporting goods and making your home beautiful. Well worth a visit.",

The other CTs don t really do this so this one was great for that. One thing though is this one doesn t have any self checkout stations and there was a huge lineup and only one person jumped on to another cashier to help the one cashier for the longest time.

I was so lucky to get Connors service. He asked a couple of questions to make sure I did need to change the battery. He even took his time to test the battery for me. When I decided to change the battery, he recommended the reasonable one for me. He also offered me two options to replace it: let their machinists do that for me (charge 68$) or by myself. In order to save the money, I chose to do that by myself.  I asked Connor to lent me the tools and tried it. Unfortunately, it was not as simple as I thought and gave it up, and I turned to the machinists for help, but none of them were available at that moment and asked me to leave my car there and they might replace it tomorrow. I was so disappointed and turned to Connor for help again. By the rule, Connor is not allowed to replace the battery for me, but he still be so nice to stand beside and guide me how to do that properly. With his instructions, I finally replace my battery. To be honest, I bothered Connor so many times today, but he was so patient and offered me the best service all the time! Connor, thank you so much for saving my day!",

Joe and the Asian Mechanic with the blonde highlights (Sorry I didnt catch his name) was amazing.  Thank you once again :)",

Now i have seen alot of repairs on my own vehicles over the years and spentalot of time wrenching my trucks in the parking lot just like my dad would do . And my favorite part as a kid was getting to keep the canadian tire money. Over the years its been growing into a great all round needs kinda store there house brand is become very compeditive with the big name power tools and at a price way below which is a good thing for the low budget people or if you are just a tight wad like my self . They have a great spray paint selection for those small paint jobs or brush on or larger sprayer paints as well as all your paint accessories.  The auto motive section is large and user friendly lay out for the self serve types or if you need help well good luck on fast service and when you get it its rare to find an employee wllling to solve your needs if they dont have what you need .that being said  i think over all this world would not be the same without canadian tire . Im glad its there for my needs . I highly recomend this store for someone who has not already experianced the good this store has .",

This is a brilliant opportunity to find great deals on clearance sales as the store shifts its shelves they have lowered prices on items that have not been selling or the remainder of seasonal products. This is a wonderful store with great staff members who greet you when you arrive, help you find whatever you need while you are there and assist you when you are leaving. There are a couple of really amazing managers who treat the customers well and the staff seem content which probably means they are given the respect they deserve. All in all Canadian Tire is my favorite store and it is amazing that this fanchise has given their customers rewards since the begining. Canadian Tire money is the first reward system and that has changed our retail experience because now all stores have reward programs. This is a great sorce of pride for this corporation and a part of our culture which protrays a national identity which we all can be excited to be a part of. Support this store and you will not be dissapointed but rather fulfilled with quality and reasonably priced products.",

I spoke with Hammad, and he was so helpful and very polite, explaining all he was going to do; then put me on hold momentarily to locate the kettle.  When he returned, he informed me that he did put the kettle on hold, and I went that same evening to pick it up.  I was so grateful for all of his help, and Hammad has proven to be such a good Customer Service Associate.  Thank you Hammad!",

This year I got the Canadian Tire VIP card which was a fantastic deal. I feel bad when the survey asked if anyone made my visit special because I don t need anyone now. I walk through the doors, pull up my C.T. App and search for what I am looking for. Batteries (Isle 13), electrical Isle 56. And, more importantly they are right where the app says and always in stock. Take note Rona get organized or you will be out of business soon as you are hopeless at stock control and customer service.",

I wish that they had a better indoor plant selection and outdoor seasonal garden centre. There is a huge opportunity for this location, as competitors nearby don t have great stock or service. If I need a plant, I ll usually drive to Bentall, which has an amazing selection, but it s much further away.",

This evening I went to this location looking for several items, including a large ladder twice my size, with very limited time. Firstly, the website is amazing and helpful - it says locations where items are available, the quantity, and even the aisle. That is seriously awesome for somebody like myself that loves to do research but prefers to shop in-store. Secondly, every staff member I spoke to and asked for help answered my questions, directed me to where I needed to go, and offered to help carry my things aisle to aisle then to the cash register then to my car. I am blown away. I cannot thank you all enough.",

Like all Canadian tires, the shop sells various tools, machines, and everything you will need for your household, outdoor needs, DIY projects, toys, scooter, skateboard, bike and bike accessories, of course, it includes a car repair factory. Overall, most Canadian tires will have everything of what you need. Well, transportation is also convenient, such as buses and skytrains and many shops are around this store. I will recommend this store.",

I m changing this to 5 stars because the Cambie Canadian tire handled orders online much better when there s ambiguity for  in stock  products, and actually following up with the order online _______ From my previous experience How is it that a company this big doesnt know how many items theyre receiving in stock, and then arbitrarily put some number online. Wasted my time. Also many of the menu options on phone didnt even work, had to go in person to find out and be disappointed.",

I asked where I could find a certain item and  the Canadian Tire staff member led me to the isle and the item. That was definitely a time saver. When i saw the price listed i was not so sure i wanted to spend quite that much money on it and I said that to the him. He said let me do a price check on the item and he said i was in luck. He had located the item advertized in a competitors store and he offered a Price Match.  I was pleasantly surprised and bought the item. Its part of their gaurantee. There is lots of parking there and the store is always stocked up with everything you could want and they bring in lots of items to match the current season as well. They also have mechanics ready to do repairs or install new tires and batteries headlights and more.Please Like to show me I am making a difference. Thx",

It was Stanley that helped me out to find the right ones, in addition, he also helped me to find the parts for Volvo coolant recovery cap which I will replace it next time when I visit Canadian Tire Store. I have been happily served by Stanley when he was with the Store located in Coppersmith Shopping Centre in Steveston  Hwy for last couple of years. I didnt know that he has moved to No. 3 Road Store until accidentally found him there. I will come for my future car services there as long as Stanley is there. He is so helpful and a great customer services person.",

I called in before bringing in my car(flat tire) and was told by the representative that they have the exact same tire on location and provided me the latest time/day it will be finished. That day came and when I called to check if my car is ready, turned out they do not have the tire and will have to be ordered and shipped from a different location. At this point, I was given another day/time when it will be completed. I received a call saying my car is finished, I came back and the car is not ready nor is the tire even on location. No one seems to be taking ownership of the 2 mistakes with the exception of Genesis. He took ownership of the issue and provided me with creative solutions to have the car ready at the time I needed it by. He was able to have my car ready within a very short time frame. We (consumers) need more reps like Genesis. Service: Tires",

But the thing that put this shop over the top was when they did with my car when it was ready for pick up. See the photo. I mean how incredibly thoughtful...

                "review_text": "Hello I d like to express the greatest gratitude to Johnny Ray Ritchie and his team of specialists for having brought my vehicle back to running condition and returned it to my property over the weekend.  The team was knowledgeable, transparent, and went the extra mile to order the necessary parts from out of country or did the repair if possible when parts are no longer available.  Despite me being only in town only during the month of Aug I was kept updated via email every step along the way and work continued long after I left for another 2 months. The vehicle involved is a 91 deVille which had sat idled for around 5 years with numerous issues.  It had a decomposed flat tire, dead battery, engine wouldn t start even when jumped, and inoperative windows.  It was towed in with an objective of bringing it back to road running condition. After initial diagnostic it was discovered the fuel tank was cracked and the fuel pump was non functional.  I was advised up front the potential of finding additional faults so the hidden costs may exceed the vehicle s worth such that I was able to make an informed decision and set the correct expectations. Since then the team went on to identify additional faults.  The AC compressor and power steering fluid line were replaced.  For the pulley system it was initially suspected that both the AC compressor and water pump pulleys were faulty.  I was expecting both to be replaced but the team took the extra time to confirm only the AC compressor pulley needed work.  For the windows switches, they investigated both buying original parts removed from other vehicles vs disassembling the mechanical switches to try repairing themselves.  They decided to try the latter to save costs for the parts. Worth mentioning is a vehicle like this wouldn t have been able to be serviced if it was brought into the dealership.  Not knowing when I d be back in the country next a scheduled reminder have been put on my profile so a quote will be sent to me a year from now for the vehicle to be towed back in for its next annual maintenance. As a customer I was not only impressed with the team doing what they needed to do to get the vehicle repaired given the scarcity of parts, I was also extremely pleased with the way Johnny managed it, and did what he could to keep the costs down.

As you mentioned, my team is in fact trained to recommend inspections and diagnostics be performed to isolate most of our customers concerns. This is to ensure the repairs are guaranteed, instead of wasting money on repairs that arent needed. It can definitely get expensive if you have multiple concerns, but we do our absolute best to keep things affordable for our customers. We have heard way too many horror stories of technicians replacing parts based on codes or uneducated guesses, and simply do not want to fall into that category. Standing behind our work is important to us, and we cannot do that if we dont encourage due diligence from the start. We appreciate both your feedback and business!

We have never claimed to be open until 10pm.  We have experienced issues with Google changing our hours in the past, so I apologize if this has caused you any inconvenience. I hope you understand and give us a chance to turn this into a positive experience/review. *Update* Thank you very much for your understanding.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS STORE. This store do not even deserve 1 star after having that conversation with that horrible human being. I am about to purchase over a thousand dollar set of tires online for my vehicle and called the AUTOMOTIVE service and see how much would they charge for tire change. Whoever answer that call from AUTOMOTIVE department must be fired if Canadian Tire DONT wanna lose future loyal customers. I can guarantee that HE do not care about Canadian Tire as a company as he do not care about me trying to spend over a thousand dollars for this store. I am just trying to ask some legitimate questions and just want 30 seconds of his time but he chose to hang up on me for he said he is busy. I was even polite to ask him to please bear with me as I am looking for the correct information of my car to avoid confusion but he instead just hang up like a CHILD who has TEMPER TANTRUMS. If He don t care about me who is about to spend over a thousand dollars to  bring business to the company in exchange for 30 seconds of his paid time by the Canadian Tire, I m wondering how he treat those customers who spend less than that. To the extremely RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL person who answered my call, my TIME is as precious as your time SIR! If you do not wish to answer legitimate questions from customers then clearly youre in the wrong business and if you hate getting calls then QUIT YOUR JOB to spare Canadian Tire an embarrassment and losing business for having YOU. You are dragging down some good employee from this store and that how selfish of you. Mopping floor as a job do not require answering calls from customers just to give you an idea. Im wondering how the elders are treated when they call this store and you happen to be on the other line. To the executive officers and Shareholders of Canadian Tire who are reading this,  youre setting your bar really really low for having this horrible PERSON representing your company. I am a loyal Canadian Tire customer and now I will also cancel my triangle Mastercard. I will promise not to bring business to this company EVER. I know it doesnt affect that much in your business but I will spread words to every person I know that is trying to bring business with Canadian Tire in the future. I already filed a complaint at the head office and Im hoping its not too late for the company to address this issue before losing another loyal customers.",
