Rooms are simple (for instance, the living room was pretty bare) but are well maintained and cleaned daily. I stayed in a suite at a high floor. It offered an unblocked view of the Vancouver suburbs, with minimal tall buildings blocking the view. Safety: Surrounding neighbourhood is safe. Walkability: Crystal Mall has a lot of Asian (specifically Chinese) shops and eateries. Metropolis at Metrotown is within walking distance and offers a huge selection of shopping (e.g. Walmart and Canadian Superstore). Food & drinks: Breakfast buffet service is available for a fee and the spread is decent, certainly on par with Hilton breakfasts.",a week ago,2023-11-18 05:07:27.159358,,,,0,13,2,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115148183661617966575/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

The room was a bit dusty, but that is completely okay as we did not need to reach those areas.

However, it was a false alarmed fire evacuation that we have to give less stars due to the hotels lack of leadership and direction in helping guests to evacuate safely.

And the Vancouver metro system is a very good way to get around for my needs. Although I have to say the car park was a bit confusing at first. Hotel has great rooms. Seems to be new. I liked the room facilities. Everything was great. Breakfast was nice. Service was good but can be iffy when it is super busy. One day I had to wait for coffee for a long time. Would be better if there is self service. The staff are running up and down as it was super busy.

My family and I have been staying at the Hilton metro town loyally since 2013. I started school at BCIT nearby. In that time we have gotten to know Stephanie and she is such a wonderful person. My father has stayed here as well on business other times and he always raves about the service and friendliness of everyone. Now it is February 2021 We arrived and needed a room. I can t remember her name (it started with a A). But she checked us in very quickly and efficiently. We were also given a room higher up with a view which was amazing. I asked for Stephanie and was told she was working tomorrow. The next morning we were delighted to have a COVID free breakfast and coffees. Thank you so much. Our purpose for this hotel stay was to purchase a vehicle. So that day we went out and bought a   SUV. As we were from out of town, we stayed another night. I got to talk to Stephanie that afternoon which was so nice, and we were given parking additionally for our new SUV which was great. What happened next was incredible.. We had bought a new set of winter tires and rims which were currently sitting inside our new vehicle in the underground parking. At about 10pm our phone in our hotel room rang and it was security. They were concerned for our new SUV and tires and they offered the loading locked garage to park it in for the night. I was happy to hear that they were watching out for us and so I went downstairs and moved our suv. This is something that was above and beyond what we asked for and it was incredible. Also to note that our room was extremely clean and we felt safe during our stay during this pandemic. That was very important to us. I can t rave enough about the Hilton metro town and thank you again for a wonderful stay.

I was happy to find a hotel close, but far enough from my home in the suburbs that accommodates larger breed dogs. The location of the hotel was great because Central park was right there to take my little guy out for some exercise each morning, the Metrotown shopping centre was easily accessible as it is literally right across the street, and even though I stuck with the hotels room service menu there are plenty of quality restaurant nearby to indulge in. I was alittle disappointed I didnt get to stay in the room I originally paid for, which was a king bed with a view on one of the top floors, but was super grateful when they upgraded me to a suite on one of the lower pet-friendly floors.

Whether it was offering directions or much needed forgotten toiletries they were always there with a friendly smile and expedient service. The Lobby gives an excellent preview of the decor, which is eclectic and lots of fun. Very untraditional and thats what made it so enjoyable. The  hotel house party idea first through us off, we are not party types and were concerned of the noise. We stayed on the 2nd floor and did not hear any noise during our stay related to the party. Frankly, if there was a party happening we were unaware. Thats how quiet it was. The living room is a fun place to have drinks and get some food. Decorated with some goofiness In mind its a very inviting space. Plenty to see and the food was delicious. The room itself was delightful, the design motif from the rest of the hotel continues into these rooms.  The no diving shower was a fun addition. Since no place is truly perfect I need to find something to put into a negative. That would be room size, we stayed in a double twin bed room and found it to be on the small side.

Everything is so walkable that you dont even need to take a taxi/Uber, the amount of time & money you are saving. Before I stayed at this hotel, I was skeptical since so many Google reviews mentioned how noisy the streets and the areas are that they couldnt sleep. Occasionally, there are noise from outside but they are manageable and within reason. I was ok with it and had good sleeps. Listen, lets be rational and be reasonable here, you are staying in the entertainment/clubbing district, and you are complaining about excessive noise? You must be kidding me here. Name me a place around the world where you stay close to bars and clubs and you expect to hear nothing but crickets? I am just being realistic and being reasonable here.

The location cannot be beat. Parking is perfect alongside the building, cheap for this city at $14/night, and self-park in/out. The room was clean, simple, and small, but it had comfortable beds and a nice view of the city by night. We needed a place for a hot shower, a good nights sleep, and a chance to catch the evening news. Breakfast is free through the hotels pub and is filling and complete. I had seen many reviews about small rooms, loudness, or bed bugs, and decided to take a gamble. I found all of that to be unfounded with the exception of the rooms being small. If you are really going on vacation to see the city though, they have plenty of space to set down a suitcase, write a letter/postcard at your desk and store souvenirs.

Pretty much right in the heart of downtown, can easily get to anywhere in Vancouver fairly quickly by either walking or catching a bus/skytrain. I don t drive and so I spent most of my time walking around, finding new places to eat, and hanging out in the nearby parks/waterfronts. Overall, was a really enjoyable experience!

I travel weekly for Business, for the next 3 months I am in Vancouver visiting different clients within BC. I am an IHG member and have stayed in almost every property in BC. That being said, I had a great experiences at every location, but I had a superb experience at the Metro-town location. I arrived in the afternoon cranky, Lisa at the front desk didnt break a sweat, even with the pending 3rd party approval she promptly got me into a room. Upon opening the door to my room, I was greeted with the lingering stench of a smoker. A quick phone to the front desk and I found myself upgraded to the only available room left, the Executive Level. Needless to say, I was more than obliged. The hotel offers all the same amenities of Holiday Inn Suburbia Express at a convenient downtown location. The hotel is practically adjacent to the Metrotown Center and offers free valet parking, high speed internet access, and complimentary breakfast. That being said, there are a few areas of improvement: - Executive rooms should have wireless routers in the room, moving past the bed became an internet dead zone for wireless access. - The Danby refrigerators are loud: I wasnt sure if mine was on the way out, but I have noticed this problem in many other Holiday Inns as well. - Not a fan of the food choices for the continental breakfast, not a fan of free processed breakfast in general. - This is 2013, would it hurt to modernize the business areas or bedside tables with USB ports or radios to plug our USB smart phones into? I typically find most plugs are eaten up by Clunky hotel fixtures and why are desks so high but the Task chairs are like reverse booster chairs? (Also a problem in most hotels) All in all, I was very happy with this location and I am planning on staying here again this weekend and possibly next week as well.",10 years ago,2013-11-25 05:07:42.718891,,,,0,3,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104934908205538338487/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,
