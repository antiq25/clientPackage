                "review_text": "It was a great service with Canadian tire center! We had a nail on one of our rear tire. We went to costco, bigotire and Mr. lube to get opinions. We were told that we had to replace all 4 tires without even checking. But we just replace a brand new front tire a year ago and only drove less than 3000 Km since. Costco was the worst of all! They were so impatience and told us they had to replace all four tires because they had to be the same brands because they did not carry my tires brand. Their attitude was the worst!  Canadian tire was our last store to get opinion on.  Gensis, Nash and Steven were very helpful and Gensis was very patience with us. He explained a lot of things to us and help us understand the situation. After listening to our story, Gensis told us that they would first check if our tire was repairable then offered options if it was not.  Both Costco and Mr. Lube never even bothered to do what Canadian tire did. They just assumed that we had a nail and all our four tires were needed to be replaced. Gensis at Canadian tire is such a nice guy and a great supervisor/manager I assumed. He went an extra mile for the customer and put our best interest first! As a business owner myself, I really think it is hard to find a great employee like Gensis these days.  In the end, it turned out to be that our tire only needed a patch. It only cost us 70 dollar! At Costco, they quoted us for almost $3000 to replace all tires. We will for sure go back to Canadian for future replacement!  We would 100% recommend this Canadian tire center at Cambie.",

While the service department was already closed, Booth stopped what he was doing to immediately make sure the store would have my contact info and licence plate number. He took down all my details and told me to call him if I needed anything at all.  As someone who worked for two separate Canadian tires for about 3 years, Booth I appreciate you. Customer coming in frantically 30 mins before close? Likely underpaid/undervalued, and definitely overworked? Its tough, Ive been there but man did you make an already annoying situation for me just a little bit better. Thank you sir!",

This location was very busy because of the Christmas rush and they had loads of easy to find staff that knew where things were. Saved me lots of time and saved my Xmas since they were the only place in town that still had real cut Christmas trees available. They were blowing them out by the time I got there so I got a beautiful $99 tree for $30. The universe loves me :) The Canadian Tire money promos also save me lots of money. I like that I get points at Sportchek and Atmosphere that I can spend here. Excellent value. Ill be back",

During one of my visits I was doing a self check out and to my surprise one of the staff created a handle for my bag because I had an awkward and oversized item. It was so thoughtful. A positive customer experience can make or break a shopping trip and I go out of my way to shop here because of the phenomenal service.

I had quite the experience here over the past month, which started from me trying to simply get my seasonal tire change done. A lot went wrong, but, each time, the service advisors were extremely helpful in explaining why and how, and doing their best to make it right. Which they did. Due strictly to their fantastic service (specifically, Laura and Daniel, A+), this shop gets a no-questions 5/5. Good customer service is the single most important aspect of a successful business, in my opinion, and here it was knocked out of the park. If things go wrong and time is lost to visits where nothing gets done, a good service advisor can make all the difference. When the job finally got done, it got done right, so no issues there. It ended up with me buying a new set of tires and the aligning/balancing that goes with that. The tires are on, the wheels are aligned and balanced, and nothing feels off.",

I usually like to look over the discount plant shelf to see if theres anything there that Im care to try to rescue. I ended up picking up two plants (one 5 cm & 10 cm) n the bigger one was almost dried out. I decided to dunk it in a large container nearby that was filled with water n it had a watering can. After I was done n was trying to get out of the closely packed area, a staff member noticed that I picked up some discount plants n complimented me on trying to rescue some of them. After a short conversation, she ended up offering me two of the small 5 cm plants for free as her Xmas gift to me as it was clear that it easily made me happy. Her name was Pat n she said that why not make someone happy if its easy for her to do so n wished me Merry Xmas. I was very pleased with her kindness and wished her the same. TYVM again Pat giving me such a great experience. One more thing, I dont really enjoy being made to use the self check out machines n sincerely wish that theres an option to purchase products from a humin cashier. So many issues come up with using these machines and I dont enjoy the experience. Thats it. Thanks again, Pat!!",

Reviews on Canadian Tire app says its pretty good compared to more expensive ones including the plastic options. The Canadian Tire employees were very helpful too. I asked three employees for directions since its my first time in this branch and I was wheeling a very cranky taby (toddler baby). If you want to the garden centre, the entrance is the one adjacent to Cambie, not the Cambie one. I repeat not the entrance on Cambie street. Its especially helpful to know this when you also have a stroller or on a wheelchair and going up to  the garden centre. I wanted to buy other things such as veggie seedlings on sale but it was almost impossible with a wailing kid in tow.",

Though she didnt laugh at me (thank you), she did give me a ton of - easy to understand - info on drills, and even took the time to go over pricing with me, even after I said I wasnt going to buy today. You folks have a blazing gold star with this associate, please give her all the kudos/stars/BONUSES/prize. Maggie is the reason I will get this item from Canadian Tire (instead of Amazon or Wal-Mart). Thanks again!!!",

I go to the aisle and am wondering about something, and there is a staff member who explained everything I needed to know. I have my purchases, and go to check-out. I tell a young man I need help because of my damaged gift card. He says I will help you. He is fun and friendly, and BOOM everything is taken care of.

My guess is that she must run that section, as she has an absolutely amazing knowledge of plants. Aside from being so knowledgeable she is also extremely friendly and professional. The plant selection here is one of the best if not the best in the city. You can find all kinds of exotic (healthy) plants here that you will have a difficult time finding somewhere else. Also all of your questions will be answered :)",

He helped me carry the product to my car, found an empty counter for me to finish the payment quickly, gave tips on how to use the product correctly and was very friendly and helpful despite being extremely busy. I just had one part of the entire purchase that was a bit weird. The product is working fine but the no return/refund policy was weird. I initially thought that it would just be on this brand but when I checked, it was present for all AC products, it was not brand specific. I am not sure of the reason of this policy but that was the case when I visited this outlet. I do believe that any issues we can address with the brand itself.",

HOWEVER Bonnie and the store manager (I presume) were super nice and accommodating and allowed me store credit that I promptly used right back into the store. THANK YOU for turning this situation around making an initially not great experience into one of exceeding my customer expectations.

I use to go to the market crossing one but due to their being more of a firearms and hunting section at bentall location I started going here. First off joe from the hunting sectional is a phenomenal character and well versed and knowledgeable on almost all firearms and  goods!  His passionate level of service has kept me coming back to browse and shop there for the past year! The sporting good section has an amazing selection and mostly well stocked in what ever you need! He helped me pick out a required firearm and even introduced me to local areas and groups. My second Major deciding factor or point is the Automotive service section.  I had the fortunate luck to notice a problem before a long trip at this location and after being looked at by a third party in the parking lot I rushed into Canadian tire to see if it was service able that weekend! That s where I talked to bill! If you have a chance I highly recommend talking through bill, he was so calm and intelligent on the matters. even while waiting in line to talk to him he was able to deal with and successfully handle a very insistent customer. Never even breaking his calm and collected demeanour! I highly recommend this store and their personal!",

She was super helpful! Then later on, unfortunately when my partner was looking for something else, he couldnt find anyone and so poked his head into the back where two employees were talking and laughing. I guess this annoyed the one male employee, who was then quite rude to my partner as he was asking questions. Even yelled from the back no goodbye or thank you? when my partner closed the door. He also didnt help show us where we needed to look for a particular item. Luckily the day was saved again my Mei Lin because she happened to be walking by and helped us with a few options and showed us exactly where we could go. Thanks Mei Lin :)",

As my family was preparing to leave for a camping trip early the next morning, we discovered our roof box was broken beyond repair, and since we don t camp light, getting a replacement was crucial. Canadian Tire s website showed a few models in stock, so a friend and I went down to check them out and buy one. It was about an hour before store closing, and I was feeling a bit stressed to be having to buy something without knowing much about the different brands and options. The automotive manager, Kyle, was happy to help, knew the products well, and had lots of good advice on things I wouldn t have thought to consider had he not suggested them. He even helped us get the roofbox installed on my car, and was cheerful and chill the whole time. I left the store confident with the purchase I had made and was so impressed by the quality of customer service.",

                "review_text": "Amazing customer service over the phone with Ward! I called in ahead of time to make sure they had an item because I had a terrible experience at another Canadian Tire location. You could hear that it was busy but Ward went out of his way to provide exceptional customer service. He asked for the item number and had support to make sure the item was available. He confirmed it was and told me what aisle it was in and the location where it would be in the aisle. I walked in, purchased the item and walked out within 5 minutes. My background to the whole experience below. I wanted to pick up Settlers of Catan and saw there were 7 available at the Cambie & 7th location. I went to the location and it took forever to find someone for support. When I did find someone, they told me it wasn t their department and to find the other rep. I found the other rep and had to chase after him as it felt like he was trying to avoid helping clients. Odd when you are hired to help clients. When I asked him about it he said if they are not on the shelf then it s going to be in a box somewhere as they are redoing their toy section. There were a bunch of boxes around the area but he was not even willing to walk over and look on the shelves or even offer to look into a couple of the boxes of items. He just said he can t help and smirked. I am purchasing this item as a family member of a friend of mine is battling cancer. This was a gift to bring their family together through the battle as I heard it s getting tougher at the moment. I was so angry that no one was willing to help. They were clearly unorganized and understaffed.",

So few days ago I was checking this foldable bucket online and it said there was 3 in stock before I went into the store only to find that there was none on the shelf. I urgently need it so I ask one of the staff there to find out what s wrong, most staff would tell me if you don t see it we don t have it. Until I came to ask this guy Keerith, he put down the task he had at hand and personally went to the back and really made the effort to look for it, and he managed to find the item for me in the deepest corner of the warehouse. This is the kind of customer service we all need, Keerith, you made the store look good! Because of you, my camping trip was complete!",

My plan was to fly into YZR, get the truck and be across the border by nightfall. Loooong story short, its been 5 days and dont know when US BPC and Ram of the US will supply needed paperwork and let me cross to begin my cross country journey. Having to live in the truck since this was unexpected to say the least. I spent 2 days going from WM to WM trying to get supplies needed to stay warm in the truck etc (heater core leaked, had to bypass until I get home to my tools). Turns out Canadian Tire not only had EVEYTHING I needed, they had several options and were only 6 minutes from home base! Besides the people of Canada, Canadian Tire will be the only thing I will miss upon returning home. If youre a man (or woman) this is guy heaven! Everything guys shop for, its here.

We found it odd that they do not have a well marked curbside pickup spot - although the store offers online pickup. Curbside pickup spot might be hidden deep among the parking spots available in front of the store, though.

Their garage service is excellent and I have never had the feeling that they were trying to sell me anything that I didnt need. Im quite knowledgable with cars and would know if they were trying. Usually, they have returned my car without any problems found, which underlines their honesty. The staff and mechanics are friendly and funny. They take their time to explain everything and answer any questions you might have. Only once, my car wasnt locked up when I returned to the parking lot. I asked why and noticed that they had a trainee driving it to the parking lot. I havent seen her since. I usually keep an eye out to see when my car is back on the lot and ready for pick-up, because they do not always call you right away when theyre busy, but the time they tell you it requires to fix your car or do the oil change and inspection is usually correct, so you know when to be back. The one thing I would like to suggest is to always apply the handbrake when taking a customers car back to the lot, because I have never seen anyone do that. All of this being said, I would recommend Canadian Tires garage service at Market Crossing any time due to their honesty.",

I had ordered online twice but it didn t work out so I went all the way to this location on market place and the line up was crazy outside . Once I got in I went straight for the bikes only to be told I had to line up yet again to see the bikes. I finally got to see the bikes but none were what I wanted or had even ordered so I asked the sales girl if there was anymore she said they are being built and hopefully will be put on display and to come back in a bit but i would have to line up again, ugh. I went up to the manager Rod and he said hang tight and brought me out a bike similar to what I wanted I was so happy! The price is was even better then what I was going to originally  pay. I have to give It to Rod he was kind attentive and wonderful! Thank you Rod! Stay safe and thank you for all that you and your staff are doing!",

Terry is an amazing staff member who did so well in managing a huge line up during a crazy weekend, and still provide great attention to detail. He made sure to listen to my concerns, and afterwards explained what the mechanics found under my hood. Surprisingly, he didnt try to upsell me anything. Terry was very honest in making recommendations. Canadian Tire is notorious for having bad service, and Terry is probably the only reason they still have our business. If he hasnt gotten it yet, he deserves a huge raise. Terry, thank you for your service. They need more people like you.",

It turns out that June is a very bad time to be looking for a bicycle and, we needed 2, a mans and a ladys. Shops are sold out all over the lower mainland, even several of the Canadian Tire stores were also low on stock. We found a ladys bike we liked at the store in Burnaby South and drove from North Vancouver to have a look. When we got there we were not able to find it (it turns out that it was there; however, it had a yellow tag on it indicating that it was put on layaway). We were disappointed and were about to settle for something else when we happened upon Rod, the manager. We talked some and eventually got around to the point that we were actually looking for an E-Bike but were having trouble finding one for a reasonable price. Rod said that he has a mans and a ladys E-Bike in stoke and before I could say hold the phone he went to the back to bring  out the ladys version. We talked some more when Rod said Ill see what I can do about the price. My wife and I discussed the merits of purchasing an E-Bike from Canadian Tire when Rod came back and quoted an amount which was 30% less than the ticketed price. Wow, that is a good deal. We will buy both of them! I said. As it turned out, the mans bike had a couple of issues which I noticed later: 1) it didnt have a rear rat trap and 2) the motor would not engage when I peddled. After fiddle farting around with the electronics , I discovered that the crank sensor was mounted on the wrong side of the crank assembly. On the working ladys bike , the sensor was on the left hand side of the crank assembly. On the mens bike , the sensor was on the right side. I decided not to try to fix this and simply return this to another Canadian Tire store which had these bikes in store for an exchange. The South Burnaby store was sold out. Great price and happy ending.",

The absolute erudite grace of this exceptional employee ensured my safe and speedy discovery of the product i was searching helplessly for amid the lengthy aisles of this great establishment. Without the favoured blessing of KAYLA s help, i would have wandered destitute for ages amongst the filthy general public possibly brimming with diseases and perhaps even lice. My concurrence with this delightful, engaging employee should immediately convince anyone of her extensive knowledge and acute sensitivity towards the unfulfilled yearnings of customers, as she approached me when i was at my darkest, most desolate hour with the intentions of bringing me back into the light of intelligence, warmth, and kindness. In the bittersweet end of our charming and polite conversation, she directed me confidently to aisle 27 and i left with my boating paddle- with my soul soaring in a satisfied cloud of euphoria.",

I was not expecting to have such a pleasant experience, but I did, and now I m left with a very positive impression of your business. Employees like this one are a company s  secret weapon .  These days, employers undervalue the impact their front-line employees make on the bottom line. You ll have my repeat business for as long as my experience remains consistently good   so I suggest doing your best to attract and keep more people like Rod Louie And I will definitely spread the word, both verbally and through social media.

I came to see the two household appliances that were advertised and scored excellent buys. Brightly lit aisles and well stocked displays. The microwave oven section was half empty but I managed to find a boxed Cuisinart air fryer convention toaster oven in stock as advertised at 50% off along with an additional $50 discount at the checkout! Wow! I also purchased a magic bullet brand personal blender on sale for $29.95. This place is a wonderful store for incredible buys. I come often to purchase specials from their flyers when there are things we need. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable. They publish and distribute a flyer every week or every other week depending on the season. This place is advertised as an automotive store but it has so much more to offer with a great selection of housewares, sporting goods and making your home beautiful. Well worth a visit.",

The other CTs don t really do this so this one was great for that. One thing though is this one doesn t have any self checkout stations and there was a huge lineup and only one person jumped on to another cashier to help the one cashier for the longest time.

I was so lucky to get Connors service. He asked a couple of questions to make sure I did need to change the battery. He even took his time to test the battery for me. When I decided to change the battery, he recommended the reasonable one for me. He also offered me two options to replace it: let their machinists do that for me (charge 68$) or by myself. In order to save the money, I chose to do that by myself.  I asked Connor to lent me the tools and tried it. Unfortunately, it was not as simple as I thought and gave it up, and I turned to the machinists for help, but none of them were available at that moment and asked me to leave my car there and they might replace it tomorrow. I was so disappointed and turned to Connor for help again. By the rule, Connor is not allowed to replace the battery for me, but he still be so nice to stand beside and guide me how to do that properly. With his instructions, I finally replace my battery. To be honest, I bothered Connor so many times today, but he was so patient and offered me the best service all the time! Connor, thank you so much for saving my day!",

There was a technical issue with the printer and while the credit card company was NOT AT ALL helpful in troubleshooting the issue so that I could get points on that purchase, the in-store staff went above and beyond to help me out. Special thanks to Ranjot Nagra who was patient and competent and made sure that I was happy before I left the store. Could have been a real nightmare and Im still really mad about the credit companys customer service representatives complete lack of customer service, but the Canadian Tire staff at the front desk and in the garden department were really lovely.",

Joe from the Automotive Service Department answered and told me to bring my vehicle in.  He said that it would probably take a few hours because they have quite a few vehicles in for servicing today.  He managed to somehow squeeze me in and had me back on the road in under an hour.  I cant thank Joe enough.  From the turnaround time to the service to the professionalism, I am extremely satisfied.  Joe and the Asian Mechanic with the blonde highlights (Sorry I didnt catch his name) was amazing.  Thank you once again :)",

Now i have seen alot of repairs on my own vehicles over the years and spentalot of time wrenching my trucks in the parking lot just like my dad would do . And my favorite part as a kid was getting to keep the canadian tire money. Over the years its been growing into a great all round needs kinda store there house brand is become very compeditive with the big name power tools and at a price way below which is a good thing for the low budget people or if you are just a tight wad like my self . They have a great spray paint selection for those small paint jobs or brush on or larger sprayer paints as well as all your paint accessories.  The auto motive section is large and user friendly lay out for the self serve types or if you need help well good luck on fast service and when you get it its rare to find an employee wllling to solve your needs if they dont have what you need .that being said  i think over all this world would not be the same without canadian tire . Im glad its there for my needs . I highly recomend this store for someone who has not already experianced the good this store has .",

This is a brilliant opportunity to find great deals on clearance sales as the store shifts its shelves they have lowered prices on items that have not been selling or the remainder of seasonal products. This is a wonderful store with great staff members who greet you when you arrive, help you find whatever you need while you are there and assist you when you are leaving. There are a couple of really amazing managers who treat the customers well and the staff seem content which probably means they are given the respect they deserve. All in all Canadian Tire is my favorite store and it is amazing that this fanchise has given their customers rewards since the begining. Canadian Tire money is the first reward system and that has changed our retail experience because now all stores have reward programs. This is a great sorce of pride for this corporation and a part of our culture which protrays a national identity which we all can be excited to be a part of. Support this store and you will not be dissapointed but rather fulfilled with quality and reasonably priced products.",

We waited for about 25 mins but it was so worth it. The food was delicious, the service was amazing and the vibe was fun. We had a few of the specials: jellyfish on tofu, miso black cod (SO GOOD), udon shrimp carbonara and from the regular menu the sashimi salad and karaage. The only thing I d say is there was a bit too much dressing for our taste on the salad but honestly everything aaa so good. The waitress was attentive and kind. We finished off with a panna cotta with blueberry coulis. Highly recommend!",

The atmosphere energetic and playful. The food was prepared quickly and was delicious, flavorful, and presented in a beautiful manner. We got the special 3/$14 tofu appetizer, shishito peppers, and the fish cake tempura. Shrimp black fried rice, okonomiyaki,  and the nametake meguro. It was all so delicious and a bit more than we could eat, but happy to take the leftovers home. The staff kept us smiling thought the meal and the chefs were fun to watch in action!

We had the Beef Tataki, Beef Hanger steak with Chives, Ebi Mayo, Bean sprout gomaae, Salmon belly and Deep fried oysters. No complaints! Very satisfying dishes.",

I ve been to Guu locations for several years now, with Thurlow being my favorite; what makes this time special was trying two new specials that I just HAD to write a review for. Let s start off with overall ambience and experience. As always, walking into a Guu will give you the feeling of entering a izakaya in Japan. An exposed, homey, and intimate setting. Service is excellent as always with friendly front of house staff and knowledgeable bussing team along with energetic kitchen staff. Now let s move onto food, we had the assorted oden, Yaki udon, pork liver, and spicy salmon belly - the last two being the specials. They highlighted the entire meal and both were so tender and incredibly flavourful: the pork was paired with vegetables and was overall savoury whereas the salmon was crispy, sweet and spicy. Spectacular restaurant.",

We looked for a restaurant close to our hotel, and we picked Guu Original as it was walking distance. What a great vibe. The atmosphere was very welcoming and friendly. The servers were all so polite and served us with a smile. The food came quickly. We had 3 appetizers for $14. We ordered the Smoked Sausage with Carrot Sauce, Grilled Capelin and Fish Cake Tempura. They all definitely paired well with the Japanese IPA that I tried. It was very refreshing. For our mains, we ordered the the Assorted Sashimi on Sushi Rice and the Grilled Pork Belly. They were all so fresh and delicious. The pork belly had no gaminess at all. Ill definitely go back to try the rest of the menu. My son really enjoyed his first Izakaya experience.",

                "review_text": "Wow, just wow. This place looks just like any other regular izakaya but dont let that fool you. Food here is top notch, and so are the staff. Id say that everyone was very friendly, energetic and inviting. We ordered from the regular menu and the daily special menu. From the special menu we got the aburi salmon on rice and the BBQ eel rice. The rest of the dishes were from the regular menu. These include: smoked monkfish liver, Takowasabi, karaage, takoyaki, and ikamaru (grilled squid). For dessert we ordered the mochi ice cream. The aburi salmon was fantastic. It was plated beautifully. The salmon looked overdone but in fact, it was lightly torched. This in combination with the vinegary sushi rice was delicious. You have to drizzle some of the soy based sauce that they provide. It was an umami rich experience. The BBQ eel rice was hands down the best I had ever eaten. They serve it on a bed of rice along with some fluffy scrambled eggs. This dish is super rich. Im glad they added the pickled ginger to garnish. You will savor every bite with how buttery the eel and egg are.",

The place is small, busy and hectic, but you literally feel the Japanese street culture and the staff s personality through the loud yelling and fast serving.  Perfect for late dinners. Closes 11 pm on weekdays and midnight on weekends!  Highly recommended as a memorable, fun and yummy experience!!",

This is a place where I like to try new things. The vibe is awesome. It s a little lively, with the kitchen staff shouting greetings often, but that s why I like it.

I am so happy we did because they are amazing, all around. Ive been three times since! Atmosphere 5/5 Food Quality 5/5 Food Quantity 3/5 Atmosphere is so friendly and up beat. I wasnt expecting to feel so welcomed, but as soon as you walk in the whole staff greets you! They also say goodbye when you leave. - I thought that was the sweetest thing. The staff in overall is super nice. Everyone here was laughing and having a great time (socially distanced of course.) Not too loud too, I can still have a conversation at my table and not feel like Im yelling. That is SO important to me. Food quality is amazing. Ive been to some great restaurants before and I have to say, not that I love paying lots of money for food, but Guu could charge 2x as much as they do for some of the items on their menu. AMAZING dishes. GREAT for sharing. The chefs here know what they are doing. I would recommend off the dinner menu: - Sashimi Salad - Salmon Yukke - Negitoro - Tuna & Salmon Tataki (fav on the menu) - Beef Tataki - Kimchi Fried Rice (my partners fav on the menu) Food quantity is not as much for some items, like the Tataki and the Yukke. You are paying for the quality, so dont expect a feast! Some other items though, like the Kimichi fried rice, is almost TOO much food. I always go home with left overs! **Overall Im so happy I stumbled into this place because its a great time! Never should you be opposed to going off the main street (like Robson) to find a hidden gem restaurant. Guu is my fav! MUST have.",

Of all the dishes we had, the grilled squid and the sashimi were our favorites.  Wanted to try the lamb leg but it was not available and replace it with a beef tongue, however, we found the beef tongue to be just a little bit on the tougher side. They have a 28th anniversary special on right now with a picture of Sapporo and an app for 14 bucks - thats well worth it!

The kakuni  exterior was a bit dry, but the flavours in the dish were light and relaxing. The deep-fried cauliflower was good, but obviously it doesnt compare to actual meat.",

We tried several items and all of them were good. Great service! They patiently explained all the dishes and even gave some good recommendations. We sat at the end of the bar somewhat secluded and could see the entire kitchen from our seats. It was great watching folks work at breakneck pace yet make those meticulous actions. Staff all speak Japanese to each other in the stereotypical sing song way and while I dont know what exactly they were saying, seemed like positive messages every few minutes. Food was fresh and delicious. Had a cold wasabi & octopus dip with sea weed wafers and the dip was very fresh and somewhat intense (which I loved as a palette cleanser) Also had their fried chicken with dip, small Japanese hotpot, scallops pizza, and beef in sauce. The portions are small so you can try multiple dishes. Overall, good",

Sashimi lunch combo ft. yellowtail, albacore, wild caught salmon, mackerel, scallop, & poke 2. Chicken kaarage w/ garlic mayo The sashimi was super fresh and the restaurant was rly generous with the slices! I love thick slices of fish & each of the ones were amazing*_* The mackerel here was one of my favorites which is surprising considering I typically don t like it. Price: $19 CAD for sashimi/$11 CAD for chicken The price is beyond reasonable and such a steal for ALL the fresh fish that comes with the combo. It s still insane to me that the sashimi was only $15 USD!! Searching up how to obtain Canadian citizenship now",

The grilled fish took a bit of time, but IMO was worth it. The Pumpkin Egg was also excellent. Funny enough, the beef udon was my favourite! You will see options like Japanese Curry, Katsu don and Oden alongside various plates of sashimi. Quite good.

They rotate lunch and dinner menus daily on top of their core menu, so you can get something new each time you come. Like others suggested portion sizes are small but they are designed so you can try lots of dishes and share with your friends. I suggest going next door to marutama or santuka for ramen first before finishing your day off with some beer. A heated patio is also available here but sitting at the bar table is the best.",

The drinks are great but the food was amazing. We had the yellowtail sashimi which we highly recommend although the it might be on the pricier side for sushi. Also recommended is the pork cheeks with radish. As for atmosphere, this would be the type of place youd want to bring your kids to or have a quiet meal at. The restaurant resembles the classic izakaya bar/restaurant  youd normally find in Tokyo; filled with students and adults that just want a place to unwind after a long day.",

This place is definitely for those who are more adventurous with their tastes in food and are there for socializing/sharing or drinking, because the portion sizes are small and ~$10 each, so sharing is more worth it. We ordered: 2 orders of wings with sweet soy sauce, 2 orders of takoyaki, sashimi salad, grilled squid, marinated enoki mushrooms with red tuna, Saba (mackerel), and grilled grouper head, and grilled beef tongue.

My family visiting from out of town came with us and was absolutely impressed with how the food was very delicious! We were stuffed at the end and had some left overs to take home! I have been coming to this place for over a decade before they moved to this location and the food has not changed- it just too good! When im craving Korean food, this place comes to mind. Nothing can beat it! Their pork soup is to die for! The seafood pancake, bbq beef and gayoza fried and steamed are mouthwateringly yummy!!! Can t recommend this place enough to anyone I know who dig Korean food. It s a family restaurant and I find it is rare to have something delicious and family run at the same time these days. Will always come back here any season of the year! Thank you for a delicious meal each time!",

Dunno why their rating is so low - I glanced through and most of the recent reviews were 4 and 5 stars so we gave it a shot. The restaurant is located on the upper level and is super spacious. I liked that they played Kpop - but softly so that talking wasnt an issue. Service was great, our server came quickly when we pressed the call button. Maybe previous reviewers arent aware youre supposed to call? Food was good, perfect portion size for 2 people to feel very full. The egg souffle was phenomenal, and the cheese enhanced the flavors of the chicken very well. The chicken itself wasnt the best Ive had, but thats me being nitpicky. The meal was delicious overall, and very very well priced (by my NYC standards!) - came out to about $50 total after tax and tip.",

The kpop music playing in the background was a mix of old and new, and it certainly was not loud This restaurant is quite big, the staff are pretty, kind, and attentive. The food we had was the chicken bulgogi, and the soondae soup. The food was alright, its a different style from what I was used to. The banchan (side dishes) were abundant, and made well.

They have a sign on ground floor says it s opened, however, there s no sign on second floor, so we kind of feel lost and don t know where it is. Once we went up to third floor, we found the restaurant and everything is so amazing! They have a really Japanese style interior decoration which is cute and aesthetic. We ordered 3 combos and every food is tasty! Really recommend the royal bento, it s $30 but you got to try so many dishes! Will definitely recommend to others and come back!",

You can order and pay on your phone at your seat, some dishes even come with a discount if you do. All the dishes are reasonably priced and even on the cheaper end. I really loved the blend of flavors in the cool eggplant and the black cod was so fatty and tender and generously portioned! I also really enjoyed my melon drink and ice cream, very creamy and refreshing. Service was nice and very fast, we couldve been in and out in 45 minutes with how fast the kitchen was, although we ate a bit earlier during dinner when it wasnt as busy, the speed was still rather impressive.",

This was my second time visiting and they rebrand the restaurant from Guu to the current one. The ambience is still nice like previously. You order from your phone and they bring it to your table. Not a huge fan of needing to pay and tip before eating tho. The food itself was unique and flavorful. You cant find some of their dishes from other sushi store/Izakaya. We ordered pork neck, fish collar bone, roasted cauliflower, karage and mackerel pressed sushi. The pork neck and beer tonge were amazing. The karage had crunchy skin and the inside was tender and juicy. Definitely recommend checking this place out.",

What I was impressed by, however, was their great level of service and AMAZING, authentic japanese food. The tuna tataki was divine - garlic chips added a nice twist. Chicken karaage was yummy too. The best part of my night was the cajun salmon aburi/oshi - it literally melted in your mouth and the flavours worked perfectly. Absolutely loved it. Staff was extremely friendly & prices were reasonable considering Covid! I will definitely be returning. :)",

I really liked the garden around the patio which reminds me of Japan. Its the 2nd time Ive seen this system at a restaurant, ordering from your smartphone.  Such a great system to use to minimize contact as well, I am sure it helps the staff with orders going. straight to the kitchen. We both order the lunch Royal bento box and was delighted my it arrived.  Everything looked appetizing with bright colours and organized placement in the bento box with attention to detail. The Royal bento box includes: - 3 kinds of sashimi - ebi mayo - chicken and cauliflower karaage - ingren fries - bang bang e salad - saba shima sushi - grilled fish - vegetable kobachi - miso soup. My favourite were the fresh sashimi, specifically salmon and scallops.  They both melted in the mouth and you knew they were fresh.  The rest of of the items, honestly was also delicious.  The shrimp was super big and juicy in the ebi mayo.  The chicken was boneless and super moist and crunchy on the outside.  I enjoy vegetables with the bang bang e salad, cauliflower karaage and vegetable kobachi.  I was wasnt able to finish as I was quite full.  My husband gladly finished the rest of mine. If you havent tried Guu Garden, you must!  Support local by dining in (patio) or pickup/delivery.",

During covid time, they have QR code on their table that allows you to order and pay through your phone. I love the thought they put in designing their outdoor dining experience. They have heater, pretty lighting and a nice view.",

The entire restaurant feels like a rooftop patio (half of which is actually a rooftop patio). Even when youre inside, it almost feels like youre outside because of the wall to ceiling sliding glass doors. The staff were also super friendly. They had a great big smile as they welcomed us into/ushered us out of the restaurant. The food was delicious and prompt. I can recommend the Chicken Karage, the duck breast, Nasu Agebitashi, Bang Bang G Salad, and the Sake Sangria. Great spot to enjoy a nice summer day with friends and good eats.",

It s got a bit of drama when you walk up the steps to their entrance. I ve come here for both dinner and lunch but come here more often for lunch. Their lunch menu is sooooo good. I ve had all their lunch specials and my favorite is the steak one. You can add the egg to it as well as a slightly larger portion of steak, if you re feeling super hungry. The normal one is pretty generous and comes w rice, soup, pickled veggie, and salad. their izakaya one is also really good and my second favorite, as that one offers nice variety. Price is not bad for downtown sushi set lunches. they do have $10 rice bowls as well. So a good range of items depending how much you want to spend.",

We got six regular size plates and whew, they really hit all the right notes. I have a particular fondness for all things uni, so the baby scallop and uni cream croquette was just icing all over a very moist cake. We also ordered pork cheek, miso calamari, nankotsu, agedashi tofu and black cod kama. Presentation of each dish is pleasing, considering theyre mostly small fried plates, and they came out at a decent speed. Gotta say, nothing I didnt like at this place. Its not mind blowingly good, but they do everything so solidly its hard not to give them a 5.",

At the end of the night, we just put it on one bill, but I appreciated the owners patience for all the multiple questions I had. When we got there, I realized I forgot to mention that we wanted to sit outside, but since there were open tables, they gladly accommodated us. The outdoor space was beautiful and didnt feel like we were downtown, but on a rooftop little oasis. The food and drinks came out at a wonderful pace, without over crowding the table but not too slow where we were waiting too long either. There were too many dishes to name, but the stand outs were the tuna tataki, salmon oishii, beef tongue in broth with rice, grilled beef tongue, mentaiko pasta, tako wasa and salmon sashimi. We were having such a good time I forgot to take pictures. The staff here are amazing, so nice and we never felt rushed.",

As soon as we entered, we were greeted with loud welcomes from all the staff and seated prompt. The seating where you had to take off your shoes had foot warmers there to keep you warm in the colder winter days. Super nice. The staff would shout orders from right next to you to the bar if needed, so expect that when coming. :) There were a lot of Winter specials when we came and the prices were really fair for the portion. Beef tartar was one of our specials (amazing flavor, nice tender cuts that werent chewy at all). The uni and scallop croquette was nicely fried with such a rich filling. I was looking forward to finally having aburi, so I ordered the salmon off of the original menu. Nice sear on the salmon that complemented the seasoned rice, topped with warm, earthy, slightly spicy spices. So, so good. The mackerel was also really tasty, with a nicely salted fish and seasoned rice. Overall, all of the other dishes were really tasty and I enjoyed everything. The fried cheesecake ice cream was also very tasty, nothing much else like it that I ever had. Highly recommend!",

It got way too hot, and the poor lighting without it may be an issue for those who like taking pictures of their food.",

Everything is excellent with the exception of Kama which is on the sweet side but still enjoyable. Portion can be regular or small on some dishes. We had the regular.

So many variations from popular Japanese dish, but everything is in their original creative way. It seems nothing is compromised even a simple appetizer.

They have an automated ordering system where you use your smart phone to order and immediately pay for your order. Once youre done, you can just leave. They have a 2hr seating limit which is understandable in this current covid social distancing times. Btw, if you want patio seating, best to make reservations.

Their consistency with presenting solid Chinese cuisines is amazing given how long they have been in business. The restaurant has recently been renovated to look very clean and modern, offering a comfortable atmosphere for patrons. We ordered a number of fried and spicy dishes to try and all of them were exceptionally good. The braised beef was super tender yet flavourful. The fried squid was done just right to have a crunchy outer yet a chewy but tender inner. The green beans were fresh and cooked to perfection. The staff were very attentive to keep our teapot full while checking in periodically to ensure no empty dishes cluttered our table. For this level of service and quality of food, we would have expected much higher prices. Burnaby Palace is a wonderful value and a perfect hidden treasure to discover.",

Told 15 min wait, but sat 5 minutes later. The servers were attentive the whole time without being intrusive. Complimentary tea. Big menu. Ordered at 19:03 and Wor won ton soup was served to us 6 minutes later.  About 15 minutes later the rest of our dishes started arriving. The prawns and cashews were light and had lots of extra vegetables. The ginger beef was a hint cumulaticely spicy and chewy in the best way. The mandarin pork was sweet forward then tangy. My boyfriend lived in China for a little over a year so weve only been to a Chinese food restaurant once before in the 10+ years weve been together. He says well be back.",

Food is delish (favs being hot & sour soup/ steam buns/ Shanghai noodles), big portions, friendly staff. Ive been a patron for as long as I can remember, about 30 years, my parents would take me as a child when they were at their old location. Old owners Winky & Danielle were the best, very nice people, let me walk around and come see them behind the counter as a child and it was our little tradition that they would always serve me a Shirley temple in my special cup - a funny pineapple mug :) and at the end they would bring me behind the cash register and let me pick out candies and fortune cookies from the big boxes they stored them in. I have very fond memories there, many family get togethers and celebrations. Its too bad to read reviews of bad/ rude service. Its on my to do list to eat there again in the near future.",

My friend just moved to North Burnaby area and we decided to look online to find the best place with most positive reviews, we quickly realized that Burnaby palace was voted #1 For very good reason. Its a Friday night we were very hungry and also very unfamiliar with ordering Chinese food for delivery, but as soon as the guy answer the phone we knew we were ordering from the right place. He was super friendly and very patient with my questions and was very knowledgable about all the dishes available. On top of that, the very considerate delivery driver called when he was five minutes away to let us know that he will be arriving soon, and he was such a nice man, very kind and very grateful that we ordered food from his restaurant. He sincerely hoped that we would enjoy the food that he brought to us In all of the 20+ years that Ive been ordering food for delivery, Ive never had such incredible customer service! Will be calling Burnaby Palace every time we crave amazing delicious Chinese food with impeccable customer service!",

Raw sockeye, 7 kinds of Japanese side dishes, natto, fried garlic slices, pickled radish, pickled plums, etc., mixed with seaweed and wrapped in seaweed, the taste and texture are very complex. If you cant accept natto, you may want to avoid it. Cheese Tofu SOOO delicious, with a little more honey and caramel sauce on top of the cheesy tofu I used to have, so it was sweet overall. Its dense but not greasy Sashimi Salad One of my friends favorite dishes. There are scallops and yellowtail in the sashimi. The large pieces are also very fresh. Surprisingly, there are shredded radish underneath, but I dont think the sauce is refreshing enough, its not Japanese vinaigrette, its mayo Tenderloin Beef Bibimbap Probably the most average dish in the whole place. Too little sauce, so some are bland. At the beginning, the rice is sticky if the eggs are not coagulated, and the dry and fragrant rice is more delicious when there is rice in the back.",

Although they do have some sashimi on their daily special menu). Happy hour ends at 5PM unfortunately. Wheelchair accessibility: Stairs stairs stairs. You wont be able to go to the bathroom in a wheelchair. Im not sure if there is an elevator for the dine in floor either",

But persevere and you will understand the choices. It is a popular place and can be quite crowded in the evening. Reservation is recommended. We tried their steak this time. At medium rare it was soft and the seasoning was very nice. It comes cut in thin slices with a very nice sauce and fries. We also tried pan fried rock cod. It was delicious, cooked with a simple sauce in oil. They also have good beer. We had the IPA which went well with our food. We should be back here for the fish and steak.  Very nice.",

Great interior vibe and excellent staff.  Came in time for dinner menu & our server handed us a hand written menu,  with one page of many items,  which I prefer from a restaurant these days. Tried an imported rice beer, which was cold and light & my wife tried one of their cocktails. Ordered another one because it was a great drink.  Had the spicy agadashi tofu,  with an awesome sauce with just the right kick of heat.  I ordered the deep fried cauliflower with truffle mayo and the pork cheek and my wife orders the edamami and shrimp &  chicken dumplings.  Perfect portions and each dish was tasty and at the table under ten minutes.  Meanwhile they had great music in the background.  All in all,  I would recommend this place for couples and groups of friends looking to share unique dishes and partake of great cocktails in a great atmosphere.",

I enjoy trying their rotating daily specials - the best was when they offered a melt-in-your-mouth grilled king salmon. However, their regular menu is the most solid and never disappoints. Our favourites include some of the classics, such as chicken karaage, ebi mayo, and yaki udon, as well as the sashimi salad, ikamaru, beef tenderloin bibimbap, mushroom and cheese bibimbap, and kimchi udon. Since the start of the pandemic, we haven t had many chances to dine in, but have been ordering takeout from Guu with Otokomae almost weekly! Our dishes are always packaged with care - hot food is separated from cold food, they fulfil special requests (such as omissions), and the staff even write thank-you notes on the boxes. Thank you so much, Guu Gastown!",

Agedashi Tofu was yummy and so was the Sashimi Salad. Sashimi Salad tasted citrusy and refreshing it came with daikon noodle and some kind of cornflakes (or something crispy). Im not sure if the menu changed at all, but it had so less selections from what I got at Guu Garden last time. Service was fast. Guu Otokomae is definetely a good place for a hangout or a date night.",

In fact, it is our favorite restaurant in a city of great restaurants.  Everything weve had there, every time we went there, has been AMAZING! On this latest visit, we started with Takowasa.  Small pieces of raw  baby octopus legs were mixed with wasabi stems and served with nori to be wrapped.  A unique and wonderful taste and textural experience not to be missed. The Spicy Agedashi Tofu is absolutely the best weve ever had.  Small one-bite cubes of tofu is battered and deep fried, then bathed in a dashi and topped with pure goodness.  The batter is so light and thin that it serves mainly to hold the great flavor-packed dashi onto the tofu.  We slurped every bit of the fantastic dashi after finishing the tofu. The Spicy Shrimp and Pork Wontons were amazing.  The skin was a perfect al dente and the shrimp and pork filling was delicious.  With the spicy sauce, it was complete. Just when we thought that the meal was a complete success, along came the Black Cod.  It was grilled and presented in a white wine Saikyo miso sauce.  It was the most delicately textured, delectably flavored piece if fish that weve ever had. This restaurant goes on our Best Anywhere list, and we vow to come back on every visit to Vancouver.",

There is always an insane wait out the door on weekends after 10am, as with all other dim sum places in Vancouver.  I dont believe they take reservations for dim sum.  I am always trying to find places that do!  We really like the deep fried squid tentacles here as they are lightly floured and fried, without the heavy batter that some other places do.  The usual dim sum staples can be found here, at the standard prices, and the usual service as other dim sum places.   Its just an easy neighborhood low key place for us to go for dim sum.   Tables are VERY tight inside, so its tough to navigate around the tables sometimes, they really squeeze them in there.  There is parking along Kingsway in the front.",

                "review_text": "The first time we were in the area around lunch time, we didnt even notice this restaurant. So we ended up eating fried chicken nearby out of desperate hunger :-0. Then I researched the area on Google maps and found Come Along. After looking at the helpful food pictures online, I decided that we should try it next time we are in the area. I had to convince my partner to walk in because the lack of activities and people outside gave us the impression that it cant be that good. We were really surprised after we got past the front door. The place was not that big, but buzzing with activities. Lots of people eating their lunch happily. And these people looked like they are regulars. The interior even looked fresh and new. We ordered a simple lunch of fish congee, fried Chinese donuts, tofu skin with baby bok choy in vegetable broth, and shrimp dumpling. The congee was delicious. They used cod filet which was very tender. The Chinese donut was reheated so that was disappointing. The tofu skin dish was very good also, the har gow were huge. We returned for dinner another night with 5 friends. We tried Peking duck, there was duck meat attached to the skin which my friend said is the Cantonese way of doing Peking duck. The skin was crispy. The pancake was freshly made, but a bit on the thick side. They had a special on rock cod. We order a 2 lb one. It was excellent! We were all surprised how tender the cod was, usually, rock cod over 1.5 lbs tend to be on the tough side. We ordered two kinds of tofu; egg tofu with steamed dried scallops, and braised tofu with vegetables. I was not impressed with the braised tofu, it seemed dried and pre-made. The egg tofu was fine. I think we didnt necessarily pick the right mix of dishes. I did, however, see a lot of interesting dished coming out of the kitchen to other tables. The manager was friendly and helpful, and the service was pleasant. It was a Monday night, so we avoided the crowd. We intend to return to explore other dishes.",

The three cup chicken and braised pork dishes are my personal favourite as the meats are flavourful and succulent.

Most Vancouver Taiwanese restaurants serve more trendy and street-food focused dishes, and not things that Id eat at my grandmas table. Kalvins is the only place in Vancouver that Ill go to to eat food that reminds me of home. The owners are Taiwanese, and theyve been running the restaurant for 15+ years. Everything is delicious, and I would highly recommend trying dishes youve never heard of. Everything is family style and larger portions, so make sure you go with a group of at least 4. It is cash only, and parking is a bit of a challenge, but these are things I definitely dont mind when the food is that good. Reservations are recommended as it is a small restaurant with limited tables.",

If you are into dishes with intestine, they have a few! They also have frozen dumplings, wheel cakes and buns as well if you want something to go. Always make a reservation as they are super busy all the time and they don t have a lot of seats. Recommend take outs as well if you want more space. They pack your food nicely and even provide a little cardboard box for ease of carrying! Gotta love the service when they are so so busy already.",

I was so happy to find out that the restaurant was going to come back and as soon as it opened and I passed by, I dropped by with my partner to reminisce the past. The food is just as good as before, I d say the Thai fried rice was pretty much similar to what it was before but a little bit less seasoned compared to before. It could just be a hit or miss but I d say that was a 9/10. I ve always come to Etea just to order Thai fried rice. The second order was popcorn chicken nuggets, a little saltier than expected but the seasoning was really good. The portion could be bigger for $10.80 since it was a small plate but the quality is good and technically there are other restaurants that do charge it for more expensive. The Taro slush with pearls was really good, the portion size was not as large as I thought it would be but the price for the bubble tea was standard, not as expensive as other bubble tea shops and they made it well. I found it pretty interesting that there was a bear on top (it s ice) as part of the decoration. Presentation was really good, but because the cup was smaller than usual when I ordered a size large, I would say the bear takes away the portion size. Overall I would order again and their idea of putting the bear on top overall is a creative idea. Would definitely come back again, was a regular before and will be a regular as per usual. Parking: 8 spots, pretty small and weird parking spots. A few blind spots. There is street parking which is more recommended.",

The booths are more comfy! and the environment seems much brighter and welcoming than before. Hot and sour soup taste exactly as I remember! Their menu is smaller than it used to be but everything taste the same as it used to. Only downside is they no longer have parking. Overall I am so happy Etea is back",

To my surprise, everything is better than average. Their stir fried dishes are very good and their bubble tea is definitely more hongkong style than Taiwanese. If you like Hong Kong style food like me, you will like it. The place is big so you dont need to wait. Size of the dish is big also very cheap. Food will be 4 stars but add on everything, becomes 5",

They have since then knocked down the conjoined wall, and successfully expanded into multiple locations while maintaining the same authentic Mexican recipes that made them popular. Ive introduced a few friends from Mexico to their dishes and they are confirmed with authenticity. Highly recommend the chicken asada or super veg burrito ahogado (baked with sauce)   The salsas are to die for. Mouth watering flavors. Treat yourself to the canella horchata (cold cinnamon rice milk drink) its crazy delicious and hits the spot to quench your thirst and cool your palette if youre a spice lover like me. Honestly, try everything on the menu - Ive been pleasantly surprised by each item, and eat here regularly. Love that its owned and operated by Mexicans. The art on the walls is reminiscent of the film Coco and is so soothing to look at. Vegetarian options: Super Veggie Burrito or Torta, crazy yum.",

Exceptional value, food was very good, the oysters were fresh and well shucked, and the vibe is very welcoming. Restaurant is casual, and they are open pretty late. Definitely will be back, and I recommend giving this place a shot for a great, casual Izakaya with oysters",

                "review_text": "Got some dim sum via delivery on DoorDash as a sort of late Lunar New Year treat for me and my boo.  The delivery time expected was the fastest offered when I used dim sum as a search term-and they did NOT disappoint! For those of you who would like to read further, I shall elaborate.  The packaging was thoughtfully done with sturdy circular cardboard containers-not the kind I can keep as tupperware but eminently recyclable.  The sauces were kept in cute lil plastic containers inside the containers of their respective dishes-as a result of this thoughtful packaging, all foods and sauces arrived with only a few drops of spillage. We ordered a combination of hot dim sum and cold Hong Kong style iced tea as well as some frozen dumplings for later.  They were kept in appropriately separated paper bags, keeping the hot stuff hot (but not burningly so), and the cold stuff cold.  A solid A well deserved on the delivery front.  Now to taste. The frozen potstickers I ordered I sadly cannot include in this review as I have not eaten them. The Hong Kong style tea was very strong, but not very sweet.  I have a bit of a sweet tooth so I didn t love it myself but if you prefer watching your sugar intake I think you ll definitely like it. The dim sum selection wasn t huge but the items were excellent!  I had red bean sesame balls, black sesame buns, steamed shrimp dumplings, char siu (pork dumplings with a single wonton wrapping), deep fried pork buns, and popcorn chicken. I ll list them in order: Red Bean Sesame Balls: Fantastic.  I had them elsewhere and found them quite greasy.  Here they weren t, but still had their wonderful earthy character. Black Sesame Buns: My boo especially liked these due to their softness.  For me the black sesame filling was quite competently done.   Nuff said! Shrimp Dumplings: Exactly what you would expect in this town-nice, moist and warm.  Went with the mild soy sauce quite nicely. Char Siu: Wonderfully juicy.  The mild soy sauce that dripped on them slightly played off the pork brilliantly too. Deep Fried Pork Buns:  What is rich and salty for me is quite beloved by my boo, and these treats were no exception.  I let him have the majority. Popcorn Chicken:  The lone disappointment-though well seasoned, the popcorn bits were very often small enough in this dish that they could not contain chicken.  The pieces that did have chicken though were quite tasty and went quite well with a sweet ish sauce we mixed up ourselves. Overall, this delivery was extremely well done and I very much look forward to the day that I can visit this Hon s branch in person.",

It still took sometime to get one dish on the table. There are probably more staff during busier hours than one cook. Food quality was good and delicious. Price was below average and I think reasonable. Hons is well known for its quality food at good prices. Will definitely try it again when I transit at Broadway station again.",

However we came back a few more times within a month (unplanned) for the reason that its more spacious and easier to get a table for bigger group. After a few more visits this Toramasa location started to grow on me. The service from the friendly staff and food are consistently good just like their other locations. Our favorite here is still the same signature dishes like yaki udon, kimchi fried rice, pumpkin coquette, chicken karaage, and grilled fish  . My only suggestion is please add more Japanese decor because right now the inside feels a little too modern. Other than that, I would say this place is good for bigger group! If just small group like 2 people I personally prefer Thurlow location.",

                "review_text": "For those acquainted with the Guus four other locations in Downtown Vancouver, Guu Toramasa brings the familiar izakaya style experience with a focus on Osaka specialty dishes. One of their must try is the Takoyaki. Instead of serving it as is, each takoyaki comes with crackers in which you sandwich it to create a wonderful combination of both soft and crunchy. The rotating daily specials is what keeps every Guu location exciting and I highly recommend looking at it first and then choosing from their regular menu. Service at this location was also great as all staff are friendly and attentive leading to a positive experience.",

I made a reservation on open table and we were seated promptly. Ordered a few dishes to share between two people. My favorite was the smashing takoyaki with the prawn crackers ($7.80). Flavourful and fun to eat. The yaki udon ($15.50) was great with beef, mushroom, green onion and bonito flakes as well. The ikamaru ($13) had amazing umami flavor. Loved the grilled whole squid with garlic mayo. The most disappointing was the ebi mayo ($14.80)- they were not what we expected. The prawns were so small and not worth it. We were expecting the bigger ones at the other guu locations. I really enjoyed the lychee beer ($7) and service was nice and prompt.",

                "review_text": "Im sure guu has pretty high standards to their food but my experience, specifically this one, at lunch hour is very poor. Ordered a chirashi Don and that was it. The presentation  is quite fancy as it was served on a plate(instead of a bowl, where you would expect of from a don (rice bowl) item). The sashimi were all chopped up.. there were scallop, tuna, bbq eel, salmon, seaweed, the usual.. pickled radish was also in the mix which adds a nice touch. Food was generally okay, service was prompt and friendly.. I just have 2 problems: The first problem was that they seem to be trying to be fancy just for the sake of being fancy. The chirashi don had BBQ EEL in it, this is definitely atypical and I think theres reasons for it.. what are you supposed to do then, if you were to add soy sauce in for the sashimi, it would ruin the bbq eel, if you dont add soy sauce, then the sashimi is kinda tasteless (and why serve soy sauce if that was the intend? Also, everything came chopped up so its hard to pick out specific fish (in this case the bbq eel) and eat them separately.. not to mention that eating a rice dish on a plate is just clumsy (and Im Chinese).. the food is great, just not very practical. The second, and bigger problem for me is the portion. Im pretty sure a grown man can eat at least two, or even of three of these. And that even petite women could find this portion unsatisfying. I understand that guu is an izakaya place and therefore their dish is sized accordingly. But not a lot of people is going to enjoy izakaya during lunch hour. I would much rather they price it higher and just give double the portion.",

Its such a welcoming restaurant as it seems like its family owned? The food quality was so homey and I enjoyed everything we got. We asked the server who recommended us a lot of good dishes. We got the pork bone soup, sashimi bibimbap, and seafood pancake. They were all very delicious and not overly oily or salty. We were lucky to get a reservation on the day of and was seated right away. The restaurant is in a huge parking lot, so parking wasnt hard. Prices were very decent compared to Richmond or Vancouver!",

                "review_text": "A very homey type of Korean restaurant specializing in more traditional Korean cuisine. We ordered the pork back bone hot pot, shrimp tempura, pancake and bibimbap. The pork bone hot pot was super flavourful and came with a lot of pork pieces! It could ve used some more cabbage but otherwise a great dish with a complex soup base. The shrimp tempura batter was very light and crispy. The pancake was filled with lots of chives and tasted clean and not oily. I believe this restaurant excels at a  steamed seafood with bean spouts  dish as every table seemed to have ordered it. The service was prompt and efficient and restaurant was very clean.  Will come back to try the steamed seafood with bean spouts lol",

But I have decided to do a review. And I took a picture while eating lol. Ordered 2 - Spicy Fish roe soup(  ) and hot stone bowl bibimbap(     ) Spicy Fish roe soup(  ) - was SO good. No unpleasant smell fish usually have. Tasted like crab/seafood based soup. (       - clean,deep,spicy) Plenty of fish roe in it!! It comes with rice in the hot stone bowl. Hot stone bowl bibimbap(     ) - was a little bland but you could add red spicy sauce(   ). It comes with miso soup. I heard that    ,   ,      are great. I am not a big fan of Korean restaurants in Vancouver but I would definitely try out other food here as well. - Update on April10th,2022 Had codfish soup & SoonTofu soup. Codfish soup : Same great quality as spicy fish roe or even better. Clean, deep, spicy taste. Would definitely come back for this again. Soon Tofu : First taste was good. But it tastes like Korean Ramen soup. It is still better than typical soon tofu soup from other places. But I would choose other dish next time. Overall : They make quality soups. Would definitely recommend.",

It is unfortunate that they have replaced some of my favourite dish, but we still visit them every time we visit Vancouver. Most recently, we had Ah-goo jjim (steamed monkfish). I have never been a fan of this dish, but it was absolutely perfect!! Highly recommend it and its best to have fried rice with it. It is bit more expensive, but wont regret it :) Kids had their non-spicy dishes which were top class.",

And apparently, our fish was below their standard weight and they gave us another halibut tail! The meat we got was probably 3 times the amount of a one piece fish and chips, yet the same price. And their fish/tofu soup is very good, and though priced slightly higher at $16-$17, the portion is also much bigger. My wife and I got the halibut fish and a fish soup, and we could barely eat all of it because of the large portion.  One minor critique is the soup has some MSG. Will come back and try their other items.",

Even if I go alone, there are so many things I want to eat^^ Because I couldn t eat all day~ I like spicy and light taste ^^ Agujjim~ I ordered a generous portion of nutritious fried flounder and hot stew menu, savored it little by little, took it out, and enjoyed it.^^ Ah~ The steamed monkfish and fried rice packaging are a must-have~ Be sure to get it~ Parking: Ample parking space in Korean Village! Kid-friendliness: The partitions are well made. Its perfect for families or those who want to enjoy quietly.",

Since stone pot rice is provided, the taste of eating Sungnyung is amazing and the portion is generous. My child said the grilled flounder was really delicious.

If you go before 3 oclock, you can eat stone pot rice, but we ate it with stone pot rice. I couldnt take a picture because I was eating, but the flounder was very delicious and the quantity was huge. Daegu tang was very cold and delicious. It was nice to eat Jeyuk-deopbap with rice and meat on top of a stone-cooked stone pot. Three side dishes, including kimchi, were served, and I wanted the portion to be small at first, but the staff brought it to me and told me to tell you more if it was not enough, so I ate it and refilled it once more. The main portion was large, so I didnt order more side dishes, but it was really delicious. The side dishes and main dishes are really delicious, so I want to visit again next time I come to Vancouver. This is a restaurant that you can recommend to your friends. If you visit before 3pm, you can eat rice in a stone pot, so it would be nice to refer to it. Gajami tempura is highly recommended.",

I ate at Seafood 1st Street a few times, but the seasoning was good, but I was always disappointed that the bean sprouts, which account for most of Agu-jjim, were overcooked, so the water was drained instead of crispy, and the texture was thin and tough. Sols Agujjim was rumored to be good, so I ordered it after seeing a review, but the rumor is really true. The crunchy texture of bean sprouts is the same and the seasoning is delicious. However, there was too much red pepper powder and it was very spicy. Next time Ill have to order a little less spicy. Its a strong point.",
