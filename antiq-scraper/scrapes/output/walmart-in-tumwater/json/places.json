After complaining about milk which was unbagged and was placed directly on the ground,  now Walmart doesnt do it. On the contrary,  Safeway, both  corporate and Stores at  Canyon Rd and  Harrison Ave, have never corrected wrongs -  putting an unbagged milk directly on the ground, and selling  1 or 2 days old fresh salad packs and bakery items. To both Safeway corporate and both Stores, I  complained numerous times about their ignoring food safety.  Im switching to Walmart.",

I use to get my family a new mug each Christmas to have cocoa in while we read the night before Christmas. You cant buy them any more. The little jelly gift sets, my Grandma loved getting, you cant get them, and the 12 days of Christmas barbecue sauce, or hot sauce, you cant get anymore. So for my familys favorite food Christmas gifts Im going to shop elsewhere. Off to Big Lots by Capital Mall, they have lots to pick from, and great deals too.",

All was per usual for our pick up but I did comment to my husband that I thought there would be more bags.  So we head home ( an hour away ) and get home unpack the groceries and find we are missing all the protein , all the meats we ordered were not there. I called the help line on the app and talked to someone that was rude and utterly unhelpful and refused to get me her supervisor. Finally frustrated I hung up on her and called my store. The Tumwater WA store. I was told the pick up team was busy And they would call me back. I waited an hour and called the store when I got to talk to Lucas right away. He was amazing. Very sweet and was able to find my meats. I drove back to the store and called the number and Michael ( I think he said his name was ) can hustling right out and loaded it up for me. He was also really nice and easy.  Maybe it was just me figuring this would be another battle but the local store was so helpful and just plain nice.  You guys are being an amazing job and this sick old lady sure appreciated these two gentleman. I really hope this get back to their bosses and they are at the very least acknowledged for being super hero s today.  Thank you so much.",

The first thing I noticed was how pleasant the greeter was, like she actually was happy to see us. I also appreciated that she let me put my husbands seizure dog in the cart (under the basket on a blanket) and didnt make him walk. After the 15 hour drive our normally relaxed service dog was as out of sorts as we were. It really did mean a lot. Everything in the store was easy to locate, it was a bit crazy to see how well layed out they had their store in preparation for black Friday. The arrows on the ground were a kick! Self check out was easy and there was no wait. The lady who checked our receipt was nice and let me wait to the side while my husband got the car, as it was pouring and we were not prepared. Were actually planning on moving to Washington in the next year and this seems like a very friendly community. Thanks!",

This time we had to shop for shoes for my boys and we were able to find what were looking for a fairly quickly. All employees were very polite and happy to help if I had a question. I was able to find some vegan shredded cheese and a new brand that I had heard about that hadnt tried so I was very excited for that, I think it was Follow your Heart vegan cheese also CHAO. Were trying to reduce plastic so it was a little disappointing that the sweet potatoes and certain other vegetables and fruits were wrapped in Plastics or bagged. However they also had the Dyia cheese gluten-free pizzas which I have been wanting to try, I was also very happy about that. A pretty good variety of different things at the store we also have meat eaters in our family. Husband was able to get the shrimp he needed, lunch meat and regular Dairy like milk and cheeses no problem. Lots of good sales and prices in general the few things that we werent able to get I was able to get at a store near our a house as Walmart is a bit far from my home.",

                "review_text": "U need it, they most likely have it, except for Big Red soft drinks. They dont carry it anymore. Which is one reason they dont get five stars! They are open 24 hours also which is great! Only problem is if u shop at night, they all look at u like ur gonna steal something.. as if thieves are the only ones awake after 11pm.grrr... They are no longer open 24 hours. My review is really one star! But I had to make sure the maximum number of people see this! New Info! CAUTION RECOMMENDED! If you want to catch COVID this is the place to shop! This has been since the mandate was lifted. I happen to know one of their employees (who shall remain nameless). Contracted Covid, tested positive, was home for 3 days. Had no more leave- still testing positive. Was told by management at Walmart that company policy states they come to work or risk being terminated! Even tho they were testing positive for the Corona Virus!! So  with as many people as their are shopping at Walmart. It s safe to say, they are the biggest reason The Corona Virus is still a problem!! They are a national chain!! This is Walmart s standard practice!! Spreading the Virus!!!",

I got great customer support from at least 3 employees tonight who all, quickly assisted me in locating items and navigating through the store. I was in and out faster than I anticipated with their help. The store was clean and well staffed. I especially liked the fact that the floor mats at the entrance were maintained and not left soaking wet. They were mostly dry when I walked into the store. Highly reccomend this Wal-Mart store to anybody looking for great service.",

Maybe its just that its so big, maybe its that I havent been there during peak times, Im not sure.
