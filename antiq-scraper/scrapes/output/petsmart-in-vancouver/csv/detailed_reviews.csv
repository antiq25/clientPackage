The service employee,   Chris,   went above and beyond to help me find products,    and he found an on sale I needed,   but didnt see.   Chris was very patient,   calm,   knowledgeable,   and is an example of what customers like myself appreciate when  shopping,   especially in a big box store.    I also liked their wide selection of products,    and their prices are not any more expensive than other pet supply stores.    Thank you,   Chris.

On my quest for 11 neon tetras, dog food, and other pet essentials, I was prepared for a whirlwind of an experience. And let me tell you, dear readers, Pet Smart did not disappoint! The moment I entered, I was greeted by a symphony of meows, barks, and the gentle swish of fish swimming in their tanks. Like a seasoned conductor, Pet Smart had orchestrated a harmonious blend of products and services to cater to a wide array of pets and pet parents alike. With my eyes set on the aquatic section, I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of fish on display. The neon tetras, in particular, caught my attention. They shimmered like tiny aquatic gems, boasting vibrant hues of red and blue. With the help of an attentive staff member, I handpicked 11 of these underwater dazzlers to take home to my own aquatic kingdom. Next on my list was dry and wet dog food, and Pet Smarts selection was nothing short of a canines dream buffet. From grain-free options to high-protein and even gourmet choices, the variety was extensive and tail-waggingly delightful. I managed to find the perfect balance of nutrition and flavor for my furry companion, leaving me feeling like a true doggy connoisseur. As for the other supplies, Pet Smart offered a plethora of options for both fish and dogs. From aquarium filters and heaters to leashes and chew toys, I found myself lost in a maze of pet care nirvana. The stores organization and knowledgeable staff made navigating through this treasure trove of pet supplies a breeze.

I have visited most Petsmarts in the lower mainland and I often saw little hamsters and mice running on wheels that are not only dirty but also way too small for them (it would hurt their spines). And they often lived in smelly cages (pee soaked bedding) and having only pellets (no nutrients) for food. But this Petsmart in North Vancouver provide their rodents with proper size(bigger) and clean wheels to run on, their beddings are clean, and they even give them a variety of fresh vegetables for snacks alongside pellets! I saw happy and healthy  mice exercising on the wheels and comfortably cuddling with each other today. They were so comfortable with humans(thanks to the kind people who take good care of them) they would come out and curiously sniff us. I m so happy for the animals to be taken such good care of.
