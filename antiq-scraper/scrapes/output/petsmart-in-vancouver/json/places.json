I adopted a hamster, and two skinny pigs from this location. They made sure to gently pick up the hamster and didn t hold him on his back. Because they handled him so carefully he was a really sweet hamster and didnt bite us at all. In fact he would actually kiss us and lick our faces!  With the skinny pigs the employees recommend we buy two, so we did. They said good bye to them and put them in a large bin instead of a tiny box because they didnt want the skinny pigs to accidentally scratch each other. One is sassy and thick, and the other one is a cute gentle sweetie",

There were about seven different models, each of sturdy construction and on average, atleast 20 bucks cheaper than the usual suspects (Rhymes with Slam Azon) Then a staff member, after asking if I needed help, politely informed me that those were just the ones on display, and showed me to a warehouse sized mecca of pet beds, taking up almost the entire rear of the store!! Holy Moses!! There were so many choices, it felt like choosing a new toothpaste/deodorant brand. I picked up a large dog bed and a topper for my sassy house cat and he actually loves it!  Hes a big stretcher, so a normal cat bed just didnt cut it. I would definitely recommend this store, the staff were friendly and helpful, and I found everything that I needed in one trip to one place.",

I was so scared of being refused because of his aggression while waiting outside but the trainer went to check how he was doing for me between her lessons(I guess that was on her break). That made me feel safe and comfortable.  Thank you so much for all helps. This is the only grooming place Ill take him.",

I normally dont shop here because its not in my neighbourhood,   but saw it while driving by and decided to check it out.    The service employee,   Chris,   went above and beyond to help me find products,    and he found an on sale I needed,   but didnt see.   Chris was very patient,   calm,   knowledgeable,   and is an example of what customers like myself appreciate when  shopping,   especially in a big box store.    I also liked their wide selection of products,    and their prices are not any more expensive than other pet supply stores.    Thank you,   Chris.    I hope the Petsmart management recognize and value your contribution to customer service,    its employees like you who help me  decide to shop there again.    Thank you !",

The location is just a short block walk from the skytrain.  The prices could make you weep, so all I can say on that note, is that the prices everywhere else seem to be just as bad, if not worse, which is also why I go there.  The toy selections are really good too. Very pet friendly, of course, I always meet a new dog friend or 2 when I go there.  Also, the cashier was very funny when I accidentally handed her the competitions savings card instead of the PetSmart card.  Said it happens all the time.   It took me about 15 minutes to spend $52 on cat food, half wet (cans), half dry.  My girl is a very happy kitty   tonight! She keeps going back to her dish for more kibble,  like every ten minutes.  I may have to ration her severely.   CHEERS everyone, love your furry friends, they so deserve it.",

Michelle was his groomer for the day, and she was so sweet putting my dog (and me) at ease. He had the full package   a haircut, his nails clipped, a bath... all of the above + some extras. When I picked him up, Michelle gave me some tips & tricks on what I can do to make his next appointment easier (i.e. she said he didn t like his chin being touched, so I should train him to make him comfortable with that). That was super helpful! And despite the fact that we re still in Phase 2 of Covid-19, and they re not allowed to have 2+ stylists on a dog (for their physical distancing safety), Michelle still did a really good job with my dog s nails solo. I would definitely recommend this location and Michelle as a stylist to anyone.",

Very spacious, clean and well arranged, a lot of foods, treats, toys, clothes, accessories, and other stuffs for your pets. As far as I noticed, they cover dogs off course, cats, fish, birds, reptiles, and other small pets (like rabbits, hamster, guinea pigs, even rats and mice). Although I never used their service, but hard to miss that they also have grooming and training facilities. For the clothes, I found not too many choices, but for food and treats they have quite a lot options to choose. Installing their phone apps is worth it, where we can find promotion info, check stock availability, online shop, book appointment for services, etc. For Petsmart, keep up the good job!",

                "review_text": "As I waltzed into Pet Smart with my shopping list in hand, I couldnt help but feel a sense of excitement bubbling up within me. On my quest for 11 neon tetras, dog food, and other pet essentials, I was prepared for a whirlwind of an experience. And let me tell you, dear readers, Pet Smart did not disappoint! The moment I entered, I was greeted by a symphony of meows, barks, and the gentle swish of fish swimming in their tanks. Like a seasoned conductor, Pet Smart had orchestrated a harmonious blend of products and services to cater to a wide array of pets and pet parents alike. With my eyes set on the aquatic section, I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of fish on display. The neon tetras, in particular, caught my attention. They shimmered like tiny aquatic gems, boasting vibrant hues of red and blue. With the help of an attentive staff member, I handpicked 11 of these underwater dazzlers to take home to my own aquatic kingdom. Next on my list was dry and wet dog food, and Pet Smarts selection was nothing short of a canines dream buffet. From grain-free options to high-protein and even gourmet choices, the variety was extensive and tail-waggingly delightful. I managed to find the perfect balance of nutrition and flavor for my furry companion, leaving me feeling like a true doggy connoisseur. As for the other supplies, Pet Smart offered a plethora of options for both fish and dogs. From aquarium filters and heaters to leashes and chew toys, I found myself lost in a maze of pet care nirvana. The stores organization and knowledgeable staff made navigating through this treasure trove of pet supplies a breeze. In the end, my experience at Pet Smart was akin to a tango with my beloved pets - a dance of delightful discoveries and well-executed moves. With a cart filled to the brim with neon tetras, dog food, and other essentials, I couldnt help but feel grateful for this one-stop pet utopia. Pet Smart, you have truly outdone yourself, leaving this pet parent more than satisfied and ready for an encore. Bravo!",

Our Cats, before they got spayed and neutered had a kitten together and raised it, so we were hoping they would adopt Miley as their own - and after less then 24 hours the new family has already bonded. Miley seems very happy here and in-between the cuddling she loves to run around and explore the place. Shes also very affectionate and loves to eat. We would recommend PetSmart if you are considering adopting a kitten.",

Across the street is Michaels craft store and Tim hortons. Theres also a sun given foods grocery store in the same parking lot. Thats actually the most challenging part of attending this store is the parking which can be quite busy. Otherwise the store is great because its so large and serves all types of pets from dogs and cats to small mammals, fish and reptiles as well. Of course they have food for all these types of animals which is great because we have a snake and are always looking for a local supplier. The store is always clean and not too busy period they have grooming services as well as dog training services. There is a had adoption centre at the front of the store. There seems to be enough staff that work here to provide a good customer experience overall. Value for money is what you would expect at a pet store and overall the experience is excellent. Definitely will come again.",

I wasnt sure of the correct puppy food and spoke with a staff member and she gave me alot of good info and advice. The salon did an awesome trim and gave me a record of what services were performed on coco. From that Its easy to keep track of what you are paying for and what needs to be done next time. All in all a great store for everything!",

I have been nothing but happy with the professionalism and detail of work shown by both Jade and Julie. I regrettably took him somewhere else for his last groom, a mistake which I will not be making again. I will be back to Petsmart for his next full groom before we move cities. Thank you!",

She was always willing to answer our questions, give different suggestions and really cared about making sure we understood every topic and assisted us whenever we were struggling to do certain exercises with our dog.

Ever since Stephanie took over as salon manager, the salon has become SO MUCH BETTER. My dog is reactive and Stephanie is the ONLY one she lets groom her - which she always does an amazing job! Its obvious that PetSmart as a corporation cares more about money and their customers than it does its employees, but I can tell that the salons priority is taking care of the pets and making them feel comfortable. I cant imagine having to deal with reactive dogs and rude customers everyday, but they do an amazing job.",

I have visited most Petsmarts in the lower mainland and I often saw little hamsters and mice running on wheels that are not only dirty but also way too small for them (it would hurt their spines). And they often lived in smelly cages (pee soaked bedding) and having only pellets (no nutrients) for food. But this Petsmart in North Vancouver provide their rodents with proper size(bigger) and clean wheels to run on, their beddings are clean, and they even give them a variety of fresh vegetables for snacks alongside pellets! I saw happy and healthy  mice exercising on the wheels and comfortably cuddling with each other today. They were so comfortable with humans(thanks to the kind people who take good care of them) they would come out and curiously sniff us. I m so happy for the animals to be taken such good care of. Thank you guys so much NV Petsmart!",

I got an early morning appointment at 8:15 AM so she was the first one in the door. I asked for an especially thorough de-shedding, and I can t be happier with the results. I even took her into the park just to do a quick brushing after and I barely can get anything off of her. Will definitely use Petsmart grooming from now on.",

We had originally booked somewhere else but they refused our puppy as she was a little matted but the groomer at Pet Smart took our puppy and did an excellent job!  Josie was patient, kind, professional and answered all of our questions. She took such great care of our puppy and I could tell our puppy was in great hands as she seemed calm when Josie held her. Thank you for making our 1st grooming experience an awesome one! We will definitely be back!!!",

I love the interior store layout--it doesn t feel like a traditional big box store. It feels more cozy, almost like an independent, locally-owned neighborhood shop.  The store associates with whom I interacted were friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and quick.  This location is next to a lot of other stores that I already shop at, so it s super convenient too.  This is West Vancouver s new premier destination for all of your pet supply needs.  Bravo PetSmart!",
