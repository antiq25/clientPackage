It is Nov 13th 2016 in the afternoon. Its not terribly busy, theres 2 floors with the upstairs hosting one of the rare play places, and the service is on point. I walked in, saw the digital ordering kiosks. I love how amazingly powerful they are. Dont forget that you can tap on an order and hit Customize to go crazy with the most granular possible nit picky stuff you can think of.  Today the Build Your Taste burger builder was fully integrated and let me absolutely get the details I wanted. Once the order was complete it got me to pick up an elecronic device known as a Table Tracker, this allowed me to bring my kid upstairs to the play place with my number and pretty close after ordering two gentlemen came upstairs with my order on a wooden paddle, and my daughters happy meal carried separately and carefully. The men asked us if we wanted any condiments, to which we asked for ketchup to which they happily obliged. No restaurant, especially fast food, has evolved over time quite like McDonalds. I though McCafe was a pretty big deal when it came around but now McDonalds seems to be catering to thise who want real food, with real service one could experience at a standard family restaurant.  Except i dont have to wait 35 minutes to an hour gor my order to come about. I imagine it wont be like this all the time, in fact im pretty sure to expect just like what happened to FatBurger. Sure everyones enthusiastic now, give it a month and some change and well be back to old habbits.

Its been there for everyone when the economy was declining, and when it was booming. McDonalds drives with the economy (not drive THE economy) because it is practical.

Take a good honest look at yourselves then evaluate and filter your thoughts before allowing yourself to speak negative about McDonalds. Dont over estimate yourselves, a lot of you are rich but in debt and still frequent McDonalds then trash talk about it. Warren Buffet frequents many fast food places, so why should yall speak?

Gives us less space but the upstairs seating gives a bit more space to make up for it, for some reason the waiting area for your order is small, and gives less space for a dine in, overall I wouldnt say its bad and one my favourites, its just a fast food chain there that exists. Also Ive noticed that their not open 24/7, which is stupid by me, overall I think you should go outside to the fountain and eat there, but I think were lucky we got upstairs.",a year ago,2022-11-22 02:48:11.111425,,,,1,14,2,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109196801890091227996/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

They even have handicapped door buttons you can use your foot! (I want to give a 5 star just for that. Its so cool!) But it was really small, and they close the upper floor at night. But the reason Im giving a 3 star was because the staff gave us spoons for our icecream, and put it ON THE COUNTER. Where cash, coins and peoples hands TOUCH. I worked at multiple food industry places. If he did that in my workplace, he wouldve gotten fired immediately. I hope the other staff have basic food safe knowledge, and training because that alone is a huge red flag.

They are great sometimes but when they are not they absolutely suck. I ordered a Quarter Pounder without Cheese and a Orange Juice. I also got a snack wrap for my friend. Their Orange juice was watery and the burger lacked sauce. This was a time that they sucked. Good but I recommend Metrotown or Still Creek over this.
