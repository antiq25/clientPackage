While there was a bit of miscommunication that led to a bit of delay on the installation (set-up logistics mishap from not seeing the layout of my condo prior to the install team coming in), overall experience on everything else was superb. The reps on the phone were very nice and helpful. The install team that showed up were very professional, nice, and worked very hard to problem-solve the logistics issue while ensuring all strata codes are followed and I was fully satisfied with their proposed solutions (trust me, you dont want to fall out of compliance from Strata rules). Would highly recommend their services to anyone.",

He figured it was a faulty thermostat and quoted for the supply and install of a new one.

He took the time to diagnose the issue properly unlike other technicians Ive had before who diagnosed wrong. He kept the workplace tidy and clean. He also offered a service membership which I signed up for considering it gave a 15% service discount immediately. Shawn is the guy you want to call if you have hvac issues, 10/10 service and expertise.",

Ashton phone staff were very friendly and set up appointment quickly as the water was totally shut off due leak and task was assigned to Carlos. The leak was in awkward spot and Carlos had to come up with a creative way to get the job done. Carlos is a true professional I could easily see that this time the repair to the pipe was done correctly.  He also recommended to update poly b pipes and took the time to explain the reason for his suggestion, he encouraged me to do my own research so I could make an informed decision.   I felt at ease and Carlos was able to answer all my questions. All work has now been completed including replacement of pressure reducing valve and poly b pipes. Carlos has sound experience in his trade and truly cares about his customers.  Thank you Ashton and Carlos, I know I can count on you. :) Bobbie Dhaliwal",

I didnt have any luck resolving it myself so I called a few places, Ashton being of one them to get an idea how soon I could have a technician take a look but also how they quote.  Every company quotes differently meaning some based on the job and then hourly or every half hour plus a call out fee, etc.  If theyre trying to resolve an issue without actually being on site thats where it could impact you financially when you get the invoice and they dont disclose what charges you may expect upfront.  Originally a tech was scheduled for later in the afternoon next day.  I received a call quite early this morning informing me they had a cancellation and a tech could be at my place in half an hour. Johnny B arrived within 30 minutes of that phone call and the service provided was definitely appreciated.  He took a look then informed me what he recommended should be done and gave me an approximate cost before proceeding.  He was upfront about the fact that it may take longer due to the fact that the pipes were clogged and depending on how far down the line the clog was it may take time to completely resolve the issue.  Again transparent and upfront with the potential for extra charges.  Once the clog was removed he tested a few times to ensure water was draining as it should.  Site was cleaned as if nothing ever happened.  As for the most important part the invoice - that was as quoted so no surprises.  This is the second time Ive used Ashton for plumbing services and both experiences for me were great.",

Johnny didnt just meet her expectations; he exceeded them in every way. She was first impressed by Johnny s punctuality. He arrived right on time, something that s unfortunately not common these days. He was immediately ready to assess the situation with her sink and furnace. After listening to her concerns, Johnny quickly diagnosed the issues. Her sink faucet was broken and her furnace was overdue for servicing. With expertise and skill that can only come from experience, Johnny walked her through his planned steps to resolve the issues, ensuring that she understood what needed to be done and why. Johnny wasted no time getting to work. He efficiently replaced the faucet, ensuring that the pipes were clear of any obstruction. Then he moved onto the furnace. she was genuinely impressed by how thorough he was in servicing it, even identifying a minor issue that could have turned into a major problem down the road. He fixed it right away, saving my mother-in-law future headaches and potential costs. After completing the job, Johnny made sure the work areas were cleaner than when he arrived. There were no traces of debris or any mess, which she greatly appreciated. Throughout the process, Johnny was communicative and friendly. He answered all her questions and even gave her useful tips on maintaining her plumbing and heating systems, which was invaluable advice that she plans to follow. Johnny s expertise, professionalism, and exceptional customer service make him a standout technician. She wholeheartedly recommends him and Ashton Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning for any household repair and maintenance tasks. Its service providers like Johnny who turn a potentially stressful situation into a seamless and even enjoyable experience. If youre in need of plumbing, heating, or air conditioning services, do yourself a favor and ask for Johnny. You wont be disappointed! Frazer Roland on behalf of Christa Thews",

Great experience: - booking the appointment was easy, the call center staff are very friendly and responsive - got a call the morning of the service noting the tech was 40 minutes out and he showed up within the announced time - our tech, Johnny, was very thorough and professional. He answered all of our questions and gave us some good tips on maintenance. The written report provided is very comprehensive and is a good reference. - he explained the suggestions for any repair/preventative maintenance (which was also delivered by email so we could review and consider).",

For this years pre-Fall service of our furnace, aged 13, George and Sean arrived on time, and started promptly.  Try as they both might from every angle over hours that extended beyond the usual time for such a service, they could not get the furnace to fire up; only the fan was working.  So, with great regret on their part, they spoke about and explained in detail various replacement options.  Ultimately, we arranged for the purchase and delivery of a new furnace.   Despite the severely bad news, we enjoyed having George and Sean in our home, and very much appreciated their hard work, professionalism, friendly interaction with us, and expertise.

Mo Meherzad sold us the units and he was a delight to work with; he was very friendly and straight forward. He checked in on us throughout the installation and even afterwards, to make sure we were satisfied. Qasim Sarwar was our lead installer and he was great. He was a delight to have in our home each day: very friendly and hard working. Its a big job to install a heat pump in a townhome, because of all the shared walls and strata rules, but Ashton problem solved and made it work so we were happy with how it looked. Their customer service was top notch and everyone we dealt with was great. On top of that, the air pump works great so were happy customers!",

After the initial phone call, they sent a sales associate (comfort advisor) to our home to look at and advise what would best suit our situation.  Our advisor Arde was very patient in explaining and addressing our needs and concerns, which was the main reason we decided to go with Ashton. At our install, the lead technician Bejan was very professional and did a top-notch job.  He and his team were able to troubleshoot challenges that came up and explained things to us every time we had a question or concern.  Throughout the entire project, Bejan was very detail-oriented and did the job the right way.  Everything was done to code (or better), no cutting corners. Overall, the service was excellent from start to finish.  Its only been a few days, but the system is working perfectly, as a brand new system should.  I also liked the fact that they give you the price upfront, with no hidden costs.  What I paid at the end was exactly what was quoted at the beginning.  I 100% recommend Ashton and would use them again in the future. Services: Heating system installation , Install thermostat",

Mo, our advisor and point of contact has been fantastic and we are very impressed so far with the customer service. Mo initially gave us a quote for 2 systems, including $15,000 of rebates and coordinating the additional quotes for the electric panel upgrade to 200amp (which maybe required depending on the property) and drywall repair. We planned to chose the cheaper system but by the time we received the additional quotes and agreed to proceed the cheaper heat pump was on back order and one of the rebates was full subscribed. Ashton kindly agreed to supply the higher priced unit for no extra charge with an additional discount due to the unexpected sudden loss of the rebate. Mo was always contactable and answered all our questions. Ashton and Mo have given us exceptional service. We are currently having the heat pump installed and so we plan to write another review once complete. Update: 3 months after initial installation (July 2023) of the heat pump. Our electric upgrade has now completed. It took about 3 months due to technical reasons from BC hydro. Most of the delays were waiting for inspectors to review the electric upgrades during the process and BC being available within their 3 month predicted completion date. Over all we were very happy with both the electric up grade and heat pump. Ashton returned to our property to complete a final inspection of all the work done. We are now only waiting for the city to provide permits for all the work which we have been told can take several months. The quality of the workmanship has been excellent and on the whole Ashton remained quick to reply to questions/emails throughout. I would recommend using their services and will continue to use them in the future. Service: Heating system installation",

Our second part was to upgrade our hot water tank, done by JAPN and KARAN.  Both were once again extremely competent and professional.  All communication with Ashton from the set-up consultation to the completion of the project was wonderful.  Prices were set up to meet our needs and there was no pushy salesperson.

They have an extensive beer menu (as you would expect). The food menu is also extensive with fairly typical food options for this type of establishment (burgers, wings, pizza, etc.). I had the 1/2 ribs and they were phenomenonal. The meat was super tender and just fell off the bone. What made the accompanying fries so good was a tomato/garlic dipping sauce, which was sublime. They should bottle and sell that stuff! Im not sure what the rest of the menu was like, but for the ribs alone its worth trying! The service as slick and professional. I could easily have stayed for a couple more beers if I wasnt fighting jetlag.",

                "review_text": "If you go, I dont know if youre going to love it. What I can tell you is that when I went it was perfection. Yes, perfection. Ill tell you why. It was a chill weekend lunch and we stopped by for just a burger, lager and a small appetizer. Our server (Sally) was absolutely lovely. She waited on us hand and foot and did it with a smile the entire time, and she had other tables and watching her conduct herself with such quality consistency was refreshing. So, thats for the service. Now the food. The YBC Cheeseburger was everything I look for in a cheeseburger. Juicy, well-seasoned, smart ingredient proportionality and it was actually hot when it arrived, which very rarely happens with burger dishes. Burgers arriving at the table hot is like a Unicorn....no, Ive never seen a Unicorn, but you know what I mean.... The fries...well..the fries were everything a fry should be. It was crispy on the outside, cooked with quality oil and steaming hot and flakey on the inside while you bit in and seasoned just right. Technically it was a perfect serving of fries and it tasted absolutely amazing. Honestly, I was almost going to order a second serving of just fries, but you know.....calories and all that... The Fish tacos for once were cooked the way they are supposed to be cooked if youre not trying to rip your guests off. Perfect ratio of batter and fish, which means you tasted the beautiful juicy cod as the primary source of flavour while the batter complimented and served as a finish to its protein counterpart. Oh!....and it was so very fresh! The lager was yummy, they make their own stuff and I had a second one. I think youll have a great experience. Id be surprised if you dont. They cant be this good and be inconsistent.",

This brewpub has it all, from a fantastic selection of beers brewed in-house to a menu with delicious options. But what really sets Yaletown Brewing Co. apart is the incredible service provided by their staff. When we were planning a large group gathering, we reached out to the restaurant for help with reservations. Anushree and Natasha went above and beyond to ensure that our experience was smooth and stress-free. They were friendly, responsive, and accommodating, and we couldnt have been happier with their service. When we arrived, we were greeted warmly and shown to our tables promptly. The atmosphere was lively and inviting, and the menu offered something for everyone. We sampled a few of the brews on tap, and they were all so good. Overall, we had a wonderful experience at Yaletown Brewing Co., and were grateful to Anushree and Natasha for making it all possible. We highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a great meal and a great time in Vancouver!",

                "review_text": "** UPDATE ** After a speedy response from management we were promptly invited back and overall had an amazing experience with great food, drinks, and above and beyond service! Aisha and Tristen were professional and accommodating, and we couldn t be happier with the overall experience. Updated our rating accordingly. ** We ate at this establishment last night and will not be returning. If I could give zero stars I would. TL;DR: Extremely poor management, unclear billing, and poor treatment of staff! Ill start this off by saying our server was extremely sweet and none of this review is to reflect her in anyway. I called roughly an hour before to try and book a reservation, but was told they do not do same day reservations, but they accept walk ins. Ok no problem. So I asked if it was currently busy and if there would be a long wait to which I was told, I dont know, I cant tell you. Followed by the hostess hanging up on me. Fast forward an hour and there was less than 7 tables occupied in the entire restaurant when we arrived. We were seated outside next to one of their growler displays and while we were waiting for our food I noticed a live mouse running inside the glass display. Not the prettiest sight to see before eating your meal, however, the waitress moved us tables without any hesitation. Secondly, my girlfriend wished to substitute chicken instead of steak in her dish, which was confirmed as not a problem by the kitchen for a small upcharge. Little did we know that small upcharge was $9.44 for 4 THIN STRIPS of a chicken breast on top of the $24 original bowl price. See attached photo and try and find the entire chicken breast. Lastly, after our bill had come to $150, the manager had brought out our to go food order, and we asked a question regarding the cost for chicken, to which she rudely replied we do not do substitutions so we have to upcharge to make it work. Is chicken not cheaper than steak? If anything this establishment just saved money by giving chicken instead of steak as the protein in this meal. Furthermore, we ordered two orders of their honey siracha wings,  one came to $17.85 and the other $15.27, why you might ask? No one knows. Seeing that my girlfriend was rightfully annoyed by this, the manager said she would be right back. A few moments later our waitress came back to us with $10 cash and apologized for her mistake. What mistake you might ask? Your guess is as good as mine, but if you ask management it was probably the servers mistake not telling us there would be a $10 upcharge on the meal. To which my girlfriend asked her did they make you give us this money out of your own pocket? and the waitresses response was less than lack luster. Well... yes but it was my fault. We insisted that she keep the $10 because thats absurdly ridiculous of management to make the waitress pay out of her own pocket for that. If the billing and rude manager wasnt reason enough for us not to return, the way management treated our waitress and forced her to pay out of her own pocket was the deciding factor. We will not be returning.",

I was given an email to make a claim, and I was promised I would get refunded in the coming days after I contacted them. I decided to change my review to 5 stars because there was nothing wrong with the beers and more importantly, not many restaurant do a follow up with their clients to make amend. It felt good to know someone somewhere is listening. ORIGINAL (1 Star): We had beer only and realized after I got home I was charged a Moscow Mule by server with initial B. Make sure you check your bill before you leave the restaurant. Lesson learned.",

This brewery should be rated higher,  in my opinion.  We had two flights after trying to pick from the 40 beers (all but cider brewed by them). The flights were great. The spot had plenty of seating and some skinny chicken wings, but dont let that discourage you. The sweet and spicy rub were bomb. Ended up, walking away with a mix pack and the yummy torque IPA. A new must try for our Vancouver trips",

You should know that you must first order your food and drink before sitting down. Food is best ordered to share, even though the portion sizes arent the biggest, they arent the smallest either, nor are they the best presented dishes. For a brewery, this place has a decent kitchen, mostly fried offerings.  Where they really excel, is the choice and quality of beer! They definitely have something for every beer lover in terms of flavors. I typically like to sit on their outdoor patio, but the inside of the building is also a great spot to hang out. Overall, if you have a large group of people and want to catch up, this place will seat you almost immediately and will feed everyone, within a reasonable budget.",

The washrooms have cool bright graffiti painted on the walls. Theyre baby friendly and have high chairs that are tall like a high chair for a bar. The drinks are great and the food was just as good.

Nice outdoor patio, and they had an octoberfest patio going too. Inside, at least 20 taps, ranging from cocktails and seltzers, and a slew of different beers. Clearly something for everyone. Nice choice of food too, made to order in a food truck tucked inside. We really liked it here.",

Tucked away deep in the old industrial area, Parallel 49 is an oasis with a spacious beer garden that might even make a German miss home a little less. Trust that you will find an innovative beer menu in addition to the common staples that arguably are starting to show their age. Despite its name, the Filthy dirty is a well-balanced North West style IPA that is a solid choice for hop heads. However, should the seasonal Cobra Clutch still be on tap, why would you order anything else? It is a masterpiece and on its own merits the trek. Oh, and the food is pretty decent, too.",

Huge selection and so many great options. My fave was the Scot....caramel flavours and very smooth. For lunch we tried the wings and tacos. Everything was outstanding. Loved the salt and vinegar wings. They were so different and yummy. The poutine was also delicious. Great fries. Lots of seating. Open and comfortable area to enjoy drinks. Very nice staff.",

Yay: - I liked the amount of seating, as well as stools that are not too high for kids or shorties like me & had back rests (it s the little things). - Loved the splashes of colour! - Food truck kitchen was so awesome & exciting for my kids. - The food was delicious! We loved the herby, garlicky pretzel, poutine, and tater tots. Was nice to see kid-friendly options. - So many options of drinks! - Lots of free street parking - Cider enthusiast option: Blueberry Jelly Monster was the closest thing. Yum! Boo: - Zero cider options!!! BAH - Muddlers: served in a mason jar with ice!!! Ahhhh. I can t drink it fast enough for the drink not to get all watered down. You gotta chug it so it doesn t get gross. I couldn t even finish it. Blagh. Tip: Maybe frost the glass instead, lose the ice. Maybe add a lemon slice or something? - Servers weren t so friendly  or are they not allowed to speak to patrons/have friendly conversation?? If so, disregard this last comment! >_< All-in-all, I would maybe go back if they had even one yummy cider option. The food is definitely yummy. Update 2/4: They had a cider option & it was delicious!! What a difference to drink cider out of the tap. And I don t have to drive all the way to Burnaby for yummy cider in great vibes. So happy I went back!!",

I cant say much about all the beers, but the ones I have tried I can say that they are unique and some that are really good. The food we ordered was the Fish tacos and the fries (I cannot remember the name, also its off the menu now). The tacos must be one of the best fish tacos I have ever had, and the fries were so good that they went well with all the beers. I love IPAs so I had a double IPA and their annual Filthy Dirty IPA. Both great beers! The second time we came here I had all Barley wines. I was so tipsy after my flight. You can see my picture on how thick the beers were. The one that surprised me the most was the whiskey barrel aged barley wine. Now if youre a whiskey lover and a beer lover, I say this is the beer for you! It absolutely blew my mind how much it had the flavours of whiskey. Great place to come and have great food and great beers! But it gets busy so get there early!",

The Midnight Train beer - Rum aged is to die for. Cheers! or Prosit! as they say. Update: Nov 2021- patio and beer garden gone for the season. Unfortunately so is all the dark delicious beer, like porters and stouts. Dozens of beers on tap and yet absolutely nothing on but light, American-style IPA and fruity beers. Seems the fate of so many Vancouver brewers to go the lazy route and resort to cheap and easy to produce kid -friendly (young inexperienced drinkers) beers.

Fingers crossed on those two beers becoming regular shipping-ready brews because they are absolutely fantastic, and frankly, P49 dont seem to export too many darker brews/stouts, so it would be awesome to see those two as their showcase set. I cannot say enough good things about those two, if theyre in rotation you must try them! Regretfully, the casino royale ran out before I could try it.",

Only 3 of them were out of stock due to an event that happened the day before. My dad had a pretzel and told me it was excellent with their mustard pairing. We had great service, very friendly personable staff. Phenomenal guest Taps. Their own brews were really good. I particularly liked Old Boy brown ale and Ugly Sweater Milk stout. I definitely recommend stopping by since their beer roster is always changing. Something for everyone.",

And I must say this place never disappoints. It was an amazing experience. The beer was incredibly delicious (as always) and the atmosphere (good music too) was super friendly and inviting. The staff at 33 are always extremely helpful and knowledgeable, always going out of their way to make sure I enjoy my time and have a good time. I would highly recommend stopping in for a pint or two if youre ever near the area as its a really great establishment. The outdoor seating is also awesome and a great way to enjoy a sunny day.

From the way the beer packaging lines up when flipped either way, to the perfect branding on their coffee cups, to the clothing that they have made in Vancouver it s all done well to make a clean and awesome package. That image then meshes well with the products they offer which is crafted with the same purpose. The beer is great, the food is top notch for breweries, and the coffee is good (my preference would be for a little bit stronger of an espresso).

Highly recommend this place and would suggest you try any (and if possible, ALL their pizzas). 10/10, would recommend.",

They also have a delicious cider and occasionally have non-alcoholic kombucha available for people who aren t so into booze. They offer a few small snacks but also often have a food truck parked outside and allow you to bring in theirs goodies. Plus they have a dog tie up outside and lots of windows so you can sip on your brew and peep on your dog at the same time.",

We were meeting my hubby at Red Truck Beer.  My brother drove me and when we rolled into the parking lot I didnt expect its where craft beer is brewed.  My hubby did the ordering as he was there first with garlic fries and wings. You need to order at the counter and pay first.  Youll get a number to take to your table which helps the server to bring your order to the correct table. I had the Fish Sandwich which had beer battered cod, lettuce, tomatoe and siriracha mayo with side salad (gotta had something healthy right?) :). It was a large sandwich and flavourful.  With the crunch from the beer battered cod and freshness from vegetables this was a great start to a weekend. My brothers ordered Smoke Brisket Sandwich and Sante Fe Eggs so I cant really comment other than they enjoyed their meal. Great times at Red Truck Beer!  I cant have alcohol but still had a great time at Red Truck Beer!",

Its a large space which means you have more of a chance of finding a space, the decor inside and out is very in keeping with the name of the brewery and the cool old school trucks help with this vibe. There is wheelchair accessible entrance and also a disabled toilet on the main floor. The menu is quite varied but I have to say if you are looking for something healthy you will definitely struggle, even their salads arent amazingly healthy with creamy dressings etc. However, if your looking for a roadside truck stop classic this is the place! The beer is great and they always have tons of variety and seasonal specials, most of the staff are friendly and all of them are knowledgeable about the beer. Go make a pit stop there!",

I have been here prepandemic and currently but I keep going back for their food and friendly service. With COVID they have such a clear entry exit setup and all the tables are well distanced. Their fries are so good whether you get the poutine or chili cheese ones or my favourite ones; I DEFINITELY recommend the buffalo fries with blue cheese! Aint nothing hit the spot like one of those!",

No blame..dude looked a bit beat up.  The other service staff. Seemed in charge,  red braids, into it attitude got us back on the road though.   Burgers wer pretty standard..fresh and tasty. Fries were salted to a perfect charm. The baja lager was served cold and was super enjoyable.  The mac and cheese is a good option from the sides menu.  Theres a certain ingredient that is unique to the dish amd makes a good pair with the beer i had.  Food came quickly after we ordered and was the proper temperature..side sauces i ordered were full and plenty for our portions.  Would take a bro friend (beer flights looked interesting) or a girl that doesnt need a whole lit of doting and likes to eat.  The bathrooms here are a total experience i didnt see the womens naturally but the mens was custums sinks and faucets and all dark stained wood..a+ and with the theme.  5 stars for the redirect with service staff and great food ..fully loaded burger for under 20 is nice... would recommend/go back to try more beer and have the mac and cheese again.  The menu was full of options...but i stuck to basic bacon cheese  burg.  Totally filling and prepared well.",

Not for people seeking line and fine dining, but if youre into Microbreweries this is an excellent choice.  Good beer and service.  Great patio.",

The fries were hot, crispy and tasty - I salt and pepper them to my taste. This brewery is right off of the Central Greenaway bike route and has a couple of bike racks for locking up. I will definitely consider returning and recommend to others.",

Tell me a place that has all 3, I ll be waiting oh and free parking nearby. . . The Hawaiian pizza is my go to here - chunks of pineapple and drizzled with jalapeno cream. It is beyond heavenly   we tried the meat pizza for the first time during our pizza and lemme tell you - IT IS loaded with meat. They definitely didn t skimp out on the topping. . . As for their drinks, the pink lemonade is my go to, I ve also tried their other lemon mandarin racket before but found it abit to sour for my liking. Go and soak up some  before we get our 9 months of rain again . . Shout out to the staff for being so accommodating with the dogs! Their bowls were constantly refilled with water",

How good is pizza made at a brewery, you may ask? Id say in contention with Via Tevere for best pizza in town. The pizza+beer combo is heavenly - you gotta experience it for yourself.",

I love pizza from the states and I ve had a hard time finding anything in Vancouver that compares to the pizza I ve had in New York and places like that but this place is by far the best pizza to come close to American pizza. Nice thin crust amazing flavours stringy hot cheese just insanely good I was blown away!! Not to mention the homemade dips they make in house! You have to try their homemade ranch it s amazing !! Highly recommend this place!",

I went to jupider. Had to order another round of the stuffed dates they were just THAT GOOD. Please... I beg the chef to never remove these from the menu... They are THAT good! Thank you for the epic taste bud experience, Strathcona!",

And I saved the best for last, all beers are $5! Exactly the way it should be! So many breweries especially on the n shore are charging waaaay too much. Bridge Brewing 10/10!",

Recently I was at the brewery and a person ahead of me in line commented that for beer, you can t beat Bridge. I wholeheartedly agreed with him. The All Out Stout is a phenomenal beer, I m glad it is back. The NSP and Bourbon Blood Orange are exceptional. It s worth going back regularly to taste new creations and rediscover old favourites...I ve discovered so many different kinds of beers like Gose and Saison (looking forward to the return of lemon gin). The specialty beers around Christmas are so good, too- I look forward to the Grinch and Santa s Sac. The people are super friendly and always greet you with a smile.

Happy Hour ~ I had the mac and cheese that was amazing. -Perfect balance between rich cheese flavors and a satisfyingly gooey texture.   Pairing this delightful dish with a flight of craft beers is a match made in heaven. -The server knew we had a long day and just wanted to talk, so they made sure we had our space to talk without interrupting. The inside was a lot bigger than I thought and had an outside patio as well. -Would come back and recommend though I do wish their happy hour served more options or a bit of later happy hour window.",

There s cool art hanging around for sale and amazing (rock) music. Saltys the lobster shack is the restaurant portion of this brewery and the lobster rolls are AMAZING. We ordered a grilled cheese, a Maine (cold) lobster roll full order and a half order lobster roll with bisque that came with a huge chunk of lobster! Everything was delicious albeit a tad salty but thats okay, I just drank more beer ;) Beers here were pretty good! I tried the jasmine rice beer (same one sold at the Lunch Lady, a highly recommended Vietnamese restaurant on Commercial) which was very light, and also the Hef. Would try their pale ale next time when we re back! Saltys had last call just before 8pm on Sunday but the brewery still serves snacks (like sausages) afterwards so just a heads up! Will definitely come back!",

The IPA beer was the best out of my 4 flight.  Not a fan of the honey brown ale.  Support our local breweries!",

The food was delicious, service was excellent and went the extra mile with an issue that happened after I had left the premises. I was presented the incorrect bill unbeknownst to me, most likely due to a staff shift change. Which I absent mindedly paid without verifying since it was an E-bill via a tablet. I did reflect on it later after seeing the bank confirmation sms, but didnt bring it up with East Van. They actually had noticed it later also and had already issued a refund which I got on Friday. I never brought it to their attention, they went ahead and did the right thing. Thats honest, top tier service right there! The gesture was very much appreciated!",

The beers here seem not those fruity flavoured brews or ultra hoppy IPAs...plenty of places already serve that demand well. Here, what they have are excellent (what I would term) traditional ales...not as hoppy, darker brews. And theyre really, really good: the kind of flavours youre likely to taste in the UK (though obviously served at North American temperatures....sigh). Though I live in Port Moody, walking distance from brewers row EVB is my go to place to fill the growlers. The vibe here is great: down a few steps (theres a handy elevator for those less mobile) and with a few mates it definitely reminded me of some bars in London....sink a few pints*, grab a snack and sit down for a few hours of banter. My only issue are the pints (hence the *). I really hope that EVB move to using proper pint glasses instead of what I think are more like sleeves. Every time I grab a beer Im thinking I REALLY wish youd serve me a proper pint and not this short measure #nomoreshortpints Otherwise, well worth a visit. Take your empty growlers and fill up too.",

They have a food truck onsite serving a mix of burgers and snacks. Their hazy ipa has some nice fruity flavors and goes down easily.  Their normal ipa is a little darker with a nice malty flavor.  I would have liked a little hoppier profile but overall it is a solid contender. The chicken sandwich (burger) is great although everyone on my group was not a fan of the fries.  They were pretty greasy and had an odd spice on them but other than that the food was pretty solid pub style grub. We stayed for a few hours and there was a consistent flow of people coming in.  It never really got too busy and the lineup for beer was always short and moved quickly.  There were lots of locals coming in for growler fills and grabbing some cans to go as well as popping in for one or two quick drinks. This is also a nice family friendly place and their were quite a few people with their kids throughout the day.  Along with kid friendly, they are pet friendly and there were a few different pooches laying under the tables. The outdoor seating area was spread out nicely and had enough room to not feel cramped whilst ill having a close friendly feel.  The patio has an east exposure so make sure to get there early if you want to catch some rays on the deck.",

The tap was cold as many craftees serve cool  beer but cold is what we want! PLUS, Full Pouring, not the low pour/bighead nonsense  that permeates so many establishments in Vancouver!  Take your money and taste buds to Black Kettle, they appreciate  you worked hard to earn it.  Go there first! (oh yeah,  they accept cash still!!!)",

Their beer is fantastic, they have an option to order food via their food truck outside which is very well priced and good quality. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the other customers usually spark up conversation so its a fun place to be. North Van has some amazing micro breweries but this place has blown me away. Highly recommend you check it out!",

I loved the tasting room and sampled several of their beers, leaving me satisfied. I also bought some glassware to take home, and I use it often. I want to revisit this brewery as they update the tap quite often. Thanks for the great experience, Superflux!",

There s also lots of plants for the indoor houseplant lover to gaze at (check out their gigantic birds of paradise!). They have gourmet hotdogs ($13+) if you re hungry and happy hour beer+hotdog combos on weekdays. Fave beer is the Jellystone; hazy IPA, a tinge of sweetness, so easy to drink. Also bought the canned Pretty Much Yeah to drink at home and didn t love it as much. Superflux Lager is super easy to drink. Also had Happyness, a West Coast IPA. Definitely recommend the Jellystone if hazy is your thing.",

But I digress. Its all about the beer. I had the Jellystone, which was very juicy, almost like a pineapple juice. But a very fresh and refreshing summer drink. Loads of flavour and goes down easy. Low on the bitters, even palatable for a non-beer drinker. Same goes for the Colour and Shape, which my wife ordered. I felt that one was slightly more muted than the Jellystone, and closer to a summer beer. Very enjoyable. The vibe of the place was very chill. Dog friendly, and great service.

Their tasting room in Vancouver and restaurant (Cabana) in Victoria are incredible, offering quality food and beverage, a beautiful atmosphere, and knowledge staff. Highly recommended.",

It s a bunch of individuals with their own brands and they re all amazing in their own right. - Beer is spectacular. If you rank Vancouver as a beer destination on the world stage, a significant contributor to that ranking is attributed to the S-tier grade that Superflux deserves - Food is otherworldly. You simply cannot go wrong: if you showed up hungry and didn t leave sated, you messed up. - The music. Whomever is choosing the playlists  needs to win an award. It s all the deep cuts. All the nostalgic hits. All the things. - If you happen to come in when Dennis is around, a standard 10/10 Superflux visit gets a rare 11/10 grade because Dennis is one of the best humans in the city. Summary: Come for the beer. Stay for the bangin  playlist. Revel in just how darned great each and every personality attached to Flux is.",

Superflux has been around for years, originally brewing out of Strathcona, a few blocks away. Their bread and butter offering is hazy IPA. In my opinion, they can do no wrong. The only things I haven t liked are their take on a stout, cream soda, and coconuts IPA. Otherwise their repertoire of NE IPA & NW IPA are great. Collabs, great! They did a Pilsner with four winds, also great! Diablo cookie inspired collab with Tacofino, you guessed it... also great! Looking forward to the tasting room, but for now I m super happy to have a HUGE supply of their rotating favourites in the neighbourhood. Check them out!",

Loved their hazy ipas (velvetone, color & shape, pretty much yeah). Like the 3 different pour sizes. They do not offer flights. - service: 4.5 stars. Staff was friendly, responsive, actively kept our alcoholic and non-alcoholic glasses full. We experienced one minor, negative incident while waiting outside however, hence not 5 stars. There was no queue and their covid info signage (outside) instructed to come inside if there is no line, so we did. But one staff member asked us to then go outside and asked us to  read the sign , as he thought this was mentioned in the signage. He repeated the quoted statement twice which I felt was condescending and unnecessary. Then I pointed out to him that the instructions are different from what he said, which he then accepted and apologized. - ambiance: 5 stars. Decoration was minimal, nice, and clean. Lot of seating. Restroom was clean. - parking: no dedicated spots that we could locate but street parking available. - covid measures: good, staff wore mask, had sanitization stations.",

Our whole group was impressed! Karaoke night is not usually a draw for me but the staff made it fun and we ll all be back! Great job Dogwood! A hidden gem off the beaten brewery path but they certainly left the attitude on the other side of town.",

Being a realtor I got Nash Moving recommended to me by another realtor. Then I tried them on my clients first and my clients were extremely happy with their service. Then we hired guys for our own move. The guys are working  so hard and so fast and we didnt have a  scratch neither on our furniture nor on any walls. They gave us over 40 large packing bins for packing (returnable), so we didnt need to get any boxes.They wrapped everything and they were working like machines. Yet, their prices are more than reasonable based on quality of their job and the timing. I always recommend Nash Moving to my clients for moving and to my friends and other realtors as well. Next time we move, Nash Moving is our to go company. Way to go guys! You definitely changed the way this industry works! Have you heard of people tipping movers before? Neither did I :)) And we sure did! These guys do amazing job and fully deserve to be tipped. Thats how great they are! We recommend Nash Moving for your next move!",

Nash Moving handled it all with ease, even making a last minute schedule change with no complaint!  The took great care of our belongings, securely packed, wrapped, padded and protected everything, and put it all back together in our new home.  They came ahead of time and quoted me on the move, were very competitive with their pricing, and they charged EXACTLY what they quoted.

They were very easy to work with, provided a quote over the phone after a virtual consultation that was super convenient, there were no hidden costs and they were by far the most affordable option I found.  The moving day was smooth, they worked well with the building security on both sides to accommodate covid elevator requirements etc and were friendly as fast. The dissembled and reassembled my large furniture and packed and unpacked my closets in minutes using wardrobe boxes.  Working with Nash saved me a ton of time and stress. I highly recommend, and told me realtor to refer his clients as well because my experience was so positive!",

They were super quick and careful with everything, had a good sense of humor and were  also very respectful. The move was also quick and easy. The boxes they packed everything in make it so much easier to move and unpack too. They left the boxes for 1 month so we could have time to unpack, which was very convenient! Overall, a great experience and would recommend them to anyone!! Service: Moving-related packing",

A friend of mine heard about their expertise and professionalism and mentioned them to me. Everything was shrink-wrapped and moved very carefully asking me where I wanted each piece upon arrival. One doesnt expect a mover to show personal kindness and thoughtfulness if you are having a particularly bad day. It was due to these unforeseen circumstances that I had to phone Nate and ask if he could possibly move more items on a day during which he had hoped to just relax. Nate and company are the best and most likeable movers I have ever used and Im now a senior! Nate is not only more than obliging he is compassionate too. It is perhaps this part of his personality that is as valuable as his moving expertise. I have never been in even a remotely similar personal situation before but Nates kindness made such a difference in my day. Thank you so very much Nate! Just in case any readers might think this is a marriage separation or problem within causing my grief please know that this was not the situation. I will be recommending Nash Moving Ltd. to everyone I know when they need a professional, reliable mover in every way! They do not come any better!",

They were always reliable, were careful with all our furniture and belongings, and pleasant and courteous. We loved the blue boxes they supplied, used their services to pack our most fragile kitchen and dining room items, and   were very pleased in all aspects of both moves. Nate was very accommodating when we found out on short notice that we could book an elevator for our new place. While we paid for our storage monthly, the second part of the move to our new place was included in our original quote to move us once into the condo directly. The flexibility and full service options were perfect for our situation. Highly recommended.",

But moving with NASH was the first time where we found ourselves ahead of schedule, drinking coffee (since we didnt need to help at all), and laughing. Seriously - the NASH team was having a good time and telling jokes, and my husband and I actually LAUGHED! Thats a huge testament to the difference with using NASH versus the other companies weve used in the past, where our stress levels were above maximum (and there was no sipping coffee or enjoying a good joke). I always recommend NASH and plan to never do another move without them. Theyre fun, fast, efficient and so strong that I dont have to worry about being helpful as a 52 person. They gave us moving containers in advance, disassembled all our furniture for us, and then reassembled it upon arrival. We were fully moved into our place and unpacked within a week, thanks to all the awesome help and perfect moving strategies. Thank you so much!!",

The sandwiches Ive had seem like the bread is stale. Wraps are good, but could have more in them. Boxed salads are okay. Seared salmon / chicken is my favourite go-to there. Comes with quinoa and a tasty dressing. Actually went in today at ten minutes to 12 to get a lunch. There was already someone waiting at the till when I entered. After looking around, I chose what I wanted and went to the till as well. Nobody was there to serve us!  Several staff were in the back cooking and prepping things, but they didnt acknowledge us or come to the front to man the till. I was in a rush, so I just put the food back and left. Not sure when Ill be returning since there are a lot of other choices around. Peqishs main business is catering, and that fact certainly showed today. When the staff are there at the front, they are nice and friendly.",

Today I got a Festive Chicken Crancherry sandwich, which once again only tasted of onion. Even on the list of ingredients it mentioned a touch of aioli, but didnt mention the many chunks of raw red onion that appeared in the sandwich. Hope that doesnt mess up people with allergies... Very not impressed. Want a nice sandwich made with local ingredients but want to be able to taste the ingredients I purchased the sandwich for, not the ones not even mentioned on the ingredients list.",

Also, theres barely anything inside (equivalent amount of fish that may be on one piece of nigiri sushi for example, thats it for inside the whole sandwich, meat/fish almost non-existent), just mostly the bread, mayo and some lettuce. It looked questionable, but was hopeful there was more to it than met the eye. After a couple bites I realized it was a let down. Not even worth half the price. I showed the staff, only a couple bites in, and explained my dissatisfaction, and no refund was offered.... Update, to address the response from Peqish: I am not interested in ever eating here again, not even for free.",

Without the MetroCentrex communications technology, our travel agency could not assist clients from hundreds of cities. The costs are many times less than having multiple independent contracts with telephone companies. MetroCentrex consolidates everything using your existing computers and mobile devices. You have a single point of contact when new lines and services are needed anywhere in the world. Billing and services are consolidated, and requests are dealt with promptly. The MetroCentrex service is tailored to your specific needs. We started very small, and Metrocentrex allowed us to grow one line and country at a time.

He told us that since we had a pending office move, our old system was adequate to suit our needs. We appreciated the fair and honest feedback. Now, two years later, we have a shiny new system. Again, Shailesh has trained us on how to use and manage the new system, always being totally reliable and quick to respond to questions. We are very happy with the service from Metro Communications.

(Packed a 2700-sq feet, 4-person house in 3-4 hours!)  For this most recent move, we also used their unpacking service, and man was I impressed!  The team was very thoughtful in where they put things and asked questions when they thought I may have a preference (since kitchen placement is so personal!). I especially appreciated how they removed all the boxes (from BBX moving), cardboard, and paper and put them in the carport, so the house felt ready to live in when they were done. So amazing!  (BBX Moving came and removed ALL the boxes and cardboard and trash the next day). Limor herself is always responsive, patient, and extremely pleasant to deal with. In the few times that I ve worked with her, I  always get a sense that she works very hard, takes pride in her work, and has a very strong work ethic. All in all, I would not hesitate to recommend them. Worth every penny!!",

Limor and her team are amazing at what they do, and they provide courteous, caring service throughout. They come in with a plan, they hussle, and they get it done right! You won t go wrong in hiring them. We began with an on-site consultation where Limor walked through the house, took notes, asked questions about priorities, and provided suggestions on how to proceed. We decided to utilize her team for packing as well as some unpacking services. I am so very glad we did. It was critically important for us that we minimize the chaos of the move for Dad. He has memory issues that make any change to his environment frustrating and confusing for him. Limor proposed that we split packing across two days and leave the key pieces like Dad s bedroom and his tv room for the last moment. Also, they photographed Dad s space and when unpacking they essentially recreated it in our new place so that he immediately felt at home. It was brilliant! I wish I had taken photos of the boxes they packed so you could see the attention to detail in their work. We did not lose a single piece to breakage, and we had around 200 boxes of goods being moved. Everything was labelled and colour coded. And their art inventory service is such a great idea, I highly recommend taking advantage of that too. I m not going to tell you it was cheap because frankly it wasn t. But let s get real here: we hired trained professionals to provide a skilled service that supported our move and made our lives so much easier. I can tell you with absolute conviction that it was money very well spent, and we received excellent value for our investment.",

My new place was all unpacked and ready within two hours. No cardboard boxes to recycle, no tape, wrapping paper. All was taken care of as they bring their own plastic containers which were picked up right away. Stress free worth gold decision. So glad I worked with this company.

For her its about setting the customer up for success instead of just providing a service. There have been many times where the two of us have had conversations prior the the pack/move days for a client and formulated a plan to ensure we dont get into each others way and also ensure that the customer is taken care of when it comes to packing, moving, and unpacking. This allows us to deliver a great experience and continue to serve our local community together :)",

They required nothing from me except for a quick walk through before they began (to make sure they knew where everything was and mark items that I didnt want them to pack) and after they were done (to make sure everything I wanted to be packed was packed). They were extremely nice and polite, and not only did they do an amazing job, but they also did it so quietly that I was actually able to work the entire time they were there. All of the boxes were labeled, so we knew whats where, and because they knew we would be moving the boxes ourselves, they made sure to pack in a way so no box was overly heavy. Moving is a tiring and stressful experience. Especially for people who work full time and dont have the luxury of taking their time. Do yourself a favour and let Limor and her staff take care of the packing for you. You will not regret it. I know we definitely will next time we move too!",

We were moving from a townhouse in downtown Vancouver to an apartment nearby with absolutely no time to do anything other than call someone.  We did our homework and lined up three moving companies to come in, take a look, and provide estimates including packing and unpacking.  Vancouver In The Box wasn t the cheapest, but they were the only ones that we had full confidence in and in the end it was obvious exactly where the extra money was going - it was worth every penny.  Theresa in particular was simply the most professional and impressive person we have ever worked with in all of our lives.  We threw her quite a few curve balls and she hit all of them out of the park with ease.  Moving is usually very stressful, and it was so nice to have someone constantly stepping up and saying  I ve got this.   We re now recommending them to everyone we meet, and that includes you.

Their email response (10 minutes after my initial email) calmed me down immediately and they came two days later. Now listen to this. They packed my whole 1500 sqft townhouse that was completely full including a garage completely full of stuff (borderline hoarder status) ALL BEFORE LUNCH TIME!!

We can t charge you  double  simply because we don t have surprises, as we estimate each client personally and send an accurate invoice accordingly.

Our IT company has been working with ForeSeeson for a number of years now and all of our Fortinet purchases and renewals go through this company. They offer competitive pricing, and our rep Austin is beyond amazing. He is very responsive, offers good information on how to navigate renewals or end of life appliances, and makes sure that things get done when we send in requests. We cant be happier with our experience of ForeSeeson and would recommend using them to anyone who asks. Thanks for all the help ForeSeeson and of course Austin :o)",

                "review_text": "PRE- REVIEW I have entered in the ZAP BC program.  I feel the way the program is set up their might be some room for speculation. They are offering a  level two charge-point charger to anyone who applies. They are in charge of the installation though. Seeing as I already have the required NEMA 6-50 plug installed with the correct wiring and breaker I should have a pretty quick application review time. I just got off the phone with the gentleman in charge of the program. He assured me that the program is set up on a first come first serve basis and all applicants are treated in such order and not based on the money they are going to make off of the installation. Im sure I can just plug in the charger (No installation required) *****************  Will update as soon as I hear back ******************** I received a quote for the charger and installation.  The price was somewhat reasonable. To certify the charger they have an electrician come install it on the wall. The price is a little high for those of us that are already wired up but worth upgrading your charger for this price. I would like to see this program amended in the future to benefit people that are already wired up. No need for the program to require an electrician to visit your house if you are already wired with a 240V 40 amp circuit. So...   in closing the program seems legit, and if you are not wired up this program is definitely a good way to get a LEVEL 2 charger and circuit put in. I only did this to support the EV programs and to upgrade my 16 amp charger to a 32 amp charger. (I have a volt so both chargers will charge in the same amount of time) but, in the future who knows if ill benefit from more amperage. Hope this helps  all interested in the ZAPBC program. If I have any problems with the installer I will add to this review. Steve Carey",

I paid almost $5,000 and invested over 30 hours of my time to try and trouble shoot issues with both Foreseeson and Chargepoint. The list of errors created by this installer and Chargepoint included: 1. faulty hardware equipment on two occasions; 2. over two months of failed software trouble shooting; 3. one occasion of incorrect electrical settings by Chargepoint; 4. over 15 occurrences of Charepoint staff that could not help address charging issues. Although the final result is a working charger, the road to this point was a circus of errors and tail chasing. If you are looking to install, I would encourage you away from Foreseeson Technology and Chargepoint. I have had a very negative experience and would not recommend either company. Best wishes in your search.",

                "review_text": "Chris and team took over the site from an early botched attempt at a landscape installation on my 15,000 sqft property -- new construction and they were late in the game towards competition, we had to GO. It was still ground zero landscape wise, but even the landscape architecture was flawed and not what I wanted to achieve. We had to start over. While I had the tone, feeling, vibe and texture I wanted, the details were outside my scope, I had no idea how to get this done. Chris leaned in, created ideas and concepts from the words I had to share, partnered with a designer for even more input and we executed -- GCLC executed. They crushed the installation. Heavy equipment everywhere, dirt flying, landscape going down and yet, every single day they left the site, immaculate. Contractors dont work this way, ever. GCLC does. There is pride in every job that you rarely see, in each day, in how they show up, how they leave and if issues arise, pride in how they work to solve those issues. It was beautiful. It is beautiful. Since then, GCLC has continued on with me for 4 years -- weekly maintenance, snow removal in the winter (and they literally sing together, while moving snow in the cold! ...when the people are happy, the work done is always better, huge cheers to the culture this company has been able to create, its impressive). Each spring, we always find the next project to build on the overall theme. The maintenance team cares, as if its their house... and weve found, dare I say friendship! Its great to see them each week, always hustling, grabbing my input as they go. New tree, new garden bed? New drainage problem that came out of nowhere from an ever changing landscape? Lets never stop building GCLC -- you will always be my landscape team.",

From their first visit we could see a difference and tenants commented about the improvement.  Whenever I had a concern, it was addressed timely and professionally.  They have gone beyond and I am very impressed with their services.  I would not hesitate to recommend them and they certainly have my business for any future buildings the company acquires.",

Instead of driving away he went looking for the owner of the vehicle to take responsibility. The owner of GCL made it so easy for us to have it fixed. After having a bad experience with another company, we thought we would give GCL a chance. If you have employees that are responsible for their actions like Luke, you must be a great company to hire! We were right, these guys did a great job. They weren t cheap, but you can t buy a Ferrari for the price of a Honda. Two guys came and worked hard all day and got our job done (garden and our lawn). They were worth every penny. We will recommend them to anyone that asks, and we will be using them every year! Thank you GCL, you guys are awesome!",

For years we fantasized about transforming our back yard from moss/ant infested concrete pavers with an uninspiring rock garden perimeter to an inspired eating and living space complete with cosy fireplace and easy to maintain yet beautiful landscaping. Choosing companies is mostly a random exercise so from the moment we initially met to discuss the plans, until the project was complete, it was nothing short of spectacular. Of importance, is that everyone who worked on the project offered many suggestions and solutions that ultimately added value to the final outcome. Plus the project was completed on time and on budget and everyone was professional, friendly and went beyond what was expected. Save yourself the agonizing search for a company that will meet all your expectations and choose Great Canadian Landscaping. Sandi Yang",

Our previous company over salted and killed a number of our garden plants as well as an expensive hedge. As well their attention to snow clearing was lacking at best. I was constantly out clearing our walkways and the city sidewalks that where our legal responsibility. GCLC uses IceMelt, a pet safe product, and a much more careful and thoughtful application that seems to not affect our plants as much, AND the gold star, the snow clearing is down to the concrete. Our sidewalks are clearer than our neighbours! The areas around entrances, recycling and garbage areas are thoroughly cleared making me worry less for my older neighbours whom the slippery conditions are a hazard. Thank you GCLC!

I tried it with plain nachos. The taste reminded me more of hummus - which Im not mad about. It was really hard to stop eating it hehe. Then, I tried it on a warm croissant - which reminded me of a cream cheese taste - just a little bit more acidic than a regular cream cheese. Which is also not a bad thing in my opinion. All in all, I love it!",

I purchased two charcuterie packages to share at small gatherings this Chrismas season and it blew everyone away. Words alone cannot express how delicious it is.

Spread Ems chef is always coming up with new offerings like olive oil and herb marinated vegan soft cheeses and a Philly-style cream cheeze that quickly became my new favourite (it is divine on sourdough toast with sliced tomato and cucumber).

The flavours worked perfectly together and it turned out to be my favourite!  I savoured every last bit of it and though its long gone now, and not available where I live, I still think about how lovely it was and how wrong I was to think I wouldnt like it. The cheese Im speaking of is the Apricot, Chili and Basil one! Please dont ever discontinue this cheese.  My son has instructions to buy  more of your cheeses, that one in particular, whenever he comes to visit and I asked a few friends to look for it if they are in a place that might have it.  Alas, nothing yet, but I dream about slathering your lovely cheese on a piece of fresh baked bread some day soon I hope. Thank you so much for creating such fabulous products.

I am not remotely vegan or plant based - I *enthusiastically* eat meat and cheese - and I enthusiastically eat this stuff! The garlic and chive flavour tastes just like Boursin - you cant tell the difference. I was a bit reluctant to try some of the flavours (carrot chilli...?) but I have yet to be disappointed. Some spreads are sharp and tangy, some are smooth and a bit sweet, all are very flavourful and beautifully balanced. You can find them in many smaller grocery stores, but if you find them at the farmers market you pay $18 for three tubs - a huge savings over what youd pay in a store. And if you dont think youll finish them all (you will) they freeze beautifully. I cant say enough about these spreads. Go eat them now!",

                "review_text": "@ Tom Brown, Well, you have to consider the fact that you LIVE in an 8 story building that only HAS one elevator. Maybe also consider the fact that elderly and handicapped people are living in the top floors of a single elevator unit. Fact is, over 50% of all these buildings have never modernized their elevators, and all parts required have not been produced for over 20 years. Ever heard the term passing the buck? Thats what your building owners are doing. Yup, when older elevators go down...they STAY down for a long time...and there are plenty of reasons why. All parts come from the states and Europe, and since American Homeland Security prohibits any dropships to Canada for large companies such as Otis...your parts turn from overnight delivery to several days at best. Then consider that Otis has to deal with hundreds and hundreds of these out-of-date elevators where parts are non-existant and incorporate how many tech crews are available to get to the time-critical ones. Then consider the fact that all mechanics are unionized and work at their own pace. So you asked why doesnt Otis work the wknds?...maybe direct your question to LOCAL 82 and ask them why. Its horrible to be without an elevator...YES, but you have toss the blame where it really lies...and thats with building owners who dont want to pay the money to bring their units into the current century.",

They never show up to fix it when they say there going too and the people they do send dont look or act professional in and way. and reading all the past reviews in not sure how this company is still in business. SO BUYERS BEWARE DO NOT BUY FROM OTIS!!!! Ive lived in apartments for over 10 years and never had any issues until I moved here and now in a year 4 times its been broken in one building and even more if u include the other buildings in the complex.",

(That is, we have had no elevator for over a month now.)  Our building manager has been unable to get any news from Otis.  Initially, we were told it would take about a week to fix it.  Then another week.  Then Otis said they would come on Monday, and simply didnt show up for a week.  They evidently dont work on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays. here are elderly people in the building who are missing their doctors appointments, and who dont like being unable to go out for over a month.  I have phoned Otis Canada a few times, but have never been able to get any information.  My wife has cancelled 8 physiotherapy appointments. (so far!)  Now the long weekend is coming up (Labour Day), people would like to move out. One person wanted to move out 2 weeks ago.  He cant, because theres no elevator.  I find it extremely odd that Otis will not work for double or triple overtime or whatever.  I have sent the main office (not the Vancouver office) 3 emails, which they cannot be bothered to acknowledge, it seems; there is not even an automated reply.  I phoned the Vancouver office just now - put on hold, and then transferred to a different number, which didnt answer.  I phoned the Vancouver office again, and there was no answer.  We have had no information at all from Otis for about 2 weeks now. Its incredible, really - there are about 60 apartments in this building, and no one knows when the elevator will be repaired, or even if it will be repaired ever.",

Clearly the almighty dollar is the only thing that drives this company. Their stuff is proprietary and they wont let anyone else service the elevator programming, give me a break. Welcome to the 21st century Otis ownership, Too Big, Too Fat, old guys in leadership not aware of how this could play for them online we have a voice!!! I hear Richmond elevator is eating them alive with customer service and fair pricing. Merry Christmas to the ownership.

When I pressed the call button right away they told me someone would be there to help me right away. 45 minutes later I called again and they told me that someone was on their way and should be there soon. An hour later I was still stuck in the elevator with my 2 small children and had to call the fire department to come and help me. I happened to walk by our front door later and FINALLY saw OTIS come.... 2 HOURS AFTER I CALLED! Im sorry but what urgency did they have? Absolutely ridiculous.",

Heather was extremely helpful as well. I wanted to get this finished as quickly as possible. Tarlan sent the final email and then I received the email from Addel with the confirmation shipment. KLO Portfolios did an exceptional job and I would order portfolios with them in the near future for my other works. I highly recommend them. I received my portfolio two days in advance and it looked extremely professional and high quality. Its beyond 5 stars. Thank you so much!",

I wanted something sturdy & not flimsy! I am so impressed. I received my portfolio today & couldn t be happier. Mine is Acrylic Matte in Black with engraving & color fill. But they have different material options, like aluminum or veneer if you don t like acrylic, they have tons of different engraving  options with or without color. The customer service is amazing! You send them your file and they work with you to get it perfect. Also the website is very user friendly. The best part: every portfolio includes overnight shipping, once it s done in production. Below is the  cover  I haven t put my prints in yet. No filters #supportsmallbusinesses",

I had to get a portfolio to graduate this May with a Advertising & Graphic Design Degree, and wanted to make a bold statement. My professor recommended Klo, as well as one of my friends. The process was super easy to set the file up for whatever finish you were getting (die-cut, engrave, etc.). Klo kept in touch, and usually answered back to keep you notified about the process. All I can say is, I cant wait to show it off at interviews, and even portfolio reviews. Worth every penny!",

And this comes from someone who was very nervous and anxious about ordering. But from the very beginning to the end result I wouldnt have changed a thing and will probably revisit them in the future! The team at Klo is so supportive. I probably called quite a few times asking multiple questions about the process, how it works, which book would be best, etc. and they never hesitated to answer my questions. They always made me feel so confident and secure about my book with constant emails about the process and if there were to be any changes made, which I really appreciated a lot. And it so happened my book was engraved instead of a die-cut which worked out so much better! And they made sure to run everything by me first and send my proofs. They were always very professional and friendly. Willing to help accommodate any of my needs. Words cannot describe how AMAZING my book came out. So much better then what I imagined!! So sleek and professional! Packaged perfectly and so cute and personalized with my name all over the wrapping which definitely made me feel special. When I bought it to class, so many students feel in love with it and were blown away! They even decided to go with Klo for their books after seeing mine. Every job interview I have been on has said amazing things about my portfolio. It really leaves an impression. At my portfolio show, Im not kidding jaws dropped. I cannot express how awesome Klo is. From the every aspect they are with you and for you. I love them so very much!!! So please i recommend them so highly to you! And if this helps, I just got a graphic design job and lets just say my book stuck their attention ;) Thank you Klo for your exceptional work!",

I felt confident when I submitted my portfolio design. Shortly after, I received a phone call reviewing my submission. It was apparent that they were in the best interest of the final product being flawless by suggesting and explaining size adjustments to improve my design. Timing was as promised and quality surpassed my expectations.

Yes, the price can be a bit steep for those who might be on a student budget, but were talking about custom crafted work and it is worth every cent. In my line of business, as a graphic designer, a printed portfolio is still an important piece of the puzzle and one of the challenges you face is standing out. Klo solves that. I received nothing but praise for the quality of my portfolio during my portfolio show and it helped make me stand out greatly. Needless to say, I am ecstatic about how it looks. The service, management, and every part in between was also on point. They got back to me in a timely manner, made things very clear, and above all actually made the process feel human with actual customer interaction. I honestly dont know what problems could honestly occur when that kind of treatment is being applied. I am still in aw of the work that was done and how efficient it was. Not to mention the amount of padding that went into keeping this thing safe was astronomical. They also did the printing for all my pages within the portfolio and that too was top quality. Ive had many printers send me prints that came out completely off point but Klo got it done right. Nothing but praise for these guys. If you have the budget and need to stand out, I highly recommend getting Klo to do your portfolio. They are second to none and I have yet to see portfolio crafters like them anyway, especially not online. If I ever need another portfolio done, I am easily coming back, not to mention Im recommending them to everyone at my school to get it done here. Thanks again for all the hard work guys! It was a blast working with you. Regards, Brendan Mudryk of Tyr Designs",

My professor told me that they were good but too expensive and that there were other places MUCH better and cheaper. I checked every place he gave me and even look on Etsy and was NOT close to Klo. The most important part was that they take it so serious. Everything is from scratch, so they know what they are doing! I called beforehand and gave them might ideas and my logo and what I envisioned and they literally made come to life!! On top of that, my book/table was named the best one on my portfolio show. I got incredible comments from so many people!  I was so happy with my book. Ill be ordering a, Ill be making a photo book this time!",

Approximately a week before my ship date I e-mailed and asked if I could pay shipping to get weekend delivery so I could have my portfolio prior to my trip. I was told that I could and said I wanted to, but never received a confirmation or request for pament. I then called and left messages and received no response. I finally got ahold of someone and was told that early shipping never got added to my order and that it might be too late, but they would find out and call/e-mail me back. I never received a call or e-mail. I left for my trip and arranged for a coworker to pick up my shipment on Monday (my original ship date) so he could bring it for me and it had still not arrived, so I was not able to get my portfolio in time for my trip which is the entire reason I had ordered it in the first place. I do not know if my portfolio is good or not as I havent seen it, but I would not recommend Klo Portfolios simply based on the poor customer service I received.",

Our custom portfolios are cut, treated, and assembled in house so they do take some time to create.  Your proof was approved on October 15th and our turnaround is 2 weeks in hand from the time your proof is approved. We originally wanted to offer you a weekend delivery service as per your request and later realized and let you know it wasnt available so we shipped your custom portfolio on Friday with a complimentary upgrade to an express service you were not charged for, a $68 fee we covered for you. Unfortunately your package was held at US customs which we dont have any control of (I wish we did!) so it arrived one date after your requested date. We do our best to accommodate all deadlines even if its needed faster than our 2 week turnaround stated on our website.  You received a complimentary express shipping  upgrade in hopes youd receive it earlier for your trip and Im sorry you didnt receive it in time. Please give us a ring if youd like to chat further.

We note on our website that all of our leather will have natural blemishes as this is the very nature of leather. We understand that mistakes happen although this is not one of them.  Please allow for the vegetable tan leather to take its course and patina, which will add beauty and character to your portfolio book and case.",

The selection available at this store is one of the best selections I have come across in my trips to many other local canning suppliers. The staff here is always knowledgeable, polite and most of all...helpful. I recently attended this business and noticed some new signage. I feel it is very important for all businesses to have the same approach as Wells Can has had to the mandating of vaccines/masks policy. I wear a mask, and that is my choice. Some people choose not to, and that is also OKAY. Thank you for being open minded, and supportive of my freedoms as a Canadian Citizen! I will go out of my way to come here from now on.",

Unmasked employees didnt even stay 6 ft away from us, even though we clearly took many steps back when they entered out personal bubble. We felt extremely dissapointed and disrespected. We will not be returning and have already contacted Burnaby bylaw. We will make the slightly longer drive to Pinnacle Distributors from now on, since theyre service has always been amazing!",

I phoned and got a quote on some bee keeping equipment and was given a quote , I then increased the order amount and was given a better price based on the amount. I placed the order and when I got the invoice (which was after the shipment) it was more than quoted. After a couple phone calls and emails I was told that was the new pricing  and I was quoted on last years prices and nothing could be done. They took over from another company that gave very good service , not the same now.  They didnt even offer to meet half way .  Hope they dont treat all customers like this ? Murray",

I found the description of their face mask to be promising more than what the product actually was. When I contacted them to try to find a win win solution without having to write a negative review, I found their customer service really disappointing.  To me if felt like they were more focused on trying to avoid responsibility for the issues rather than focusing on serving their customers. Their face mask was also on the more expensive end of the range.  If they had delivered well I would have had no problem paying that price, but it ended up just adding to my disappointment. I wish this company the best of luck in improving the experience of future customers.  We are all human and a work in progress after all. :)",

                "review_text": "**DID NOT RECEIVE REFUND UNTIL AFTER I FOLLOWED UP, OVER A MONTH AFTER ITEMS WERE DELIVERED BACK TO HERSCHEL** I ordered several things for Christmas. Upon arrival, I was very disappointed in 3 of the 5 items and returned. The return process was a hassle. I had to  request  a return, wait several days for a response, then pay return shipping. I did not anticipate having to pay return shipping although I acknowledge I did not check prior to ordering. I sent the items back 2/13/23, tracking shows they were received back to Herschel on 2/15/23. As of 3/19/23, over a month later, I d not heard a word from Herschel. No acknowledgement of receiving my return, no refund, nothing. I reached out to Herschel via email and immediately rec d a canned response email saying the company was very busy, it would take several days to hear back from them, and to consider their chat. I went to the chat and had to provide the order and return authorization number, and tracking number for the package that I paid to return. After proving that the package was signed for by someone named Gabby at Herschel, the refund was issued almost instantly. Of course the shipping was not included. There was no explanation of why my money had not been returned, and I AM POSITIVE MY MONEY WOULD  HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO ME IF I D NOT GONE TO HERSCHEL. At the end of the chat I asked why I hadn t received my refund without having to proactively reach out to the company? The response from Herschel chat was  No worries- the warehouse is really busy . No worries ?? Clearly on Herschel s end, but the chat person as a representative of Herschel certainly seemed tone deaf to what I was saying. It was a worry for me, that s why I ve been waiting for over a month. It s my money, and I worry about it! It s clear Herschel does not, so  no worries  I won t be ordering from your company again",

                "review_text": "I placed an order 2520751 and received the backpack yesterday and had my four year-old try it on. Unfortunately, the backpack is too big for her, both straps fell off the edge of her shoulders. Therefore, I called Herschel Supply Roberson and asked if I could bring the backpack back there for a return. The staff told me no because this backpack is the sale item. I am quite surprised and upset for this reason: When I purchased the backpack, a 30-day return policy was listed below. There was not a pop-up window that told me I can not return the sale item. Besides that, the reason I bought this backpack is not because of the sale, it is because my four year-old daughter loves the butterfly pattern. I checked the size for the current Herschel backpack I have at home for my six-year-old daughter. The measurement fits the dimension that is described for a mid-value backpack on the website. But they are actually different sizes, which I realized after I received the butterfly mid-value backpack. I didnt know there are so many different sizes apart from XL and mini. This is also my first time purchasing Herschel online. I am quite disappointed with online Herschel. I thought I would return this butterfly backpack and purchase another one online from Herschel. But I also learned today that heritage kid backpacks do not have inside laptop sleeves and a side packet for carrying a water bottle. By contrast, Indigo offered the Herschel backpacks which have all those features that I mentioned above. In the end, I had to purchase another Herschel backpack for my four-year-old daughter from Indigo where they also do not have a no sale item return policy and they have all the features that I am looking for for a kids backpack. I talked to the store and they asked me to call customer service where they never answer the phone and Llivechat staff named James did not respond me back after I tried to explain my order, Indeed, he just closed the livechat!!!!!!! I will never buy Herschel again! Moms, please not waste your time on a company that does not want to serve their customers! The $50 dollar backpack is a lesson for me to learn!!!! Hope my post can help someone at least.",

So I sent the email requested for cancel and I even received the reponse email but It shipped the next day.The problem was that I need to pay for the return fee so I ended up going to the store to returned the bag. And now Im still waiting for the one that ordered. I cannot even cancel because they can not guaranteed. How can you do business like this This is so frustrating.

I came across FoodPak by total coincidence when a truck with their logo on it drove past me on the highway last summer. I had just been discussing the issues we were having around sourcing the sustainable packaging we had hoped to use for our new products, when I turned and saw the FoodPak advertising right there on the truck in the lane beside me. That was the beginning of what has been the most positive and professional experience we have had as new entrepreneurs on this journey. Nick was so informative and patient with our high maintenance requests, and went above and beyond with sourcing and creating the perfect packaging to fit the vision of our brand.  He listened, then communicated his plan, and then executed on that plan on budget and ahead of schedule.  We are already excited about what we can create with FoodPak in the future and are so grateful for the outstanding customer service and product we received.  Thank you!",

Upon seeing the collaborative finished design I was impressed with the quality of work and the attention to detail.  For instance, a little hook was welded to the tank near the mast to hold the bar that swivels the mast.  This was not requested but was a nice touch. For travel across the ocean they arrived rather quickly, installation wasnt too complicated, cooling system was plumbed and we were up and running.

Every piece of a equipment is checked and double checked to ensure the best quality product, prior to shipping. These checks do include welds. At Prettech Canada we pride ourselves on the quality of the product we provide to our customers. Stout is a well known company and a solid competitor for smaller equipment. I am very glad that they were able to take care of your business needs. Stout Tanks and Kettles has a great reputation. Stout does ship from China. I think that every American and Canadian business would love to have North American based assembly. Given that you love your new tanks, you can see that outsourced assembly does not inherently indicate poor quality. It does however allow companies like Stout Tanks and Kettles to offer prices that are more reasonable for a business such as yours. When we last spoke, I was not aware that your complaint included welding issues. Please feel free to reach out to me directly to address your concerns in more detail. Happy Brewing!",

Our company did a warranty repair for Mike in 2017 and still have not been paid for our work, despite numerous attempts to collect. Buyer beware - this company owes us over $6,000.00 and refuses to pay. As a reply to your reply: You hired us 3 years ago in 2017. This is when we did the work. We were never paid for that work. The cost of the repair was communicated throughout the process, it was inside the tank on an outlet in a very difficult to get to spot. We needed to chase the crack because each time we attempted to repair, it would spider out further. We brought in NDT testing (after you approved it) to confirm that the repair was good. We travelled to Cold Lake twice (290+KM one way) to complete this repair. We have been out of pocket for the testing, the materials required, travel and the labor for 3 years. We have attempted to collect. Asking for photos of an obscure and hard to get at part of a tank we have already repaired is unwarranted. Ask the client. His tank did not leak after the repair.",

The tank that had the 2 inch specialty weld done on it. The value of the tank was $5200 dollars the 2 inch fix was $6000 I believe Prettech Asia asked for photos and they werent provided and the client Prettech Asia had trouble justifying there *exorbitant bill*.

The wire maybe covered by drywall after but they take there time to tie them up and organize them. They don t leave a maze of wire they hide them making it hard for a nail to accidentally hit anything. Would recommend them to anyone looking for quality work. Great crew with amazing knowledge.

Repel was extremely patient with them and walked them through the different options and price points, creating multiple quotes along the way. The repel team communicated very well with our contractors even though they were extremely hard to deal with. We worked mostly with Alvin and Erik who were very friendly and knowledgable. They ended up also suggesting and installing a beautiful smart TV and sound bar in the living room and also installing our door bell system. The best part is they were able to connect all our devices to a single remote making everything extremely easy to use. My parents love their TVs and were extremely satisfied with Repels services!

Alvin, the owner, was very professional, knowledgeable, responsive, personable, and accommodating. He came on-site several times - something few companies do. They work VERY hard for you. One time, the painter ruined the HDMI cable, so Repel brought a new one - except it was defective, so they stayed a couple hours until Alvins brother brought a replacement and retested everything before they left. It was so easy to just leave a new cable without doing anything, but these guys do everything with diligence. We got their home monitoring install + service, security camera package, low voltage (TV/telephone/internet) install, home theatre package, central vacuum, water bug, you name it. Repel offers competitor top tier monitoring service package for a price cheaper than the competitors basic price! Weve used their products for 3 months now, and the only issue I had was with the security cameras. The manufacturer is from China and partially state-owned so Im a bit paranoid about installing their app on my phone. And weve had a couple of connectivity issues on the monitor. HOWEVER, it does the job so I cant complain. If you are deciding between Repel and another company, always, always, always choose Repel. Save yourself some trouble, time, and money.",

Nick did all the rough in and was great to deal with and would call when he was unsure about something.  Alex comes in and does the finishing and was very capable at the job.  Would highly recommend.",

I was in a bind as a purchased a treadmill and .. yes they did say it was curbside drop off but I was in a panic when I realized how big and heavy it was when it arrived! I was going to get a buddy to install it but I decided to use First Lion when I saw how massive it was! I contacted them and they came to my rescue with very short notice the next day. They brought the treadmill in and set it up for me quickly and efficiently. I have to say that they were so calm and professional I was SO IMPRESSSED and I felt so confident in their skills and knowledge. i HIGHLY recommend First Lion as they were truly exceptional ! If you need an installation DO NOT HESITATE!",

                "review_text": "Bought a large wall unit for TV from Ikea, they put us in touch with Task Rabbit as their recommended installers. After several phone calls, emails, texts it became apparent that they new less than nothing about installing a wall unit or anything else for that matter. Although we were told they were professionals, the installer asked what tools he needed and if we would help him put it up. Not sure, but thought that was what we were paying him for to install and know what tools to bring. It became very obvious that we were gong to be in for a terrible experience so cancelled and started searching for an alternative. I found First Lion online and thank you to all that have sent in their experiences and expressed their satisfaction because it was from those reviews that convinced me to go with First Lion. Spoke with Gabriel and was impressed with the very pertinent questions he asked, obviously knew what he was doing. My experience: nothing short of absolute satisfaction. Extremely professional, knowledgeable, polite, hard working, perfect install. I expected to be pleased but was actually amazed. They are the only install company to use, bar none. More costly than Task Rabbit maybe, but worth every penny and more. They said they would arrive at 10am, they arrived at 9:50 and were working by 10. They finished at about 3 and although I asked them to take a break they politely declined and kept working. Gabriel and Brent were just two great hard working guys and deserve to get the kind of reviews that are listed here. Do yourself a favour and skip the stress of a poor install and just get First Lion to do it right the first time and sit back and enjoy. Cant say enough about them, really, awesome company.",

Not only did these guys get the job done flawlessly, but they completed our office so quickly that we were able to save money with their reasonable hourly rate. We were quoted a flat rate by another company but decided to go with First Lion instead and we are happy we did because we now realize that the other company had quoted us an inflated flat rate.

He returned my call within minutes, was extremely professional and pleasant, came the same day, and assembled a really heavy, bulky, complicated piece of Ikea furniture in two hours - all by himself when the instructions had said you needed two people.  The hourly rate is the same or lower than the others and without all the hidden fees.  He was so great that when I needed some handyman work done, I called Gabriel without hesitation.  Once again, he was tremendously kind and professional.  I think the second job I gave him was even more difficult than the first yet he did it graciously and with a big smile for a really, really good price.  Gabriel embodies what the tradespeople of a bygone era were like - incredibly service oriented, punctual, professional, completely trustworthy, honest, hard-working, and very highly skilled. As an aside, as a single woman, I am very careful about who I let into my home.  I had no hesitation about Gabriel and in fact when I had to step out for a few minutes he was even thoughtful enough to say Ill keep your house safe while youre gone .   Hire Gabriel.  He will give you the very best, highest-quality, most professional service for the best price.  He is the real deal.",

Due to poor weather, I was concerned about our move date, but received a call beforehand assuring me that everything was still a go. Our furniture was handled with care, and the team even helped us with some of our more delicate pieces; pictures and my bike. The quote given was quite reasonable, and the job was done in a matter of a couple hours. It saved me the huge headache of arranging people and vehicles to help. They will definitely be called in the future; should I ever need to move again.",

Having had such a great experience with them in Vancouver (at our home and 2 business locations), it made sense to have them take care of our Whistler place. I am amazed by how much convenience and piece of mind they have given me. Provident has called us when our water sensors went off.  I know that we dodged a huge bullet (a friend didnt know about a slow leaking pipe in their place and it cost them over $100,000 and almost a year in renovations). Provident has also let me into my own place (when I left my keys in Vancouver).  This saved my family and I over 4 hours of travelling time. Provident - you rock",

With the alarm ringing, the thief was in and out in 2 minutes and Provident arrived 1 minute later (i.e., in 3 minutes!) They definitely saved us from a robbery of much greater magnitude. Provident personnel could not have done a better job  - from providing accurate and reassuring details in the initial phone call to us, to greeting us with empathy when we arrived at the house, boarding up the broken window and even cleaning up mud and glass from the interior of the house.  They walked us through what had happened and gave us tips to prevent further break-ins. These two Provident employees really helped offset our distress at being broken into and definitely exemplified the high standards advertised at Provident.  We cannot recommend them more highly.",

The hicup was the delay of the new roof installation on the facility.  As a result Tarum had to work closely with the roofing contractor to make sure his installation met the warranty requirements.  I have to say that Vancouver Solar did an exceptional job of doing quality work despite the obstacles.  Tarum took care of all permits & dealing with BC Hydro to join its grid.  He made sure that the job was done right.  We are pleased with the finished product & would highly recommend Vancouver Solar.",

Our roof has many segments and some skylights, which added complexity, but the installation was done well and looks very clean. There are no visible wires on the roof although the system has 9 separate panel locations. Tarum the owner made the whole process easy including the permit application and the setup for net metering with hydro. He was happy to give me detailed explanations on the types of solar, we went with optimizers and an inverter, and answered many questions of mine. We re now 2 months in and the system is working really well. We ve had no issues and the app is easy to use. I m so happy to see our credits at BC Hydro building up this summer for when we need it in the winter. In the end I cannot recommend Vancouver Solar enough. Great job guys!",

Tarum was EXCEPTIONAL - and so thoughtful, patient and willing to share. He was flexible with system set up, thoughtful about our needs and utterly reliable. He was super careful with our roof, and handled all the paperwork with the city. I would absolutely recommend him! Exceptional experience and were THRILLED with our system!! It was affordable, designed well and brilliantly completed. I also waited for a windstorm before posting my review - just to be certain!",

We contacted some other companies, but Tarum was the most professional in explaining our options and had competitive pricing. Tarum took care of all the ordering, permits and schedules, and worked with our builder for the installation.  He also contacted BC-Hydro to setup the net-metering account. It was a hassle-free and smooth process. As we were the first solar in our area, Tarum had to spend a day tutoring to the electrical inspectors how the solar system worked. We now have 44 solar panels installed on our roofs along with a battery backup system and it has been working great.",

But did give me general price without too much details. And never got back to me on the cost of addition solar pannels. The 2nd company quoted me $25,000 for one Teslas Powerwall. After supplying them with pictures and diagrams of my exisiting system. But did not visit me to see my requirements. Only VSE quoted me and visiting my site and told me the addition requirements need to meet the current code. So after getting an engineers report (extra $), an upgrade to a 200 AMP electric service panel two handle my two electric cars ($5200) plus $1400 to the power company to disconnect the power on request, (blackouts are for free, and on the Sunday we had to change our clocks, we had four extra practices due to power backouts for about 10 minutes each, there was a major wind storm that day). The extra solar panels were installed within a month of contracting. But we waited three months for the transfer switch (Telsas Gateway) to arrive, but never came. So we had to disconnect two circuits to make room in the 100 amp panel for the solar power. The addition solar give me a total of 12.5 KWatts. During the summer months we had a large credit with the power company after the hotest summer on record and all the power we used for the AC. And was not until fourteen months later due to supply chain managment problems that the battieres came and were installed. During the installation of the solar panels, VSE did extra free not solar work for me. By installing a mounting bracket on the side of the roof. Saving me from hanging upside down over the edge of the roof 10 meters above the ground. We shall monitor our power usage and needs here to see if we may get a third powerwall in the future. In our home we have two adults working from home online, one going to school online, two RADAR stations (24 hrs/day), HF/VHF/UHF/SHF radio station, and emergency Internet. So our power requirements are unique that other companies would of gotten the business if they came over for a site inspection. VSE was the only company to do that and give a detail quote, and a report of the payback. Therefore VSE got the business. The Covid19 and supply chain management delays had nothing to do with VSE. Therefore I would recommend VSE for your power and Solar needs.",

However, when I described my project to him, it didnt seem like he was listening and at some point, actually pulled out his phone.  Perhaps he was not impressed by our small project and saw no value in continuing the conversation. Anyways, we took our project elsewhere, somewhere which seems to place more value into it, regardless of the size of our project.",

Could you remind me what your company is and what you came to us looking for? I would be the first to admit that we do suggest to some people who talk to us that we are not a perfect fit when it either makes more sense to hire someone internally or go with an individual rather than an integrated engineering team, but I dont recall ever turning someone away without a good explanation of why it might more sense to take a different strategy. Many other firms may be more likely to take on the work even if it isnt the best move for the client. Are you sure it was our company that you talked to? Again, Im sorry that we did not get a chance to work together and I hope that you have been successful with your venture. Best regards, Josh Usher",

Through our research, the valued referral and after meeting with Laddie, we were convinced he would have our backs with regard to our home security and he and his staff did and continue to do so with exemplary representation. Laddie has tremendous technical knowledge, never stumped for a solution and vast up to date product information to always present to us best options. He provided and continues to provide us with step by step explanations of accessing systems/equipment, advised best options, price differentials, set up, etc. and virtually walks us through every aspect of our home alarm system, security cameras and fire protection. This constituted and still involves much time, effort, site and home visits and patience from Laddie and his staff to afford us this education and experience. Often we have had questions or concerns on a weekend and Laddie always responds and has surprisingly shown up at any time of day including evenings, Saturdays and Sundays to assist us. We believe this speaks volumes in addressing his character and the commitment of him and his company in providing an excellent service. We believe that reading reviews substantiates your evidence in the due diligence process, so we realize this and do not hesitate in recommending Laddie and Innova Security Systems. We are confident that it would be a challenge to find a better company for your home security needs.",

I am happy to say, everything was executed in timely fashion and everyone in my family was properly trained on home automation hardware that was installed.

We have exclusively used Toshiba products which work particularly well with our windows/Mac blended environment. I had nothing but issues with my enterprise level HP MFP because it would not get along with MacOs. The Steelhead team offers fast and thorough tech support. Many things are diagnosed and dealt with by phone and failing that someone is always available for s site visit. The sales team is thoughtful and interested in delivering the best and most cost effective solution. We dont need to think about our printing, copying or scanning needs because Steelhead always has us covered.",

Let me tell you that if you want bad support, try companies like An.. or Col.... where you cant even get someone to answer the phone.  We switched to Steelhead about a year ago.  Average wait time to get someone to answer the phone - none.  (Im not even going to tell you what the other places were like - and another nameless equipment place asked me to do something illegal - seriously).  Steelhead is either able to remote in or walk us through a problem in about 10-15 minutes or they have someone onsite in about 4 hours, which is critical in tax time.  One time with one of the competitors we had to buy a small printer from Staples because they were going to be days to fix a problem.  Days.  In tax season.  Really!  My office manager has just told me were never switching because she can at least talk with a person at Steelhead.  They have been patient with us and we so appreciate that we arent a big customer, but they dont treat us like a small one.",

The employees have worked hard for the company for nearly three months and have not made any mistakes. There is no problem with their ability to work. They can find any reason to fire employees. They only take advantage of legal loopholes. During the three-month probation period, employees can be fired without reason. Its legal, its very unfair to us workers, a regulation is not a good company! Its best not to go again and change to a more humane unit! No wonder their company keeps recruiting newcomers to try out and then dismiss them, a vicious circle! Very contempt disgusting! There is one more disgusting thing. Before entering the company, you have to have a medical examination and buy iron-toed shoes. We need to spend at least 50 for the physical examination to check for tuberculosis and get the report signed, etc., and 80 for the iron-toed shoe market. Their family paid 40 physical examinations and 70 iron-toed shoes for reimbursement. However, the reimbursement will only be granted after the probationary period has passed. So the decision is entirely in their hands. You did not make a mistake, if they want to fire you, they will fire you. And they wont reimburse you, and they will confidently say that the contract says that they will be reimbursed after the probationary period. What a shameless unit!",

In essence, we wanted to wow our developer client and also provide a wonderful representation of the project for prospective buyers and realtors to appreciate the realism of actually being inside of one of the townhouse units, through our project website, brochures and at our Presentation Centres. Our results with Stambol have been amazing. Their 3D, 360, AR, and VR work for us has exceeded all expectations. Never before have we been able to offer such high quality true to life images and renderings for a pre construction offering. Our client, prospective buyers and realtors have all been wowed and we are very happy with the work Stambol has done. The team at Stambol has been awesome to work with and dedicated to ensure client satisfaction. Stambol is a great partner for us and we look forward to collaborating with them with our future development projects.  We would greatly recommend Stambol Studios for anyone looking to do 3D, 360, AR and VR  in their respective industry. Nevin Low, Executive Vice President Nu Stream Marketing Inc.",

Stambol created VR tours of several of our home types and we are using this cutting edge technology in our sales centre to help help customers see our home plans in three dimensions. This is a game-changing technology and it offers so much more than traditional 2D drawings. Dogu from Stambol has offered us exceptional service and a great deal of advice and guidance as this is relatively new technology and can be intimidating to many.

                "review_text": "I had the most horrifying experience with this company today at the ESI spa show here in Vancouver. It was quite busy at the show with many woman in front of me at their booth looking at their lovely things they had to showcase and sell. It included their stuffed animals (warm buddies) , cozy robes and other warming bottles. Everyone was touching and feeling and when it was my turn I asked the woman how much the teddy bears were. She replied in a very rude tone  they re all a different price . Ok well how much is this one I asked, I would like to buy it for my daughter. $20 dollars! She said rudely and so I handed it to my daughter and went to get my wallet when she said  give me that one back or pay for it first if you want to see anything else, nobody wants to buy one that a child has touched . I was so shocked! So shocked. And so were the other women (whom I didn t know). They all put the items down that they were looking at it. And one woman said that s the rudest thing someone could ve said. Especially a salesperson trying to sell their product! A child s product ! I was not only embarrassed and mortified about the situation, but my daughter was so upset when I told her I m sorry we aren t going to buy this anymore. 15 minutes later when I was walking around a woman from a different booth approached me and said she was so sorry for what that woman said to me and my daughter. It was so extremely rude and unprofessional. They really should not have this woman representing their company. ( she was wearing a lime green long sleeve underneath her black vest with short hair)  Hopefully the owner reads this and addresses this issue so it never happens again to anyone else. I can t imagine anyone wanting to support a company like this. I know I can t. EDIT: Thank Karen for replying to me. I do accept your apology and I can understand that it was quite busy and probably would ve added to your probably stressful day. I was just really wanting to buy a warm buddy for my daughter. Thank you so very much for your offer of sending her a warm buddy, she will be so happy about this.",

I was attempting to find a Warm Buddy for your daughter as you said you were not sure which one she would like. That is what I understood. I was in the process of bringing choices for your daughter to see. What was going on at the same time was a customer wanting a Warm Buddy that had not been handled. Normally I would have allowed your daughter to keep the labrador she had while I brought more options. I wanted to explain what happened as I did realize that you were not happy. This show can get very busy and I am sorry that you left without our resolving the situation. I am the owner of the company who you referred to and this situation is not what my company is about.  It is always my intention to have happy customers and for everybody to have access to our products. I would be very happy to send your daughter a Warm Buddy as that is what my intention was at the time. Warm Buddy options can be seen on our website. Kindly accept my apology as there seems to have been a misunderstanding which caused stress for you. Please contact us at info@warmbuddy.com with a product choice and shipping address, I will be very happy to send you a Warm Buddy for your daughter. Again, please accept my sincere apologies for the unfortunate experience. Warmest regards, Karen",

I have seen the inner workings of a lot of consulting companies, and HHT is genuinely in a league of its own. It all comes down to excellence, inclusiveness, and fun. First, excellence. This is a company that seeks out unique, challenging work that most other EE companies can t handle. This is a sharp, elite team that is brought in on complex projects where human lives are at risk and safety is paramount. This can be seen in their projects - roller coasters, deep-sea submarines, and more. Second, inclusiveness. Diversity is good, but it s really inclusiveness that matters. I saw how deeply this runs in HHT s DNA. On my last day in the office and at the end of a successful project, I wanted to pick up a few bottles of champagne for the team. I mentioned this to the president, Mike, and he kindly mentioned,  don t forget to pick up some de-alcoholized bubbles, too.  I had completely overlooked the fact that there were team members that do not drink. It was absolutely front-of-mind for Mike that everyone gets to be included. And speaking of fun, there is a reason you see so many smiles on LinkedIn and Twitter posts. Be it games of Coup at lunch, team events, monthly food culture events, or Friday runs to the DL Chicken Shack, there is a welcoming nature to this team that puts a smile on your face plus they can solve the really challenging problems.",

Technical language and systems were explained in a clear manner for someone without their background to grasp. CodeTactic ensured to understand my history, goals, and overall vision of what I needed my website to communicate. They took the time to ask all the questions necessary to ensure that we were always on the same page. Anytime I had questions and issues with anything they were quick to reply and provide solutions. The end result is CodeTactic delivered on what they promised. I loved what they created. They have built me a website that I am proud to own. The website is an accurate reflection of the high quality of my business. Their customer service continues to be quick, accurate, and helpful whenever I have a question with my site. I would highly recommend CodeTactic to anyone who is searching for a company to take care of such an important part of their business goals! Yohannes Petros Founder/Owner - Hanes Hummus",

Coming to the Richmond office is a treat, and I get to see all the people I Hip Chat, Skype, and VOIP to regularly.  It is a very nice and very big and bright office.

Their communication throughout the process was great. They kept me updated on the progress and promptly responded to any questions or concerns I had. I was also impressed by the quality of the materials used. The boxes not only look amazing but also feel sturdy and well-constructed.

I had a lot of things on my wish list, and a lot of questions. I met with several vendors, and each one was different, but ADS was the only one where I was happy with the price, the service, and willingness to work with me to get everything exactly as I wanted it. Others would say no one does that, its not possible. ADS would say, interesting, let me get back to you! And they always got back to me, and they almost always had a solution. If it really was impossible, they helped me understand why. Of all the things I did for my house, making my home smart had the most details to work out. ADS helped me work out every last detail exactly as I would want it, with lots of good advice and suggestions. And they are always very responsive to my questions, so I am reassured that if I need anything, theyll be there for me. And I love my smart home! Now, ADS job is done, and I can confidently write this review, that they are awesome. Also, youll soon learn that it is a father-son team, and I love that. Amarjit and Karn are super nice, and they will earn your trust very quickly. It was a big (and expensive) project and I wasnt just going to hand out my trust either, they really earned it with their honest and transparent dealings with me. When youre dealing with a construction/reno project, trust is key to a stress free experience, and youre going to get that wit ADS. (And trust me Ive had my share of horrible experiences!) So now, Im going to hire them to do my automatic blinds. Theyll always have my repeat business.",

I got multiple quotes on the basic features I did not know about.  I received quotes from multiple companies  and I had no understanding of what work was going to be done or the benefits of it. Karn at ADS was patient with me and explained the features and benefits of everything. They created a system that was customized for my family and our budget. Upon completion of the work they have returned for service calls and upgraded my system from remote locations when needed. They are always available to answer questions and help out whenever they can. The best part of it all is Amarjit and Karn Love what they do and are always excited about new systems, and features. They are a pleasure to deal with and I look forward to working on my next project with them.",

They have very high standards in dealing with both their clients/customers and vendors; it s no surprise most of their clients and vendors have been longstanding partners of theirs for years.
