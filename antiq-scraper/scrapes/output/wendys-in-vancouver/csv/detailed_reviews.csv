ALWAYS something... The last time I went to this location, everything was perfect.  The fries were hot, the letus was a sensible size, my burgers were not greasy and were put together properly, there were no onions on the burger, the service was fast and friendly... it seems like a simple thing, but its surprisingly rare.

They finally got my order right on the first time the last time I went, which should be the general expectation when one is waiting for his order, at any given point of time. But in the 6 times in a row previous (I counted), they were getting the orders wrong.  One crew member at first didnt want to get me a side caesar salad because she wasnt trained in making it.  And besides the mistake in giving the wrong orders, some of the right ordered burgers were lacking vegetables that were supposed to be in them. Sometimes I see customers stand around for a very long time, either waiting for their orders or waiting for someone to take their orders.  And it is never even all that overwhelmingly busy with the number of customers that come in.  The kitchen crew would see us all standing there like lumps of cheese, and they couldnt even have the Customer Service sense in sending someone over to the counter to take care of any of us. This place is such a mess, that there were a couple of breakout arguments between crew members and the managers. Wendys Corp, please read our concerns here.

This is a highly tailored, streamlined dining experience.  Personally, I was lucky to get in due to the size of the line.  I might have had to mention I was an influencer *wink wink* on both Yelp! and Instagram (TM). When you enter, ask the matre-d what the chef recommends that day.  During my visit it was the Spicy Chicken Sandwich and I was informed there was a limited run based on available farm-to-table ingredients.  Boy was I lucky - it was prepared fresh by the gifted young chef, Braydon, and promptly brought to me by an extremely professional waiter Ghazal. The plating was impeccable, as if the foil was designed for my personal sandwich itself.  Absolutely to die for.  The sauce must be truffle infused because it was heavenly.  The bun was clearly artisan, I think from a local bakery on Lonsdale.  The tomato had to have been grown that day and I could ABSOLUTELY tell that the chicken used to make the sandwich was the alpha of the roost.  A prime specimen, surely. I cannot say enough positive things about this experience.  I will be returning, that is, if I am lucky enough to get in again *wink wink*!
