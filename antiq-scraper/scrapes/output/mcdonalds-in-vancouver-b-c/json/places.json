Why didnt I just go to the Timmies literally just a few steps away right across the street from the SkyTrain station you ask?  Oh I did.  But sadly at 730am they had no toilet paper in their public washroom.  So, wtg, McDonalds!!; One more runny nose saved.  Thank you.",

You basically select what you one, finish the order, pay by card or get the ticket and pay at the counter. They also do make your own gourmet burger. I was quite skeptical about this, but I must say Im quite impressed with the quality of the burger. The beef patty was juicy and the rest of the ingredients were fresh. Its a bit pricier compared to the usual menu, but totally worth it. I dont generally eat McDonalds but if I do, Id definitely find one that do make your own burger.",

The service is amazing, and staff are on and everything, making sure everything is done efficiently and amazing. I had the quarter pounder and fries, and it was the best McDonalds meal I ever had.

No crumpled and soaking-with-grease buns, no dry patties. Staff are friendly and chill, and the dining area is almost always clean and quiet, even when busy.

We have gotten to know quite a few of the staff. Sure there is turnover of staff but 30 years steady gives one lots of time to get to know alot of new people. Annacis Island has alot of warehousing rather than retail business so clientel is 99% warehouse workers,truck drivers and office staff. So its different in a nice way...lts not that I dont like children or old people..we all will be that ,if we live long enough ,but your not going to see much of them here. So if you want full spectrum of the population go Mcds at Metrotown and youll see what I mean. So no review about the food quality..only the coffee..l love Mcds coffee Haha!  Jim from Vancouver.",

Buffalo worm larvae to be exact. When will McDonalds be taking up this practice? Hopefully sooner than later he says, with a mysterious grin! So sir I ask you this: how many cucumbers go in a big mac? Exactly. Point made. Checkmate. Bingo. Olly olly oxen free. That being said, I love this location. Someday I hope to get married here.",

I got a parking ticket from this McDonalds parking lot while eating at this McDonalds yesterday. I parked the car and went into the store from the main entrance (not the small entrance thats next to the parking lot) because my friend was waiting for me at that door. I tried to dispute the parking ticket with Royal Parkings and explained the situation, even attached my receipt. The appeal department replied and said as long as I left the parking lot Id need to pay for the ticket. I actually walked straight to the restaurant and spent an hour in there with food and drinks from McDonalds, but still need to pay for the ticket just because I went through a different door? This is not the right thing to do to people in my opinion. McDonald s should have a talk to their service providers when they act like a scammer.",

Literally everything within the walls of McDonalds is not healthy. But that s not why I eat here!! I give this place 5 star cuz sometimes  Life is rough. Life is busy. Life only has time for a McMergancy!! Not sure why this place gets such low Google score. This McDonald s location has been a pillar of the community for 50+ years. I come here randomly and honestly consider every experience on par or better than most other locations. The only difference I see sitting in the drive-thru line up is the caliber of the vehicles ahead and behind me.",

There were two homeless people without masks giving the staff and other customers a hard time, and she handled it like a pro. No hate to the homeless, these two were just making everyone feel unsafe. She took care of her staff and her customers and was still courteous to everyone involved. This location really needs its own full-time security personnel. She should not have had to handle that on her own, or wait for mall security to arrive. Given the location of this McDonald s head office really needs to make sure that there is a security guard on the premises at all times to keep the employees safe. Good job to this woman though - I hope y all are paying her properly for what she has to deal with assumingely everyday.",

He was on the serving side and brought my item with a smile. This employee deserves recognition for great customer service.  I will be back again and hope to get this persons name.  Keep up the good work! Edit: The workers name is Daniel.  He was also working at 9:30am on Sunday, October 15th.  Again he provided exceptional guest service.

Despite the small size, this Mc Donald s is located in a small plaza with the tightest parking spots possible. The staff were helpful and friendly although as many have stated, if there s a few people in line you are out the door. There are two self-serve screens inside and a small bathroom on the ground floor. There are also two small tables at the front of the first floor but 5 outdoor tables. There s a sign that says personal reusable cups are encouraged and also a sign outdoors that says outdoor seating is for patrons only. However I saw many sitting here enjoying their non-Mc Donalds lunch. I liked seeing people utilize their outdoor seating and the community feel it brought so bravo for allowing others to sit and use your tables, I really liked seeing this and 5 stars and this review just for that.",

There was a young lady with short blue hair working in the payment window for the drive through.. she was awesome! She was so clear, pleasnt and efficient and something about the way she spoke was quite calming... which was great because I had three kids with me - two of which were arguing and the other one was screaming. I just felt like Id like to give her a little thank you. The food was great.. burger looked like one on the commercials which doesnt happen often in my experience. The kids loved their meals and devoured them.. but what kid doesnt? It was a nice treat for them. Thanks, guys, for saving me the chaos of whipping together a late dinner.",

Unfortunately, the employee gave me some kind of watered down coffee that tasted nothing like it was supposed to. They probably forgot the syrup? I only found out once I got on the bus. I stopped by this location to ask if they could replace it. I was planning to buy a new one if they refused, but was happily surprised when they agreed to simply give me a new one. Great customer service! Thank you :)",

So  we go inside to either eat in or takeout our order is never wrong this way. Very quick and very nice and courteous Employees. Also very busy if you ever watch them from inside? Food is always fresh and hot. if your not happy with the meal, they will give you fresher fries and burgers, or whatever?  you might have to wait a few minutes? but it is worth the wait. My husband and i prefer going inside now rather than the drive through. We recommend this Mcdonalds.",

The downsides are dirty tables and floors, a lot of garbage and an overflowing trash can right next to the tables, which was not very pleasant. We wiped our own table and sat for quite a long time. At the end of our meeting, workers came and removed everything from the trash can. We may have stopped by during their lunch hour, lets try again. But the kitchen itself was clean and the workers were in clean clothes. Well come back again, maybe it will be cleaner.

You will notice people struggling with the door because they are not sure its locked from inside or staff locked it.

I hadnt used the McDs app before, and the girl at the cashier kindly helped me find the right spot to scan for my $1 coffee promo. I was short 5 cents, which was awkward, and she told me it was okay. I mean, this is in a rough area of town and they must deal with all manner of people, but her professionalism and kindness was amazing. I also like this location, because its close to where I live. Ill be going out of my way to order food here when I feel a McDs craving and Ill be paying the kindness forward very soon. Good work, West Pender McDs! :)",

It often feels a little depressing when you walk in the door and you can see it in the staffs demeanor. One day I walked in for a cold dessert and encountered the bubbliest, happiest, the most joyful employee I have ever encountered. Even with her mask on, I can tell she was smiling ear to ear as she took my order. It felt very welcoming and it was a nice change. The way she would communicate with her coworkers, with so much respect and care, showed me that her demeanor is genuine. The amount of joy she was putting out was radiating throughout the place and I picked up on it. I was having a long day (hence why I came in for the dessert) and she totally changed my mood. Justine is going places and making a lot of people happy in the process. If management sees this review please let Justine know how much of a difference she is making at your location. Its not just the food that makes an establishment stand out.",

I used to get breakfast here a couple of times a week and eventually one of the ladies started recognising me and remembering my order and I would usually just have to confirm between two items that I always ordered. I am now working from home so I no longer go there, but I sometimes miss my little routine and receiving great customer service! Previous review: This is one of the worst locations Ive been to in Vancouver.  There are two women here that are part of the morning crew who give the most horrendous service I have ever experienced and one of them is a supervisor/manager. They dont know how to listen and as a result they get my order wrong...often. Theres nothing complicated about ordering a McMuffin without cheese and two hashbrowns. When I order coffee, they get the size or number of creams wrong. This isnt Starbucks and Im not ordering a complicated drink but somehow a simple cup of coffee gets messed up almost every time. They often ring in my order wrong and I have to repeat myself two or three times before they get it right and they like to argue with me as if Im doing something wrong. I speak perfect English and they seem to as well, but clearly their listening skills are lacking.",
