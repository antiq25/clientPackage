Tasty beef patties on a sesame bun  are bad for you! Literally everything within the walls of McDonalds is not healthy. But that s not why I eat here!! I give this place 5 star cuz sometimes  Life is rough. Life is busy. Life only has time for a McMergancy!! Not sure why this place gets such low Google score. This McDonald s location has been a pillar of the community for 50+ years. I come here randomly and honestly consider every experience on par or better than most other locations.

One day I walked in for a cold dessert and encountered the bubbliest, happiest, the most joyful employee I have ever encountered. Even with her mask on, I can tell she was smiling ear to ear as she took my order. It felt very welcoming and it was a nice change. The way she would communicate with her coworkers, with so much respect and care, showed me that her demeanor is genuine. The amount of joy she was putting out was radiating throughout the place and I picked up on it. I was having a long day (hence why I came in for the dessert) and she totally changed my mood. Justine is going places and making a lot of people happy in the process. If management sees this review please let Justine know how much of a difference she is making at your location.

I used to get breakfast here a couple of times a week and eventually one of the ladies started recognising me and remembering my order and I would usually just have to confirm between two items that I always ordered. I am now working from home so I no longer go there, but I sometimes miss my little routine and receiving great customer service! Previous review: This is one of the worst locations Ive been to in Vancouver.  There are two women here that are part of the morning crew who give the most horrendous service I have ever experienced and one of them is a supervisor/manager. They dont know how to listen and as a result they get my order wrong...often. Theres nothing complicated about ordering a McMuffin without cheese and two hashbrowns. When I order coffee, they get the size or number of creams wrong. This isnt Starbucks and Im not ordering a complicated drink but somehow a simple cup of coffee gets messed up almost every time. They often ring in my order wrong and I have to repeat myself two or three times before they get it right and they like to argue with me as if Im doing something wrong. I speak perfect English and they seem to as well, but clearly their listening skills are lacking.",a year ago,2022-11-19 01:49:28.422245,,,,3,48,5,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101378747282788679040/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,
