After shopped there once, I received a handwritten greeting card from Andy. During pandemic, Andy also sent wishing well emails. I could also stay home and buy from him. He was very patiently showing me the products through emails and texts. Andy also checked the products carefully before shipping them to me. You can also buy Gucci mens wear from him too. Strongly recommend!",

So the lady on the call confirmed to write email to the boutique to call me and its been two days no one reached out to me still. So pathetic quality product and above the pathetic customer service. The audacity of this brand I tell you. I recommend Gucci brand to please learn some quality and customer service from  Coach  I bought few bags from them and they have amazing customer service and quality. They even remember my name everytime I walkin and makes me feel welcome and above everything quality of product is just amazing. I will go to the boutique and take my bag and never ever buy gucci again.",

I have visited this gucci store multiple times and her behaviour is always the same. I really hope the store manager gets to know about all this. I felt she is a bit old to work for a customer advisor. honestly speaking her behaviour was not tolerable at all. I am planning to report a file to gucci headquarters.

However, i decided to try out the gucci store in holt renfrew(the main section) and nobody greeted us or even came to help us. They only attended asian customers, even attended an asian man who sat and waited for hisfriend to buy something but not us. This is not acceptable by a store such as gucci. No help and snobbish behaviour! Please take 5 mins and walk to Fairmont Hotel, so much better customer service.",

He made some great personalized suggestions and brought out some fantastic pieces from just a short conversation. Impeccable attention to detail. Lots of laughs, very enjoyable, zero pressure to commit. Five star service. Will definitely look for him next time.",

Next day, I was running late but their engraving specialist waited to talk in person, and stayed back longer than his hours to finalize the customization I wanted. Another day, the manager went out of her way to help me with a parking situation. Very happy with the purchase. Thank you all for making my anniversary gift special. - this location does custom engravings (I was told otherwise by Bloor flagship store) - metered city parking is right in front of the store",
