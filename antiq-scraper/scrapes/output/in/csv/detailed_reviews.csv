ChIJZ0UuanRuhlQRab4hMds18Uo,Seasons in the Park,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsdHFmNFhnEAE,Emily,5,"We had our wedding reception brunch of about 60 people in the Skyline Room at Seasons in the Park restaurant in early August of 2023, and we were blown away by the outstanding service at our wedding! The food was delicious, the portions were generous, and the restaurant was more than happy to accommodate a few of our guests who had dietary restrictions. The service was fast, and the communication with us was incredible. So many of our guests also complimented the excellent service they received during our reception, and we had so many compliments about the beautiful view of Vancouver as well. The servers even went out of their way to ensure that we, the bride and groom, were comfortable and well taken care of during the entire brunch. Even the preplanning was smooth and seamless, and communicating back and forth with Makda about wedding details was an easy process. Many of our guests have commented that this was one of the best weddings theyve been to, and we could not have done it without all the wonderful help provided by Seasons. As a wedding venue, we highly recommend Seasons in the Park! Plus, we felt compared to other wedding venues, that Seasons was quite reasonable, and who can beat that beautiful view of Vancouver, and wonderful setting within Queen Elizabeth Park. Thank you very much Seasons for making our special day so wonderful!",4 days ago,2023-11-18 01:19:33.530325,,,,0,7,10,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108800684572209349198/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

The chicken karahi was a killer and the K2 platter which was a mix of beef and lamb kababs, chicken tikka boti and lamb boti was excellent as well! Naan, which I usually find to be weak areas for many restaurants here, were fresh, good sized and tasted great! When it came to the food, nothing disappointed, except maybe the vegetable pakoras. When good in taste and quantity, they were extremely extremely oily, which according to my wife happens when you dont let the oil heat enough before cooking. As for customer service by Pruthvi and Shadab, it was great, even if the wait time for food was quite long (~30 mins). They likely need more staff on weekend nights when it gets a little more busy than usual. Some areas for improvement that can further boost customer experience are: cleanliness, especially in the bathrooms. They were dirty and stank. Thats not good. Secondly, the ambiance needs a bit of work. It was a little dark. When it comes to dining, I prefer bright environments. However the food was so good, I could not deduct any points for this and still rate the overall experience as 5 stars! P.S the food is a little on the expensive side. It cost us around $35/head...

I dont go very often since its not that close to where I live, but I wish I could keep going back every time. The food tastes so rich, creamy and flavourful that it makes me so happy. Recently, I went with my dad and it was his first time trying the food there..he LOVED it!! He said that it tasted exactly like how it was back home. The waiting time was only around 15 minutes since we were there as soon as it opened. The customer service is friendly and the seating is comfy too. The only light criticism I would have would be that they charge even for a tiny side dish of lettuce, onions or other veggies; but its only around a dollar and other dishes are reasonably priced. I guess it might be because they are a small business right now & inflation is on the rise so I dont mind very much.

So, I thought I would try something different. We had complimentary mini drinks that had mango and some herbs in it. Was reall good and I hope they have it in their menus later. I ordered the Cassava fries and the African Chili Chicken with pili pili sauce. The sides were fries and pili pili corn. I had the Cassava fries with medium spice and it was great. Perfectly fried. I feel it is better than the ones I had at Simbas Grill. Im not sure what pili pili tastes like but the chicken with pili pili tasted really different from the pili pili corn. The sauce for the chicken was delicious. The spice adds up overtime was it wasnt overly spicy. The chicken was moist. The fries were also really crispy and well done. The corn however, were tough and the sauce was different and did not taste as good as the pili pili for the chicken. I had a taste of the Lamb biryani and I felt many Indian places can do the dish better. Im not sure how good their curry is but the 5 stars is for the chili chicken and cassava fries.",2 years ago,2021-11-22 01:19:48.922380,"Thank you Kate we appreciate your feedback and kind words.

This is a fusion between African and Indian food in all of the best ways. We stuck primarily to the African menu, mostly for the meat. The spice blend is fragrant, flavorful, and the type of spicy that has so much flavour you dont really care that your mouth is burning a little...you just want that next bite because its so good (and I dont do spice usually). The boneless ribs were a favorite for our group. I dont give out 5 stars very often, so please dont change anything about your food! We will definitely be back (and ordering in).",2 years ago,2021-11-22 01:19:53.970620,,,,0,122,4,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113331194059604172739/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

Absolutely loved the atmosphere and the owners. Very friendly older couple and their son run this awesome famiky owned cafe. Awesome home cooked breakfast, amazing friendly and relaxed service, and unbelievable atmosphere. When I got there, I was the only one, but I still loved it so much. The old school diner style furniture and music were awesome. I got the pancake with blueberries, sunny side up eggs, and sausage, which were all very good. Loved their old small glass coffee maker and the mugs. The son who was serving was very nice and friendly....he me told me that this place has been around since the 1940s and his parents got this place 15 years ago have been in the business for so long after they retired, wanted to have a slow and small place and now this place is exploded and is crazy busy ...which I find very funny and awesome.

The decision to reserve a table proved to be wise; we were seated almost immediately upon arrival, avoiding the long wait times that had deterred us during a previous attempt to dine here. Dont be fooled by its surprising location or the state of the building (which might seem to some as if it were about to collapse at any moment).  Inside is something you wont find anywhere else in Vancouver! The atmosphere at Northern Cafe is inviting, reflecting its family-run ethos. The menu offers a variety of comfort food options, and we opted for burgers and a side of poutine. The food was exceptional each bite of the burger was a blend of flavors and textures, and the poutine was a delightful mix of crispy fries, cheese, and well-balanced gravy. What stood out, even more, was the service. The staff were attentive and courteous, enhancing the overall dining experience. Its evident why this establishment has garnered such high praise and even topped lists of the best places to eat in Canada. A particularly charming touch was the inclusion of watermelon slices with our meal. It added a refreshing contrast to the hearty fare and demonstrated the restaurants attention to detail. Another delightful aspect was the handwritten reviews by children displayed on the wall, which actually helped us make our menu choices. Northern Cafe lives up to its reputation.

The day I write this review is my first time going, and Ill tell you its a diamond in the rough! The cafe is within a lumber yard, and you are required to climb a narrow flight of stairs before entering the diner itself. Upon entering, the environment is very tight-knit and warm, a trademark of a family owned business. The owners and the waiter were all very friendly and gave us fist bumps after realizing it was our first time there. He was also very friendly and checked up on us from time to time to make sure our experience was a satisfying one. The item Ive ordered was the Northern Deluxe burger, which comes with fries, potato salad, and a slice of watermelon to counter the savory meal. I decided to add 3 dollars for the poutine instead, and im glad I made that decision. When the food came, I was instantly salivating from the gorgeous looks of the burger. When I took my first bite, flavors burst into my mouth, and a party took place. By far, its an amazing burger and something to crave for! (I never craved for a burger/sandwich before) While I was enjoying my burger, one of my friends had a spicy chicken sandwich, which also looked appetizing and is something I must try next on my following visit. The Eggs Benedict and the Cheddar burger my other friends ordered also looked equally appetizing as well! All of the choices look amazing and will be things Ill try out in the future. Overall, even though this place is located within a lumber yard, the food and staff blew my mind away. This will officially be my first 5 star review and to put it in simple terms...

We arrived 7 minutes after opening and within 5 minutes the line was out the door and in the lumber yard. The service is wonderful and the breakfast food is classic greasy spoon diner fare. Important detail when it comes to payment, they only accept local debit cards and Canadian currency. This left us paying via PayPal! It was unexpected yet quite convenient. Love this place!",8 months ago,2023-03-22 01:19:56.096509,"HI Austin, Thank you for taking the time to write this glowing review! So glad you enjoyed the experience and food!

I loved the strange location of it all   a family run restaurant amongst a lumber yard. This place drew in quite the mixed crowd of local enthusiasts/regulars and lunch crew of construction workers and the like. There s something very nostalgic about Northern Cafe and it s this charm that makes for a fun dining experience. I loved that I was able to order Chinese food while my husband ordered western breakfast. This combination serves well in my books and I am glad to have given Northern Cafe a visit. I ll have to go back for the wonton soup as it seemed to be quite the popular dish ordered. I had opted for the potstickers instead (not pictured cause it arrived as the last dish and I forgot to take a pic) but wish I went with the wonton because I didn t think the potstickers were anything special.,5 months ago,2023-06-22 01:19:56.107486,HI Anita Thank you so much for taking the time to write this amazing review.

Inside a Lumberyard!! 5/5 When I saw on google that it had 4.9/5 stars with over 1000 reviews, I HAD to check this place out! It s a family-run lumberyard homestyle cafe and it did not dissapoint.  The service was excellent!  Mom and Pop cooking away in the kitchen and their 2 sons serving tables.  They took the time to chat with me, see where I was from, explain the menu, and tell me a brief history of the diner.  Most things are hand-made (as opposed to from frozen) and it was superb! 1. Pancakes They were light, fluffy, and slightly crispy.  Probably the best pancakes I ve had ever! 5/5 2. The Northern Deluxe Burger It was pretty good!  Not the best burger I ve ever had, but it definitely hit the spot!  My only suggestion would be add a bit more sauce or do something to it to give it that punch.  I added ketchup to mine. 4/5 3. Hand cut fries Technically this was not a dish, it was just a side to the burger.  But these fries were hand cut (as opposed to from frozen), and they were REALLY crispy!  Give it a few minutes to crisp up as opposed to right away when its fresh from the deep fryer. 5/5 4. Potato Salad Again, this was not a dish but a side to the burger.  I don t like potato salad really but this one was REALLY good!! 5/5 5. Potstickers Another hand-made item from mom!  Not the best I ve had but still pretty good and it definitely hit the spot! 4.5 I would DEFINITELY come back here again and again as I want to try their other menu items!

When you get here, if theres a wait, theyll take your name and mobile number to message you when your table is ready. The restaurant building is really old, it oozes character and Im sure there are many interesting stories from the many years its been in operation. Unfortunately the location wont be suitable for some people with disabilities that would struggle with stairs. Service was fantastic, Richard and the rest of the staff are super friendly - this is a very welcoming restaurant. I think the staff are a major reason this restaurant is great. Last but certainly not least, is the food. The choices are great, prices are reasonable, and everything is a classic in its own right. Although the restaurant was busy with some people waiting, it didnt take long to receive our food. We stuck with breakfast and I must say, it was satisfying. For my mom, she asked for eggs over medium and her reaction was, this is the first time a restaurant has made my eggs perfectly.

The owner is very nice to the customers, they care for the food & keep the restaurant very clean. When I enter the dining area, he ask for the vaccine card & check the ID, which means this cafe keeps the proper procedure. This time I ordered the steak & egg breakfast, the steak is rare which I ordered is perfectly cooked, also with the poach eggs and side hollandaise sauce, very tasty. The white toasts and the hash browns are crispy and they also come with a macaroni salad which is yummy too. Compare to the last time I have a deluxe burger which is fabulous, but my wife said the wonton is so so, (the owner told us that he used the best quality pork that s why made the wonton not tender), I understand not every good things come together will be the best.

First, place is located within a wooden storage yard. And decor isnt  anything special but really reflects east side! My sons are huge pancake fans, so always hard finding good tasty, fluffy pancakes at an affordable  price. This place has it. I ordered the Blueberry and Chocolate  Chip pancakes. Both were fluffy and moist. Veggie eggs benny and cheese omelett was also good. I ordered the French  Toast and it was OK. Wished the slice of bread used for the French toast was thicker. Pork sausage was nice and plump and bacon cooked just right. Well  definitely be keeping this place on our list of go to places! Well  try dining in next time. Cost for the 5 dishes was $63. Very affordable compared to other breakfast places where Id be looking at closer to $80.",2 years ago,2021-11-22 01:20:00.387500,"Hi Denny, Thanks for taking the time to write your review!

It had the best reviews and pictures, so I thought wed give it a go. When we arrived we were very confused as it seemed it was inside a lumber yard. But I saw the entrance and we went up. It was so cute and cozy with the big red poofy booth seats. A true diner. Even diner 50s music was playing. We sat down and was greeted by the Raymond who took our order. From the minute we walked in we felt very welcome. Raymond chatted with us and everyone that came in. Jimmy served our food. And also made us feel welcome. He also chatted with us on our way out to make sure we enjoyed our meal and visit. I seriously cant believe I lucked out to find such a diamond in the rough food joint.

As we walked up a set of steep stairs to the 2nd floor with signs all around pointing to the Northern Cafe, situated in the most obscure location amongst lumber suppliers, we were greeted instantly by a very friendly man (presumably the owner) who took time to share the things that make this place special.  And indeed it was. The place is unpretentious and wonky but cozy, the menu offers basic breakfast (eggs, bacon pancakes) and lunch (burgers, poutine) along with some Asian staples (wonton noodle soup, chow mein, curries). Not fancy but just a good solid meal.  What makes it special is that they make their own ground beef patties, pork wontons, shredded potatoes for the hash browns and even the chili sauce is their own.  As if that werent enough, the price is ridiculously reasonable.  Love love the place. Excellent service.

Service was friendly. We got the #1 Special and #5 Cold Cut, as well as a Che 6 Mau drink. I took my order slip and waited outside about five minutes.

Back at the car the joke was East 38th Ave was Banh Mi Saigon s parking lot, seeing all the customers carrying bags of banh mis. You can also eat at the recently put in picnic tables at adjacent Jones Park. The two sandwiches were well packed with proteins and garnish. The bread had a thin crispy crust and was soft inside. The Che 6 Mau time-warped me back to 2am Vietnamese dinners in Chinatown in Toronto. Everything was, pardon my French, friggin  delicious. I will be back to try the other sandwiches and drinks. Tried the Fish Cake Sandwich and Pandan Jelly Dessert (drink). The fish cake had a very mild flavour. It was a nice alternative to the meat options, but for me a banh mi needs to have pate, so I will try the Vietnamese Bacon next. The pandan jelly itself did not have any flavour-I was expecting herbal. So it was more textural, but the mung bean and coconut taste was very good. If I had it again I would ask for mostly mung bean if they would do that.

It wasn t too much of a difference in price but the service was definitely different.  He explained more details about the TV and told us why we should buy the warranty.  I told him that we didn t buy the warranty at Best Buy because they didn t really have anyone that s was experienced enough to sell me the warranty other than telling me what the price was.  So with that said he spent the time with us gave us all the benefits about the TV and explained to us that if we bought the 5 year warranty and didn t use the warranty in 5 years that we would get a store credit to buy anything we wanted in the store. This definitely was a great selling feature and after that experience we bought the TV with the warranty from Rhythm and told him we will pay first and pick up the TV tomorrow as we needed to return the TV we bought from Bestbuy first as we didn t have space.

They unfortunately did not have the TV in stock and we were leaving the next day. George Chaplin went above and beyond what we expected. It did take a few weeks for the TV to come in but George had everything organized for pick up at their Kelowna store. He stayed in communication with us the whole time ensuring the process was as smooth as possible.

They have always given me the best prices - and I do look at other online sites . Seriously if you are looking at audiovisual equipment the only person to talk to is George Chapman . He is incredibly knowledgeable and will tell you what products perform best in each price range . On this occasion he moved mountains to get me what I wanted  - and on time !! He even gave me his personal cell  number if there were problems day or night ! One thing you should know is that if you pay the extra for an extended warranty - You get the money back as an in store credit if you did not use the warranty. I always get the extended warranty these days .

He is very personable, knowledgeable and as honest as they come. First off,  George listened to what I was looking for and made my buying experience very easy, with no regrets. He directed to me what I needed, didnt oversell. In what was a absolute fluke and a rare occurrence, the TV I bought had a small manufacturing issue with the display and I called George up and told him about the issue. George dealt with manufacture right away getting me a replacement TV! When I was at the store getting new TV many store employees stopped by unsolicited and commented on my choice of TV (it was based on Georges recommendation) and true to his word, everyone backed up what George said without prompting... saying they would have made same purchase themselves. No 2nd guessing or buyers remorse.... very happy with purchase, service and now feel I have a trusted contact for my electronic needs without worrying about BS and being oversold or not getting what I need!

A few days later we received a call from George saying that he had found the range we were looking for and further it was in the Lower Mainland and he had secured it for us.  This came totally unexpected  so we were very happy.  George kept in touch with us until the range was delivered and he became an advocate for us when there was a problem with the delivery.

I went in to pickup my laptop the next day, and it came in a brand new original box, which was nice. Knowing that it might probably be convenient to have something to store it if I tuck it inside my closet or bring it out to a coffee shop, I decided to shop for a laptop sleeve before I left. The sleeves they had were not on sale, and Erik checked into the computer anyways to double check. I was going to wait until the price drops before I buy as the sleeve was a little pricey, but Erik offered to ask his manager without hesitation to see if he could offer me a lower price for it, and the manager just came to me and offered me $10 discount! He explained to me the sleeve is a nice brand and of very good quality. It had a compartment and a front pocket with convenient slots, so I decided to buy it.

I had thought this place was permanently erased from my childhood when I had learned that the restaurant on kingsway was shutting its doors forever. I ordered 2 wally burgers and a chocolate milkshake and it had brought back memories of sitting outside of the original restaurant on a summers day on kingsway. I have to admit it was very close to what I had over 10 years ago. The bun was toasted nicely and had a generous amount of sauce. The onions felt like it hasnt changed at all. It still had that strong onion flavor with every bite I took. The seasoning felt pretty close to what I remembered. As for the milkshake, maybe the  old Asian woman that prepared it back then gave me an extra shot of chocolate or icecream, but the shake that was served was perfect enough. The staff are super friendly and the prices are reasonable. This location is located in a strip mall so parking is available and free.

First, a shoutout to front staff and all the frontline workers braving their souls to deal with the public mass and risking their lives during this pandemic. As we continue on with the new normal and unfortunate spike during last week, it is expected that we all want transparency.  Do staff wear masks?  On my day of my order, no.  I was shocked the 2 staff members that I saw  at the back do not wear masks at all.  I understand that people now want to know if staff members are wearing masks or not (especially cooks) so here is your answer.  It doesnt affect my rating though.  But I sincerely would have hoped the cook staff would wear one though.  Also, I hope they would add on another plexiglass  for the front counter so the cashier wont have to be that exposed to outsiders for health and safety reasons. It only has half a side so when she takes your orders, she will still have be on the side with no plexiglass and I felt bad for her.  Again, it all comes back to safety at this day and time and when staff are safe and healthy, we are healthy (and vice versa).  Hopefully, they would move on to online ordering so we can order, pay online and pick up.  Otherwise, you will have to order in-person and take out.  The wait for your food isnt long either even when I was a part of a wait (customers ahead of me) so its just as fast as McDonalds.  As customers, I also notice other customers are socially distancing too (of course, you would get an  odd ball that seem to not know what is going on in the world and would try to be very close to you, SMH).   Otherwise, burgers are flavourful (not to a point where its so salty that you cant even eat it).  Onion rings are to die so you may want to order more.",3 years ago,2020-11-22 01:20:27.772508,,,,1,13,6,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106662636693073493661/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

I called them on a Sunday evening with concerns about a strong sewage like smell coming from one of my two condo bathrooms. My boyfriend and I had recently moved into this suite and an inspector had told us that one of the toilets had loose pegs / needed the wax ring replaced/resealed. We decided not to use this bathroom until after we had fully moved/settled in to the suite and until the toilet was properly repaired.. but the sudden strong stentch took us by surprise and we knew we needed help. Thankfully Mr. Rooter is 24/7 so you can call and speak with someone ASAP. I cannot even begin to express how kind and patient the receptionist was! They had initially told me that someone would call me back within 10 minutes after I had explained my concerns, yet after waiting 3 hours with no phone call I ended up calling back 2 more times to see what was going on. I understand how annoying this can be, especially when everyone was busy that night with larger tasks, but I was still treated with kindness which was appreciated in the stressful situation. After my third call I got a text from one of the workers (I believe?) saying they could not come by tonight but they were quick to book me in ASAP to have someone come over another day! Thankfully Tuesday morning was free and we were happy to wait. I recieved a call the day before to confirm my appointment and a call the morning of to inform me that the plumber was on their way over / when to expect them by. The communication was excellent! The individual who worked with me today was a blessing! He showed up on time and had a bright personality which helped to relieve my stress. Not only did he do a fantastic job with fixing our toilet, but he took the time to explain/show me what the problem was and how he went about fixing it. There was no need to second guess his work, it spoke for itself! Everything was VERY clean, professional and he was able to help me with a couple extra things he noticed after inspecting the two bathrooms. Every step of the way he kept me informed about cost and didnt pressure me once to try and get more work done. Having the chance to have that conversation and being able to make the call on what to do was great! I was happy to get the additional work done and am beyond pleased with how much better everything is working. The difference is night and day! Thank you so much for providing an excellent service! I will be sure to give you guys a call again should anything come up and will be happy to recommend you to any friends/family looking to have some work done :) Service: Toilet repair",11 months ago,2022-12-22 01:20:32.604968,"Hi Krista, thank you for sharing your experience with Mr. Rooter Plumbing.

We expected it to take twice as long and cost twice as much. He gave us great advice about options for the permanent fix (it was roots in the drain) but he fixed it so we dont have to think about it for a long time, if we choose (dont worry Jaswinder, we wont!) The call centre person was also great - called back several times to give us updates on her search for a technician and when he would arrive, etc. Highly recommend this company and Jaswinder in particular.

Working with Fraserview was extremely easy and the staff prioritize their customers and truly want you to have the best experience. The hall itself is a stunning venue with chandeliers throughout the hall, a massive elevated dancefloor, modern carpeting, high quality speaker system and a gorgeous outdoor balcony that my guests enjoyed majority of their evening taking pictures outside on a sunny day. I can t thank the Manager Antony enough for his exceptional customer service. He is solely the reason why I booked both of my events at Fraserview Hall. I had other deposits at another competing hall but Antony ensured me that I was in good hands and now that my events are over I can 1000% say that Fraserview Hall exceeded my expectations. My family and friends are now booking Fraserview Hall for their events after attending mine. It was the most glamorous Haldi and Wedding Reception I ve ever experienced and booking Fraserview Hall was the best decision! The in house DJ was wonderful and played beautiful songs that my guests and myself could dance all night to. I highly recommend booking the in house DJ, they are very organized and prepare all your songs to make sure everything runs smoothly. The food was absolutely delicious, my guests had second helpings and several people told me their favourite items were the vegetable chow mein, fish pakora, chicken tikka, goat curry and bbq tandoori chicken. I also really enjoyed working with the Decor team. They truly worked their magic and made every detail look absolutely perfect. My Haldi night looked like a Bollywood movie set with all the beautiful bright colours, umbrella arch, glittery table runners, gold elephants and fancy decor pieces.

Overall, it was a great event, and the food was excellent. However, in particular, I would like to thank the gentleman standing outside the front door, who was responsible for security in the evening. We could not find parking so parked in the lot across the street and when he saw us approaching, he let us know that we should move our vehicle, as it would get towed.  During our conversation, we mentioned that we had a handicap parking decal, and he immediately offered us the parking spot that was reserved with pylons right next to the entrance of the hall. This is a level of courtesy that we usually do not see at these types of events.

I didnt catch the gentlemans name, but he was working on Saturday July 29th at 2:25pm, he said he was off at 5:30pm. There is another popular photography studio down the street that does passport photos beside a denture and tax business. But they were so busy they couldnt give me a time to come back. Plus their cost was a bit higher. So I decided to go to London Drugs as my face was already done with full on makeup...I didnt want to redo my look or come back at another time. The gentleman that took my pic was super patient and kind, I didnt feel rushed and he let me retake a few to see which picture I prefered. The camera had a flash mount attached to it, so your face looks flawless, no filter needed :P He was non-judgemental and super fast in developing the pics as well. 2 hard copies with taxes came to $17.91! Plus all sorts of payments are accepted at LD :) The pictures are enclosed in an envelope and stamped at the back. If you need a digital copy, its $4. But you dont really need digital copies for a Canadian passport renewal. Highly recommended to come here!!",3 months ago,2023-08-22 01:20:53.492900,"Hello Lori!

Let me give you a few examples: 1) While the clinic my cousin goes to regularly refused to refer him  to a gastroenterologist, J-Von did it timely and soon he had the endoscopy and colonoscopy done; 2) While the clinic my cousin goes to never called him after receiving the endoscopy and colonoscopy results, J-Von called as soon as they received the fax and booked him immediately for a follow-up to give him peace of mind; 3) After J-Von prescribed my mother a new drug, J-Von called us a few days later for a follow-up. Besides, Dr. Zong, a young doctor, has up-to-date knowledge and is English-Mandarin bilingual. I want to ask you: How many clinics would go that far to do these? None! If you had an unpleasant experience here and if it is all trivia (like with the receptionists, etc.), come on, have some patience and give it more time!

After all, I dont go around town trying different clinics. If I dont like one, I just dont go there anymore. And if I find one thats satisfactory, I will stay there. Im guessing most people are like me. And once in a while (if youre lucky) you will come across a clinic that goes above and beyond your expected level of service and knowledgeable staff. Such is the case with J-VON Medical and Dental. They have set a new standard of what customer service should be. They also have a very well trained team of medical experts and dental professionals. The first time I walked in I was greeted with a friendly smile by the super helpful reception team. They were able to book an appointment time that worked for me, given my busy schedule. And when I came in for my appointment they recognized me and greeted me by my name. How awesome is that? It really felt like a warm personal welcome. The clinics are always clean, and the place looks so modern. All the equipment there looks new and the technology used in some of these are pretty slick. The dentist who was assigned to me was named Howard. I cant say enough of his professionalism and respect. He works with his patients to ensure they have all the information to make the best decision with regards to the treatment plan or procedure. I highly recommend this medical/dental clinic because of the friendly knowledgeable staff, exceptional service, and highly trained professionals. And on top of that, they are so conveniently located next to Metrotown Station and super clean and modern.",6 years ago,2017-11-22 01:21:01.795424,,,,14,123,1000,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111903768203529233245/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

Great service from beginning to end. Like many say, my only regret is that I didnt do this sooner! I was on the fence for a long time regarding SMP. Wasnt sure if it would look ok and where to start looking. Rob James came highly recommended by a colleague. His results looked very natural and I can see the confidence it gave him. I decided to reach out to Rob after looking at looking at his website, Instagram, looking at reviews and even checking out other providers. During our consultation Rob explained the process and expectations. Rob was not only professional, but was very easy to talk to. I wasnt rushed or pressured. It wasnt a pushy sales pitch. He was just extremely knowledgeable and a genuinely kind  person that cares about your results. The studio is private, clean and easy. Everything about it was easy - easy to get to, easy to park, no shared space or hallways with other businesses. A private appointment means just that. Ive completed 3 sessions with Rob and it looks awesome! I love that its natural looking and I am gob smacked at times when looking in the mirror. The sessions in the studio breeze by. Theres always something to talk about and we even talk about nothing. Lots of laughs for sure. You can tell Rob loves what he does and is a craftsman with his work.

I wasnt quite sure in the beginning if SMP was for me. In our initial consultation he walked me through the process, and advised me about what to expect and what can/cannot be done. I liked that he did not attempt to sell himself, gave me pertinent information and answered all of my questions which enabled me to make an informed decision. Previously, I was considering going to the US for this procedure which would have been cumbersome and expensive, but after meeting Rob, I knew right away that he would be my preferred choice for getting SMP done right here in Vancouver. My SMP required four sessions, the first three sessions (4-5 hours each) were spaced about 10 days apart and the final touch-up session around 35 days after the third. As someone who is afraid of needles, I was pleasantly surprised that getting SMP was not painful at all, no numbing cream was used on the scalp, and there were times when I actually dozed off listening to the nice music playing in the background. Conversations with Rob were interesting, entertaining and insightful which made the sessions go by like a breeze. We talked about world affairs, travel, relationships, philosophy to name a few and shared a few good laughs as well. I liked his studio. It was clean, roomy and inviting. The location is ideal, quiet and it is very easy to find free street parking only a few paces away which saved me time and money. My look and hairline gradually improved over the course of the sessions. We adjusted the hairline to achieve the subtle and natural look I wanted. Its been two weeks since my final session and my SMP is looking great. I must say Im quite amazed at the transformation which has made me look younger and may have easily erased a decade off of my age. My friends can hardly tell that I have SMP done which speaks volumes about Robs art and skill. I highly recommend Rob James for SMP procedure as he is a true professional and an artist hard to match in this field. He is a good conversationalist, is skillful and experienced in his trade, and he really makes a sincere effort in listening to you, addressing your concerns and providing the best results possible based on your requirements.

It has been a wonderful experience working with Rob on my SMP. Rob is very knowledgeable, friendly, accommodating and very professional. I was quite nervous during my consultation because I did not know what to expect and had little to know about SMP. Rob took the time to explain everything about SMP and also immediately made me feel very comfortable. My very first session was supposed to be on the 19th Aug but I had to attend a very dear friend s daughter s wedding on the same date. I requested to reschedule my first session on the 24th Jul. Rob was able to quickly offer me the 24th Aug which I was very delighted. Rob is very thorough explaining the details, procedures, expectations and the aftercare. We also shared a lot of great conversations during the procedures which made me feel extremely comfortable. I am extremely happy with the results, his craftsmanship and attention to detail. My partner would look at my scalp after each session and he would just said  wow, it looks so natural! . I guess that says it all. I highly recommend Rob to anyone like me who has been struggling with baldness. He is truly the state of art. Thank you very much, Rob.

From the consultation to the SMP itself, the experience was first class throughout.  The sessions go by in no time - talking to Rob is like talking to an old friend. A word of advice: do yourself a favour and just listen to Rob and trust in his process.  He s an absolute master at his craft. His meticulous nature makes it so his expectations for your SMP (and experience overall) are higher than even your own. Rob has a level of integrity that isn t common nowadays.  He s reassuring, and, more importantly, realistic about what your SMP should/will look like. I was all about density going into the process.  Rob explained to me why he believed a higher density would not look good on me, as it wouldn t naturally tie in with my existing hair/stubble.  When I kept pressing, he politely told me that he may not be the SMP artist I needed. He went so far as to courteously offer to direct me to another SMP artist who would be willing to help.  If I wasn t already sold on Rob, this sealed the deal.  He genuinely cares about his clients, and wants them to leave looking and feeling amazing. I m thrilled with the outcome as my SMP looks phenomenal.  It looks so unbelievably real that even my dermatologist had no idea it was SMP!

Before going ahead with the procedure I did research on practitioners in the local area and Robs extensive portfolio stood out the most. I booked a consultation free-of-charge where Rob was able to answer any questions or concerns I had. Having now completed two session with Rob, I can truly say that I couldnt be happier with the results. Rob is a master of his craft. SMP is a gradual process that takes multiple session to complete which Rob guides you through seamlessly. My biggest concern going into the procedure was finding a hairline that I was happy with while maintaining a realistic look. Rob is highly accommodating and collaborative as he works with you to achieve your desired look. I highly recommend checking out his instagram @robjamessmp where youll find a plethora of photos displaying his range, versatility, and attention-to-detail. Beyond his artistic ability, Rob is an overall pleasure to be around. He is kind, caring, and very easy to talk to. We had many engaging conversations that made the 3-4 hour sessions fly by.

Making the decision to get an SMP was not an easy one for me. It is a semi-permanent decision with many consequences should it be done improperly, especially because of my profession. It took me a long time to finally muster the courage to get it done after over a year of research. I was looking for a natural look as opposed to the edgy or lined-up look. I had seen many botched SMPs and some that just looked horrible. It was not until I came across Rob and his work that I took a chance. And let me tell you, I wish I had done it sooner. He tells you what to expect and truly delivers. His work is so natural that I have had people who hadnt seen me in a while ask me why I shaved my head when I still had hair! Not only is Rob a true master of his art, but he makes you feel as if youve known him for years. He helps put your mind at ease throughout the whole process. Listen to his recommendations and you will not regret it. It was the first time that I could remember where I got a result exactly to what I wanted/expected. Couldnt have been happier with the look.

Gary arrived ahead of schedule, and was very polite and accommodating, even as 7 teen girls screamed out their favourite lyrics at him while he tried to turn the car around. We felt very comfortable with him as a driver. He was polite and made sure to check with me before making any changes to plans.

His customer relationship skills are top notch and I really appreciated the one on one customer feel you provided for me. I myself have worked customer service for years and its always great to chat with someone who has the same kind of attitude. It 100% seals the deal. I was so impressed with how we worked out plans for my transportation on the phone call, that before I had even had my event, or seen our ride, I was already bragging about this company lol Great Job. Finally our bus arrives and its a gorgeous, white, 30 passenger limo bus, absolutely blown away and so were all my guests! Two fantastic guys greeted us and welcomed my crew aboard the boat with again flawless customer service relationship skills. It was a beautiful bus inside and out. You guys killed it from beginning to end and I will be back(Even though I told Sam this was my last limo bus before 30) with more events in the near future!

I was quoted a price that was about the average quote I was getting, but what got me was when I was asked to come view the vehicles. No other company asked me to have a look. So I started to request to see the vehicles from a few companys I had gotten quotes from. 2 companys said no and 3 others allowed me to view. By far Ritz was honest about the seating capacity and size of the busses, the stretch SUV was the same. The day of service we got a phone call from the chauffeurs which was nice. All three vehicles were stocked with ice and water which was nice for a extremely hot day. The chauffeur I was with did a fantastic job; professional, polite, and courteous.

Still drank it all, but probably wouldnt get it again... Other than that, the decor was nice and clean and the atmosphere was quiet and serene. Also, its a little on the expensive side... so definitely more of an experience than a regular hang-out spot.

Nice little shop with cute interior decoration. Service was good. We were a bit confused to see the menu but the staff was explained to us very patiently. Friendly space to hang out with friends and family. Price is reasonable since can enjoy bubble tea and cake at the same time. After tasting the combo we both enjoyed their preset combination. Very unique, creative and aesthetic cup design. The peach cake is my favourite one and they sold out around 3pm today, Im glad to got it. I even ate too fast before I realized to take a picture! Rum cake can taste real rum flavour inside. They hide some raisin inside the cake to bring out the whole texture. Drinks used simple ingredients but very refreshing.

Also tried the   raspberry   cake + hawthorn dates refresher with zero sugar and this was fab too. Now here s my 2 cents on the pricing of the 2 dessert combo - it s pretty fair y all!

It is very creamy with subtle salty and sweet caramelized filling. Unfortunately when I bought the 8inch cake for my mothers birthday November 27, 2021, we discovered the cream in the centre was sour- like sour cream. This made the entire cake taste weird and off-putting . We called the next morning to ask the baker if they knew what happened, although they were not sure and had some hypothesis (maybe they forgot to thin out the cream with fresh cream?) Minus Cake Boutique took ownership of their product and offered to refund (if we bring the cake back) or make a replacement cake. I purchased many times from Minus and a refund was not what I was looking for. I simply wanted to inform them about the quality of their item. There was no way my family could eat another whole  8inch cake (we hate wastage and were determined to carve the sour cream part out of the first cake and make do with what we had) so I suggested making a smaller 6inch one so that we could taste what the cake should taste like. Minus Cake Boutique delivered and we picked up the remade cake and I am grateful and super happy to say, it tasted just the way we remembered it to be. Thank you very much for coming through with excellent customer service. We are very happy and will continue to buy your specialty cakes in the future. Already eyeing another cake for our next festive celebration.",a year ago,2022-11-22 01:21:42.470654,"Hello Sigman, Thank you so much for allowing us the chance to rectify this quality issue.

I didn t know bread sticks were substitution for additional wings for the order. Food was pretty good. All my families were happy even nieces and nephew. Wings were very tasty too. One niece told me it was bit spicy, but everyone else liked it. The deal was unbeatable. Bread sticks were good too. I wish they had extra amount of wings in stock. Food was pretty memorable.

Do pick up to ensure your pizza is fresh and is the correct one. I ordered my pizza after dance class around 10 and it was ready in 10 minutes. I highly suggest ordering a pizza and picking it up vs buying a slice at the window. I bought the shahi paneer pizza and the flavours are amazing. If you like indian style pizza, this is a place to check out. Original review: Pizza was ok. Stumbled upon this place while waiting for the bus. Ill try ordering a whole pizza next time.

Don t forgot to ask for tomatoes, onions etc on the side. Also get their garlic naan! It matches so perfectly with this dish! Chicken was a bit dry, but I like to shred them into pieces. Love the amount of chicken Chicken tikka masala: this is super delicious and have a more refreshing herb and spices taste to it.

Needless to say, both Professional Hazard and age has caught up to me and I need intense physiotherapy for my neck, shoulders, arms, hips and legs. Basically, a full overhaul of my joints, ligaments and muscles. I came to see my dear friend Krishna Jeeja at her MJ Physio clinic on Fraser St and 41st in Vancouver and started my treatment. I was quite nervous as asides from the few massages I have had with my wife at couples spas I have never been to any sort of therapy in this regard. Krishna completely made me feel at ease, explaining to me the details of my therapy and what was required. She made correct analysis on all of my problem joints in my body and exactly described my pain as if it was me talking. She is very knowledgeable on the workings of the human body. I feel an intense decrease in pain ever since Krishna started treating me, as a matter of fact I feel much better now than I have in years though I am aware it will take more than a few sessions to correct my body alignment. As I have been having intense pain in my ankle bones as well as my shoulders and neck Krishna was very quick in identifying the problem as bursitis. I assumed that only cortisol can treat this pain but I was hesitant of ever getting that treatment done. After Krishna told me they treat bursitis through laser  I am looking forward to getting laser treatment done in their Surrey location. I will recommend this place to anyone in need of physio. Krishna is kind hearted, professional, direct and an absolute joy to talk to. She is friendly and makes you feel at ease. Their facility has a nice gym, state of the art equipment and a very friendly receptionist. For the first time in my life I feel that I will get better and continue my work in music.

This year I have fallen in love with Pickleball, playing almost everyday. The problem , playing outside on the hard court surface almost everyday,  it was giving me knee pain . My family doctor said it is arthritis in my knees and will have to ice and rest my knees every time I play.  Went for treatment with Ram . He checked me over and said with my range of motion ,I do not have arthritis . Ram gave me stretching exercises as well as IMS ( deep needle),muscle contraction and other Physio treatments . I can happily say my treatments were successful with no more Knee pain. I have been going for preventative treatment now every 2 - 3 weeks and still pain free playing Pickleball or Raquetball everyday .  I tell my story to anyone who has any sports pain. Ram gets my highest recommendation....Thanks so much Ram! posted 2019 : I was unsuccessful  with massage therapy  and chiropractors for my sports lower back pain. After one treatment with MJ Physio I felt less pain and could continue my gym and raquet sports workouts . After 4 treatment sessions I feel completely healed . Their treatments of IMS, massage , stretching , electrical contraction machine and an exercise regime has completely made my back 100 % better . Highly recommend Ram and his Partner to my family and friends if they have muscle / joint pain. Thanks MJ Physio for your excellent effective treatment for my lower back injury . I will not hesitate to call on you again if I have another injury.",2 years ago,2021-11-22 01:22:04.583179,Thank you for the appreciation Michael,4 years ago,2019-11-22 01:22:04.583179,1,3,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102376872607524200851/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

I agree with the other reviews that it takes quite a while to get your order. My order: Sour Cream & Onion Loopy Fries (size: Mega) I really liked how it wasn t greasy at all. It s like a hybrid between fries and chips. The seasoning was great, not overly salty (had a hint of sweetness to balance the flavour), and evenly coated as well. Very crispy, and stays crispy - no sogginess even at the bottom. Process: They take your order, and then you wait for your fries to come out of this (air fryer-like?) machine - which takes a while, then they dump the fries into a tray, scoop them back up to throw them in a bucket to shake with seasoning (by hand), then throw them BACK on ANOTHER tray after seasoning, then scoop them up into your bucket/bag. Seems tedious, but I assume they have their reasons as they re a huge chain and very popular in Asia.",2 years ago,2021-11-22 01:22:14.880273,,,,3,174,712,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104674524383379153496/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

My kids and family loved the fries.  The kids loved the corn and I wish we ordered bigger size.

Unfortunately was told that they had no more ice and also was informed by the attendant that I would have a hard time finding some due to the heat wave. I was busy at the time getting the food and  supplies for my camping trip, now driving around finding ice was the last thing I wanted to do. So I decided to look up for companies that sell ice, to my surprise I clicked on this certain link and it caught my attention. The crazy thing about this is that the place was 20 meters away from my location. Feeling like a kid from a candy shop,  I had the choices of different type of ice I wanted. They explained to me the best type of ice to use cause I told them I was going camping. Using a block of ice to keep your food or beverage cold in a cooler goes goes way further than getting ice cubes on a bag. Found that out quickly when I was at the camp ground and that fellow friends ice were already melting and their coolers were filled with water. Very appreciated from their tips and the price of ice is a  way better deal than any local stores. They just deal with ice and the people or business that need it. Quick and simple.

This guy is an exceptional Realtor! My experience with Brandon is I first had seen his face everywhere. It started with busstops, billboards, note pads  then one day I was driving down Kingsway and bam!!   right beside me is a 4 foot image on a car of Brandon! I went home and told my wife I think I found our realtor. I called Brandon and he came to our current home at the time and gave us a breakdown on market/value. He is very well spoken , confident , handsome young man and has his finger on the heartbeat of the market so we decided to list. We listed aggressively as he suggested and this fetched us multiple offers with our property going 80k over asking!! What a beauty! This was only one experience with Brandon. The second experience is a single family home in Montecito burnaby. I had fully renovated. Brandon showed up and fell in love with the place. I told Brandon  do you think we can get $2.5  we had purchased 1.5 years prior for $1.840 he said yeah l let s try! I believed that if anyone could fetch this number it would be him. Brandon had beautiful photos taken, drone shots, and a walk through video featuring,  yes! The one and only Brandon Gee Moore!! Brandon got us the number we wanted yet again for another huge win. Now we had sold and we did not have a house to move to only a pocket full of cash. This is great but not when you have a pregnant wife and two other kids!

I was in my other residence for 16 years and was honestly overwhelmed by the thought of selling and then finding a place such that I thought someone like Brandon would be absolutely essential.  He was an incredibly honest and enthusiastic person from the beginning.  When it came to selling my home he had a collection of listings in the area presented in a binder so  quickly that I was amazed.  This prospectus enabled me to be realistic about what to list my home for and how to respond to changes in prices in the units around me.  He never pushed me to change my price but rather discussed the differences between units and what they were subsequently asking so that we could come to an effective solution with respect to my listing.  My place sold and I strongly believe that it was one of the few as the market dropped, and was directly related to his endless effort.  He guided me through the process of selling and then found the perfect place for me where I had really hoped I would end up very quickly!  He then expedited the buying process so that we were the first offer and we were able to buy the unit right away!!  In addition to all of this, he was a wealth of information regarding aspects related to moving out and moving in as he had a vast awareness of great people such as my Notary and movers.  Throughout this process he was always a step ahead of everyone and very effective in his actions.

Brandon Gee-Moore assisted me in the sale of a newer rental property condo near Brentwood in Burnaby, BC just before Christmas (2021), and I have rarely been as impressed with someone as I was with him. Brandon was a true professional from start to finish and is one of those rare breeds of people who actually does what he says he will. Not some of the time, but all of the time. And is humble and down to earth to boot. With an infectious, positive attitude, and fun to do business with. Every obstacle (and there were a few along the way) was met with a can-do attitude, and a solution that moved us all along. Brandon follows up leads on his website in a timely manner (to get your business, a good start), comes fully prepared to buyer or seller meet and greet meetings, and I found him to have excellent knowledge of current market conditions and current market selling prices. He uses good professionals (such as photographers), manages the showings and sales processes professionally, and closes win-win deals. In my case as a seller, we had three full price offers within a week (in the slow period of Nov 16-30 just before Christmas 2021), that all fell through for various reasons (financing turned down, etc). Not to worry, we got a fourth full price offer, and that sealed the deal. I enjoyed working with Brandon, and found him to be a true professional, and I would highly recommend him to any friends or associates, or others just looking for a good broker, on either the buying or selling side.

Given that I work about 10 mins away, I arrived approx 20 mins after the phone call and had to wait another  8-10 mins while the receptionist was on the phone with no acknowledgement. After she took my ID and set me up, I asked  her how long it will take for someone to meet me and she tells me that the doctor has gone on break and wont be back for another at least 30 mins and that there is someone else in front of me. I have no issue waiting my turn and am not upset by this at all. That was completely fair, I saw the women ahead of me waiting before I got there. When I tell the receptionist that I was under the impression there was no wait given what she had told me on the phone, she told me that since the doctor saw no one was there, he went on break. I am not saying that the doctor does not deserve a break but at least schedule the breaks or close the clinic for the 30 mins - 1 hour that break takes place. I have seen many clinics use this method and it works best.

Prices and selection were very competitive. Installed luxury vinyl plank. Interaction with staff in office and on site was good but project did take about 3 times longer than quoted. There was more leveling work than anticipated which added understandable time but there were delays due to running out of materials and conflicting schedules with other projects. They did confirm my painters could come paint mounted baseboards one day but painters had to go home when they showing up and baseboards had not been mounted as promised. Was also promised exact material match on stair noses but was told on day of install that it would be best match similar material. It looks great but misleading promise on sales floor. Translucent silicone used on edges of half the stairs and white caulk use on there half because they ran out of materials which looks strange now. Some risers have scuffs and glue marks. Also last minute changes from vinyl transition to metal transitions for technical reasons on slope of transition which should have been identified in two site visits before project started. They worked to rectify issue and supplied extra transitions so we can change them on our own in the future. Had a hard time getting all baseboards remounted as agreed and ended up remounting some on my own to save time on project and not have to keep asking. Had to point out several corrective action where material did not hide properly under baseboards, stairs etc. These were corrected quickly but ended up leaving some because I got tired of pointing them out and having to schedule site visits. Told me they would screw down plywood floors in areas that had squeaking but this not done. Quite a bit of scuffs on jewly painted walls and resedue of leveling compound on some walls which I had to scrape off.  I am very conflicted in this review because they did try there best to fix things but it seems like lots of the things should have just been done right the first time. We are happy with the floors and would have given a higher rating if we didnt have to go through the little stresses along the way.

Other issues: - Original expectations were that they would do the kitchen flooring as well. But they bailed on doing the entire floor because of some custom cabinetry that is raised above the flooring on elevated stilts. So half of the kitchen flooring is incomplete (old flooring hidden under the cabinetry). Would have been much better to be up front about that at the beginning. - They promised to replace our baseboards, but during the renovations they said the original baseboards were fine and asked if they would just use those. We ask for them to go ahead with new ones thing they would do the full job. Instead they cut new baseboards without painting them properly and never added caulking. So we were left to do that our selves. - They messed up one of our closet doors (couldn t get it to fit back in) so they cut it. Now the one door doesn t match the height of the other. Overall, a lot of the issues could have been prevented with better communication on their part before and during the project. They also rushed at the end to finish up.

I had the most horrible experience with BC floors. They basically act as middle man and subcontract your project to others that literally have no knowledge of flooring and they will ruin your material and flooring. First off, I had to call Keit, the project manager to give me a quote, literally everyday two to three times. After a full week of calling her, she finally gave me a sloppy quote without coming to my place to see what the scope is. I had a tight schedule and made the worst mistake to pay them to do the job. Then their subcontractor came to my place without knowing what the scope of work is. He was supposed to remove the existing flooring on the stairs and install new stairs using the materials I have bought. He totally damaged all of the stairs while removing the existing stairs and noted that the floors now need leveling and demanded more money. As I was deep into this mistake, I agreed. Then he installed all flooring and stairs wrong and ruined the whole floor and stairs. The stairs nosing fell off after 2 days and I noticed that it is sitting on a hollow space!!! The flooring moves when I walk on it. When I complained to Keit, BC Floors PM, she accused me that I am lying. I had to fight a whole week with BC floors to prove that their subcontractor has ruined my materials and the stairs. After fighting for over a week and getting penny pinched along the way and arguing with me over every $10 I paid, I ONLY got around 88% of my money back and NOT the full payment. I have already spent more than $1000 out of pocket and still need to find another contractor to fix my stairs. I have never experienced such horrible service and customer service.

I don t blame them with any malice. I think they ve been professional, but that doesn t change the fact my experience was... bad. I was asking them to renovate a carpet on behalf of a client in Burnaby (this was for an apartment with 2 small bedrooms) and I had a good first impressions. The salesman was friendly, I liked their carpet selection and I do like the job their installer did and the final result. To be clear, this company does good work. The carpet itself is beautiful. So I don t think they are normally incompetent like this. However, the salesman I had ... well I think he was a fine guy and he had good carpet recommendations. The issue was he messed up. First of all, he forgot to account the long weekend messing up carpet deliveries which pushed the project back. That... was okay since he let me know ASAP and got the carpet to the installer. So I ve forgiven him for that. The main reason for my poor review is the fact he grossly miscalculated the amount of carpet needed. He gave us a quote for 2000 cad which was around what the other companies in the area offered. However, we needed 54 yards, he estimated 34. This meant that the project needed an additional 1170 Canadian, bringing up the project to 3170 cad. The company did give me a discount of 170 dollars, which was appreciated, but this sudden extra 1000 dollar cost is not welcome. I understand the company s position, but this was a hell of a mistake. We honestly would not have chosen this company if the actual quote was presented upfront. Furthermore, we chose them with the understanding that two bedrooms would be completed... not one. Edit: After re-measuring and re-reading the original contract I realized that while there was an opportunity for me to actually catch the mistake. However, the fact that a professional and who came and measured the apartment and yet messed the estimate up that badly is still outrageous, and it doesn t change the fact that the initial quote was completely off by more than 50% of the cost. ADDITIONALLY, the contract says 2 bedrooms. The fact that they messed up how much carpet to order should not be up to me, but on the company representative who ordered the carpet and made the contract with the understanding that that amount of carpet was enough. However, I also realized that he contract itself had one huge issue in which it isnt actually clear about how much carpet was supposed to be installed. It listed a number of yards of carpet, which I originally thought referred to length of the roll. The issue is... yards to this company means yards squared.... which... is... just not clear.",5 years ago,2018-11-22 01:23:01.534605,"Thank you for your review.

I dealt with bloating, hypothyroidism and iron deficiency while doing shift work which all lead to a decline in my health. I went from almost 130lbs of skinny fat to 114lbs of muscle. He has helped me obtain the physique Ive always wanted and the strength I never knew that I had. He s incredibly attentive, knowledgeable, and an overall genuine trainer and boxing coach.  His positive attitude and approachable nature makes me feel completely at ease. I cannot recommend David enough as he truly knows what he is doing and you will see how he genuinely cares about your goals. He radiates passion and dedication for his clients and I absolutely love training with him. He will make you succeed with your fitness goals.

As a trainer, she listens to what your fitness goals are and really caters to that.

She takes time to make sure you re all warmed up, massages out any tight muscles from prior workouts, and switches workouts up often to make sure you re avoiding that plateau.

After going to a highly rated but VERY questionable veterinary practice in Vancouver, we finally brought our cat and dog to the clinic. I must admit, at first I thought, Huh, its in a pet store. It might not be the first place I would have thought to take our pets, but we love our neighborhood Tisol, and its close by in case of emergency. We have had great experiences here. Totally exceeded expectations. Dr. Uri and Dr. Hannah  are both very knowledgeable.  Together, they have now correctly diagnosed and treated: our Boston Terriers knee problem, my cats weird extra rib thing, an ear infection my cat has probably had for years, allergies, etc. Just when we were thinking Vancouver was some weird unregulated veterinary wasteland,  were so happy we found competent, professional, caring vets right down the street at the pet store. They dont try to sell you stuff you dont need or extract all your cats teeth to finance their vacation to Thailand. They do urge gold standard veterinary medicine, and while some people might not want to pay for diagnostic tests, etc., I believe they would only order a test  if they felt it was truly in the pets best interest.",7 years ago,2016-11-22 01:23:15.739282,,,,8,2,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115122308247646610838/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

Was not easy to see but he did it!! Then he repeated the miracle last month. QQs growth is again, not malignant and I dont have the words to to express how grateful I am and how much I want other patients to know what an outstanding person and vet Uri is. I have had the opportunity to recently have worked on a project with him, outside of the office. He shines, not only as a vet, but as warm, sincere, and fun person.

Theyre supposed to be a walk-in clinic, but whenever I walk in, they dont have any vets available.  Either theyre not there or busy for the next 1-2 hours.  Fine, so I tried calling in for an appointment before going.  Appointment confirmed by the front desk, then I must have gotten 2-3 calls asking me to reschedule for various reasons. Finally settled on an appointment, then I go in and I still have to wait a long time to be seen.  Every other time I had to make an appointment and every time I had to wait 15-30 mins. Then there were the issues with the food.  I was sold a bag of prescription food that expired within a month of the purchase date, but I didnt know until I got home.  I asked to return it, but I was told they had a no return policy.  They said I was told that I was buying almost expiring food and was given a discount.  I was not told this, and the invoice didnt note this either.  Finally spoke to a manager and had to settle for a credit for half the amount. Another issue with food, I was quoted one price over the phone and when I went in to pay for it, they raised the price.  My dog needed it, so I couldnt say no...  Not happy. The vets there are good though, and attentive...  So it seems the issues really are from the front desk staff only.

I saw the reviews for Vancouver East Veterinary Walk-In Clinic so we booked our cat in here. Sadly, this was a huge mistake on our part. We took our cat in for her annual checkup. All of the documents were transferred from our previous vet to this one, so it should have her up to date vaccine information and other health background. Unfortunately, Dr. Shura didnt even pay attention to her vaccination history anyways, and despite our cat having gotten her 3-year vaccines in 2018, he said it was done in 2017 and then vaccinated her anyways. I didnt notice this until I got home and saw my previous invoices from the previous vet that said she last got the vaccination in 2018. A few days after we got home from the vet, my cats hair started falling out in the area where the vaccination was injected. We tried calling Vancouver East Veterinary Walk-In Clinic on Wednesday at around 10AM and there was no pick-up (they are closed most of the week, open only for limited hours in the afternoon), no voice mail, and no emergency line you can call. We ended up having to drive back to our old vet to get her looked at because that was our only option. I understand that adverse side effect may happen after a vaccination, but I am very disappointed that the vet misread her vaccination history and gave her something she didnt need, and also we werent able to reach them or an alternate number. When we were getting our cat looked at, Mr. Shura said to us that he doesnt like to overvaccinate animals because hell get our money through teeth cleanings anyways (he had recommended a teeth cleaning for our cat).

Your reception staff must disclose to all patients that there is a $50 no show fee even for phone call appointments. To force someone to pay this fee after a phone call was missed for legitimate reasons ESPECIALLY when it was not disclosed upon booking is borderline robbing. Please reconsider your policy surrounding phone vs. in-person appointments and/or re-train reception staff to be more considerate of patients circumstances. It seems they can greatly benefit from a lesson in using discretion. Not every patient visits the clinic frequently enough to see the notices for themselves. It is the job of the front desk receptionists to make policies transparent. Such a shame to have encountered hostility from your staff after so so many years of being a patient (my entire life so far to be exact...). To expect us to constantly bend our equally busy schedules to fit into the odd schedules of all the doctors here is impractical and a quick way to lose patients. I am starting to think I am better off finding a different practice to seek health care. The current front desk team is truly mediocre at their job at best. Edit: reply received and read.

If our patients have an emergency or a legitimate reason, we usually waive the no show fee and end with a warning. Phone appointments are just as important as in-person appointments, which is why there is a no show fee for phone calls as well.

You initially requested a weekend appointment a few months ago, and we were, unfortunately, unable to accommodate your ask as it fell outside our hours of operation. I did, however, still help you the best I could by locating another clinic near you as an alternative. Your request and my subsequent email correspondences occurred during a brief period when we experienced difficulties with our email server, something for which I apologized for at the time. As I am sure you know, it is an unfortunate reality that technology does not always work the way we expect it should despite our best efforts. When you spoke with my colleague last week requesting an appointment, she informed you of our clinic policy which requires new patients to present to the clinic by walk-in for their first visit. I am afraid you may have confused these two different exchanges, which occurred nearly eight months apart, as one occurrence, one of which was not your own. Nevertheless, I feel it is important to offer insight into any misconceptions you may still have about how a medical clinic, specifically our clinic, operates so that you are better informed in the future when trying to access care. The foundation of a walk-in clinic operates on the principle that a patient may present to a clinic without an appointment to access urgent or time-sensitive medical care on the same day. This concept will cease to exist in its practical sense if there is an expectation that clinics should schedule appointments in advance. Moreover, scheduling appointments ahead of time in a walk-in setting will make it extremely difficult for patients in need of urgent care to receive timely care. With that said, we also recognize that,  for a number of people, an appointment system is more ideal due to personal or professional commitments. For this reason, we operate as a hybrid by offering both walk-in and appointment services so that we may better accommodate everyone. To ensure we can accomplish this successfully, a number of different policies have had to be implemented to organize how and when each service can be rendered. One such policy is that new patients are required to present to the clinic by walk-in for their first appointment. This allows us to validate a new patients information, and ensure they are adequately informed of our clinic policies. While we acknowledge that not everyone will be agreeable to this caveat, it has ultimately allowed us to increase access to care for patients by drastically reducing our no-show rate so we may use resources, such as physician time, more efficiently. Therefore, although we are a business and some of our policies may not always equate to good business acumen, we feel it would be unethical to compromise the quality of care and access to medical services by operating as though healthcare is about commerce rather than the health and well-being of people. I hope the information above can help you understand the events that lead up to your experience, but should you need further clarification for our clinic procedures, I would be happy to address your concerns, so please do not hesitate to contact me.

Frankly, theres nothing more important to me than knowing these folks arent treated poorly. Weve had these cleaners coming by since the fall and theyve been great. They show up almost universally on-time or early, clean the place thoroughly (I can see myself in the tile), and theyre all very friendly. The price is good too my partner and I due to the pandemic didnt have to pay for 2 zone bus passes anymore and that was more than enough to pay for 1 visit a month for our 850~ sq foot low-junk apartment in the burbs. We were happy enough with the service that we upped it to 2 visits and thats enough to keep this place in great shape. Theyve been great about the restrictions and so have we, they work in the bedrooms and we go to the living room, they finish in there and we swap so they can do the rest of the place, windows open, air circulating!

Look beneath what is visible on the surface and what you see are old friends stitched together from the bonds of war, men and women who have seen inordinate levels of loss, yet are bound by their camaraderie and companionship to meet and greet each other despite the ongoing battles this world invariably succumbs to. This is what people miss. So make your way down to the local arena of friendship. I highly recommend it.",a year ago,2022-11-22 01:23:37.860959,,,,0,76,34,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117790652654372637397/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

Pre-Covid, when my mother in law had some dizzy episodes on a Saturday, we call the office, they fit her in with another doctor in the office and follow up with a letter to Emergency. Currently, they do either phone appointments or in office appointments and most times when we are in the phone appointment, if the doctor needs to see what is concerning (a rash, take blood pressure, etc.), they do their best to find time to let you come in, luckily for us it was within the same day. They referred my mother in law for a geriatrician, and Dr Zhang is also located in the same office. Very efficient in communication and coordination. Before the Geriatrician appointment, the staff called us twice with reminders. I appreciate the calls and reminders. The online booking is the only negative.

Besides being closer to my home, it is inferior in every way to the old clinic I would go to. The staff, while friendly, are mostly unhelpful and refuse basic things (like calling a taxi for patients).

This clinic also doesnt allow you to leave messages outside of clinic hours and doesnt have a voicemail system set up at all, making it impossible to cancel or reschedule appointments if youre sick or outside a normal business hours routine.

I went to her lovely home and met her cat crew. This is my second kitten from her in the last year. Just before Xmas last year my daughter and I got a little ginger girl and we love her so much we wanted to give her a friend.  Of course we went back to Nikki and she didn t let us down. Nikki briefly spoke of how some of these cats as well as dogs,  had been treated prior to her stepping in and rescuing them and about how the pandemic and natural disasters have increased the poor faith of these vulnerable animals.  She really cares for animals.  She is defiantly a cat lady through and through. The work she does for these animals is incredible. I don t know what will happen to all the animals in the b.c in distress when she retires. Although I can t see her retiring bc she cares too much about animals being treated badly. Weather it be an issue of hoarding, owners on substances and or natural disasters. As well as her program for seniors she is right on it. We often get caught up in our busy lives and  forget about animals and there well being.  If you can t adopt a cat from Nikki please consider sponsoring a cat or make a donation.

The cat I was looking after was in poor health from the beginning.  Any time I called to get approval to go to the vet, Nikki would shriek at me saying he is  Just an old cat.  I m going to have him euthanized.    The first time she said that, I left the cat at the vets certain he would be killed.  Five days later, the vet called me to pick him up.  I was in SHOCK. Every occasion I had to deal with her was traumatizing and unpleasant!!  A horrible experience.  Abusive. Uses pre-approval to get out of paying.  Stay away from this one. I spent over $3,000 in medical care on my own and she owes me $1500 from pre-approved vet visits which she refuses to pay.  All from the scam that the visits weren t pre-approved.

This place has become my favourite go to for a quick fix of dumplings. It s just a small hole in the wall, short menu but focused on what they do best, delicious dumplings. Low prices are a plus too. With just a few tables, it gets crowded very fast. It s definitely worth the wait. I m amazed at how much volume they can put out in such a small kitchen, but the staff are really efficient.  My favourites are the pan fried pork buns and pan fried dumplings.  There s a new item in the menu, Shanghai mini wontons but there s nothing mini about them.  The seaweed in soup broth adds a different twist that s a bit like a fusion of Japanese flavours.

You won t find anywhere else for this price at this quality.  I ve been here many times and always ordered the xiao long baos.  I d say it s best in town as the skin is thinnest of all the places I ve tried. The Szechuan beef noodle is good as well.  The pic here is of the pork chop noodles. Simple broth and tasty meat. The only thing I don t like is that they put the pork on the noodles so they get soggy quickly. It d be better if they came on a separate plate. The pan fried pork buns are amazing. Very juicy inside and the buns are soft and fluffy. I ve also tried the green onion pancake and they re good as well. These don t taste as  homemade  but good nonetheless.

We had the chance to eat at Plato Filipino and I can say that they have delicious Filipino food, and sure, some dishes may need more love, but what restaurant in this world has a perfect record when it comes to pleasing everyone? When you have a problem with your food, you should at least try to be courteous and calmly tell the people in the restaurant what you didnt like: the texture, taste, plate, whatever you think is valid.

He quoted a job for $2000 plus when my friends brother in law quoted us after all the headaches Kevin gave us for only $1000. Another part he quoted us we needed replacing for $500 when at Home Depot same part was only for $90. This guy should have his license removed. He ended up flooding our house when he triggered one of the sprinkler. Now thanks to him we are living in a temporary house far from my daughters school.
