Sam, who usually takes care of office activities always greet you with a smile when you walk in and rest of the staffs are also friendly and helpful. All machines and equipments are working well. I have seen people working out having proper gym etiquette than the other branch - such as, putting weights back, wiping down equipments. The washrooms at this branch are also much cleaner and larger than some of the other ones Ive been to. I highly recommend this gym to everyone for their fitness goal and have a experience just like a family.",

Everyone is so welcoming, kind, and supportive. The machines and equipment are great and are always working. I ve been to other gyms that have needle dispensaries in the washrooms, but you will definitely not find anything like that here. The members are all there for the same reason, to grow and better themselves. This is something you would expect is the norm at most gyms, but unfortunately, it s not!! I always look forward to coming to this gym and getting a workout in. If i m ever not feeling my best, my mood is quickly lifted by the friendly staff. When I first started training here, I was very shy and quiet. My main goal was to get my work out done and leave. Almost two years later and I am grateful to call these people my friends. My fitness journey would never be where it is if it weren t for these lovely people who approached me, pushed me out of my shell, and helped me gain confidence. They took the time to educate me on fitness, specifically weightlifting, and helped me when needed, with my form or a spot, etc.  They genuinely care :) That is what makes this gym different.",

It was a bit intimidating when I walked in for my first workout, but the staff there are fantastic, very friendly and welcoming. Its a busy place with people coming and going and they do a good job enforcing the health & capacity requirements. Equipment is clean and well maintained and I have never had to wait more than about 5 minutes to get in. I decided to sign up with a personal trainer to get me on track and teach me how to use the equipment and that has gone very well. I would recommend a PT for a gym novice....its not cheap, but worth it. It has been well over a month now and I am now comfortable in a gym environment and I always look forward to my next visit.

My  favorite area of the gym and selling point is the functional fitness area ; they have sandbags, kettlebells, battle ropes, tires, sled, power racks, bumpers plates, etc. They also have the standard machines, free weights, racks and cardio area; I highly recommend this gym",

The staff is very friendly and approachable, even though they have a lot of clients they find time in their day to have conversations with them before, after and during the clients workouts.  There is nothing I can really complain about, this is a top notch gym that I have recommended to my friends and still recommend to people looking for a good gym.

Most of the time there are about 4-5 people. Staff members and personal trainers are friendly. Plenty of locker space, 3 shower/bathrooms. Fitness classes in the mornings and evenings. Membership pricing is fair, and if theres something wrong, they will try to fix it. I havent encountered those stereotypes  where gym will try to upsell you or refuse to cancel membership. Contracts are fair, as long as you go by the contract, they dont give you hard time. Ive been with this gym since it opened in 2013.",

Everybody was kind nervous and must wear the masks all the time . But everyone was working out hard and kind of feeling strong and positive . Really appreciate this gym kept opening during covid .  Thank God that the COVID is ended . Personally I really love this gym as it s big and modern plus The facilities are great . Staffs are very friendly... especially the coaches..I also introduced a male friend of mine to the gym and he bought one year personal training with the coach Louis . And I introduced another female friend to joined the gym to I have One suggestion   that hope the owner can read it . ( I suggested managers several times but not working . ) . If this gym has the rule ( No Heavy weights smashing ) that May help this gym environment in a safer . harmony . and may help the business grow. My suggestion is Please put a Sign ( don t drop weights heavily) next to the all weights areas that I saw in other gyms has it which is really help . Please let the stafffs especially the sales team Educate all new members + old members should drop the weights carefully not drop the weights very heavily that can make a huge noise and the floor is shaking . This second floor is standing so much  massive weighs include the hundreds heavy metal machines and heavy weights . Plus the busy crowd . How much weights total are in this gym ? I m worrying about mostly because it s on Second floor not on the ground . I will never worry about this issue if it s on the ground floor . I really don t like the some clients smash the weights so loudly which is hurting others ears   and feelings as well .. please support me if anyone saw my suggestion here that you are thinking sane as me . Peace   and love",

I love this gym cause its near at 10 minutes from home and 10 from my work, I start to work at 6 am on the morning everyday with no specific end timing usually 7pm. The last three weeks I was on the gym at 4:00am (my only time possible) with a couple people around. Perfect for the circuits and bi series of workout talking about the machines and everything. Thats impossible in the weekdays on rush hours. Everyone knows that the workouts its different for each person so I think some people have different needs including to reach their goals muscle gain, losing weight etc. Thats why the 24 hours could works too and with less people around its safer than the rush hours.  Im thinking to going today and cancel my membership and going to another one with the 24/7 hours service. Anyway Im a simple person who lose 40 kgs 12 years ago trying to keep and maintain his weight. My two cents.",

One cool thing about the classes is that, if youre unable to attend to one of the scheduled times, you can play video instructions on the rooms wall projector at any time. This is a very spatious place and, in addition to the common area, there is also an area for personal training, and a workout area for women only (although many of them prefer to use the common area because it has a better variety of machines).

The old staff is gone which is understandable as people tend to move on, the place is now starting to show lack of maintenance on the equipment, the washrooms are not being cleaned and they still have no wifi.  My husband and I have decided to cancel our membership as were paying $120.00 per month for what? When we went to the front counter to speak about cancelling, the woman said ok and she proceeded to cancel. No questions like, may I ask if there is anything I can do to change your mind or assist you with, just a simple ok. Our membership expires in November which we are going to check out places like Steve Nash, Anytime Fitness and other places. The only staff member there is the person who signed us up is Jared. Maybe we should reach out to him but we feel now the damage is done. Goodlife fitness, retaining your clients, keeping the place clean, up with the maintenance and give the dam wifi like you have used as your sales pitch may keep your members and bring in even more. Everything about this post is true, so what excuses or lies are you prepared to give.... Yours Truly Davi and Marc",

I saw him for IMS/Dry Needling two days ago. He is super outgoing, professional, and gets the job done quick and well. I ve seen other physios before and he is by far the best. I will definitely go back to see him for all of my future physio needs  :) 5/5.",

I was concerned how I would be viewed as I have gained a lot of weight since the break from gym due to my accident.  I was putting off joining gym again as I was embarrassed about how I now looked. I set up an appointment with Ruba to find out about joining again.  Ruba was super friendly, knowledgeable, and so kind.  I was put at ease as there was no judgement.  While there I saw a lot of other members of staff who remembered and greeted me.  They were super kind.  Ruba then made an appointment for my free personal training session with Paolo. As soon as I met Paolo I knew that he would be very helpful in my path to getting back to the way I was before the accident.  He is very patient, kind and explains what each exercise benefits are in a fun way.  He also adjusted each exercise according to my mobility limitations. I feel positive I will get to my goal of how I was before the accident. I am truly grateful to Golds for putting me back on track.  Even though it might take a while.  I am motivated by Paolo and I am trying hard to get there again. I really appreciate all the kindness and positive encouragement I have been given.  I will work till I achieve my goal of getting back to how I was before.  Happy, Healthy, and Strong. Thank you so much for your help with my journey.

They offer many group classes they are all very hard good classes especially the power class( weights class) and Blast class( hard cardio workout). Gold gym have been very flexible with holding your membership during Covid time so I give them credit for that for sure . They also have many promotions and my favourite is offering same price of my membership to my friends ( you can t beat that). My membership is 23 bucks per month. You can t get better deal than that - 24 hours gym workout and including these classes . Great atmosphere when you get in there and love to see all ages taking care of themselves",

Everytime you walk into the gym, the workers greet you very well despite how early or late it is. I ve managed to build bonds with some of them as well. Ruba the general manager for example. I only first saw her about 3-4 months ago but when I started making small talk with her, she gave me super chill vibes and is approachable.  Very kind and makes golds a welcoming place. Now I make sure to say hello to her whenever I can. There s also cole who I can laugh and talk with at the gym. There s also Christina who always asks me how I am when I walk in. She will also remember who you are because she prioritizes customer service. Basically the environment is very friendly because of the staff and members. Anyone who is new to lifting shouldn t be afraid to come work out here. The equipment is also great. Whenever machines need to be fixed, it will be taken care of within 3-5 days. And a very clean and safe place. paolo is good too",

The staff are really friendly and helpful especially Sam who always makes me feel welcome the minute I walk in the door. The trainers are really good too. Ive been training with Paolo for just over a month now and the amount of progress & improvement I have seen in myself is unbelievable. Hes helped me a lot to improve my fitness level and I dont think my gym performance would be anywhere near where it is today without him. Plus he makes workouts fun and not boring.

You are always made to feel like you belong there. The facility communicates verbally, through signage, and with online emails, and webpages. COVID precautions were followed diligently. After a year of membership, interrupted by COVID, I decided to retain the assistance of a personal trainer with some mobility and fitness issues. Erica Lee was chosen based on my spouse s experience helping her with her fitness and mobility issues. We are 69 and 70 years old otherwise very fit for our age. Erica, through a painful supervised and assisted exercise routine has dramatically improved my mobility to do my ordinary activities of daily living. Having lots of strength and cardio exercise capacity does not work well if movement is painful or restricted. She has improved the quality of my life in ways I could not do for myself. Erica supervises  and assists my workout twice a week. My plan is continue this program with Erica indefinitely.. thank you Golds Gym",

In the mens locker room 9 showers, shampoo, shower gel, hair conditioner.  In the shower clean. Large towel issued at the entrance. There is a Finnish and Turkish sauna. Several bars with drinking water. Vertical turbo solarium, several massage chairs. I used a free ticket for 3 visits during the week.  This is a super offer!

My first time in, a really friendly staff member gave me a tour and made me feel so at home. The gym is very clean, even the showers and towels. The staff always greet me upon entry and seem eager to answer any questions I may have. The atmosphere in the gym is really great due to the variety of people that attend. The women s section is quite small, but still has all equipment necessary to get a good workout in. The overall layout of the gym is really fantastic and there s plenty of space for a hiit setup, walking exercises or jump roping. Thank you for having created such a safe and welcoming environment. I definitely recommend this gym!!!",

Me and my husband love love their childminding. Always attentive with our kids and the other kids. They have a huge womens only section and a clean womens changing and shower room. I like how they maintain cleancliness there too. I love how I can bring any friend or my husband for free with me at any time with the monthly plan I purchased. I always leave with a contentment working out here and I dont think Ill ever transfer to any other clubs. The only thing tho, I hope you can also have childminding @noon on Fridays.

Some days, as I fought Lyme disease, the workouts were super easy...no worries. It was what I could do that day. I do a number of sports like indoor rowing, triathlon, spin cycling, running, indoor rock climbing and open water swimming. The workouts help me in ALL disciplines. And for me, the trainers and the staff at this Goodlife feel like family. Its my go to place....feel 100% supported here.",

                "review_text": "I love this place! I was a GL member in Ontario and, when I moved to BC, I had to cancel my membership becasue there were not any locations here. It was an easy process and I spent the next few months trying different locations in the area to try and find a place that I liked as much. I finaly settled at one place and hated it so much that I barely went. I was SO happy to see a GL location here! I waited until I was able to cancel my membership with my other gym and I made an appointment with Louise to go over my options here. She was absolutely fantastic! Ive now been here for a few months and there is so much that I just love about this place. Here are a few highlights: 1. Great location. Think about it. Youre on your way home from work and you can hit the gym, grab that jug of milk that you needed from Price Smart and that prescription from Shoppers and not have to run all over the place doing it. 2. Gorgeous facility. GL has a ton of space with loads of new equipment. Every piece of cardio equipment has a little TV screen and an iPod/iPhone charger built into it. This means that the hour you spend sweating isnt boring and you also reduce the risk of dropping your iPhone because its attached to something. 3. Classes. The classes here are fantastic! There are a lot of free ones including Body Pump, Body Flow and Zumba. There is a seperate studio for spinning classes and those are free too. Yoga classes are in a much quieter area and are not included but are really not expensive. 4. Staff. I know that a lot of reviews here said that the staff are not good but Ive never had an issue with them and have always found them to be really nice. There are sales staff, customer service staff and trainers and they are all really professional and friendly. (As for the claim that they lied about cancelation fees - read the contract before you sign it because everything is in there. And if you keep your copies of the paperwork then its super easy to cancel things if you need to.) 5. The locker rooms. This might not seem like a big deal but when you have spent the last few years at a gym with rusty lockers, communal showers and not a single ammenity then this is a huge wow. The locker rooms are massive and nothing has been overlooked here. They provide irons and ironing boards, hair dryers, straighteners, curling irons, shampoo, conditioner, body wash etc right down to Q-Tips. There is a really nice sauna and there are two gorgeous little steam rooms in here too. I was really happy to see that there are about ten private shower stalls (and they are HUGE) because this means that I will never again have an old womans naked bum rub against me (that did happen and I was traumatized. True story!). 6. The training. I have not signed up for training here yet but I did go for the free consultation and Mike was great. He set up a workout schedule for me based on what I like to do and what I want to accomplish and he also gave me a lot of nutritional information. Ive already lost about ten pounds! 7. Motivation. GL offers optional workout cards that you can fill out when you complete workouts. They have a lot of incentives for people to get the results they want and everyone there is more than happy to do what they can to help members reach their goals (results = more customers). Definitely check this place out for yourself!",

                "review_text": "Dear Sarah, Its unfortunate that you failed to write the truth about your experience at Goodlife and with me. You neglected to mention that recording your workouts meant that you were actually filming them on your camera phone which goes completely against our member rules and etiquette, and you are also in breach of your membership. After politely asking you to stop filming the first time, you completely ignored my request. You continued to film and slam weights on several occasions (even after you asked my husband to step out of the way of your camera!) and I know for a fact that several other members and employees also had issues with you because they brought it to my attention. Sarah, our RPM group fitness instructor asked you politely to stop dropping the barbell (from waist high) as it was interrupting her class beside you when all the members continued to turn and look at you repeatedly. This was extremely loud and you were well aware of how it was disturbing other members. You just shrugged this off and didnt seem to care about how this was affecting others around you. Leila, our administrator also had a chat with you where she tried to explain the proper rules (all gyms are the same) but you didnt seem interested in hearing about it. You also said that when you signed up, the Fitness Advisor told you it was okay to film but when Leila asked who that advisor was, you couldnt give a name even though it is written on your contract. Simon, our manager is well aware of the situation and I can tell you this....after six years with Goodlife, never ONCE have I had a complaint against me. I know our rules and etiquette of the gym and slamming weights and filming are not part of them or any other gym. Since you claim to be a powerlifter perhaps its a blessing that you found another gym which specializes in powerlifting as Goodlife certainly doesnt fit your criteria. Good luck in your new gym. *Rachel....thank you for a refreshing review! We are working on connecting to wifi and should hopefully have it by the time you come back.",

The staff is very friendly and approachable if you have any questions and feedback on equipment etc. I would give this gym 4.5 stars only because they are missing a few key pieces of equipment but that s only if your the body builder kinda guy. But I did talk to them and they are planning on adding those pieces in the next couple years which is why I gave the 5 stars. One is the pendulum squat machine which is one of the best machines to add on your leg day to really focus on the quads better than any workout you can think of for the quads. The pendulum squat machine is very difficult to find in any gym so the fact that they re adding it is amazing. Another is a standing lateral raise machine, Some call it a Watson machine. Another is the standing T Bar Row, they do have the seated one, but it doesn t put you at the best angle but still workable. All in all a great gym if you can avoid the busy hours. Thank you Golds!!!",

Prices are fairly reasonable. Policy/protocol with Covid is consistent and overall, a clean gym. I cannot find dust anywhere. Mirrors are sparkling clean for those gym selfies! One of the cleanest green turf areas I have ever seen in a gym. Way to uphold the brand Golds Gym! Never been a member of any other gym.

It makes coming to the gym so comforting and fun knowing you re surrounded by professional and incredible people. The booking system is so easy and awesome. I have always been able to get the time slot that I want and am able to cancel up to 10 mins before the session. Very convenient!

As a long term member of another gym, I have to say that it was very weird making golds into my new home but its kind of warming up to me. the staff at golds are super nice. Although inconvenient with the whole time slot thing I like that golds has frequent times that they go around to clean and disinfect all the gear. I really like that the gym is very inviting for people that want to practice Olympic weight lifting as the platform, bars and plates are all eleiko branded. I hope one day the gym will once again be 24/7 with the showers! but we all take it one step at a time. overall its a really nice experience training at golds and I recommend it :)",

Due to covid, I havent had a gym membership in 2 years, but I miss Gym Life so I decided to get back into yearly Gym membership. I browsed several other gyms before checking out Golds Gym. From my friends referral I got to check out Golds Gym free for a day.  Honestly, Golds Gym was the best out of all the other gyms I checked out. I really like how West Broadway Golds Gym has new well-maintained clean equipment and the gym itself is clean. The gym has enough space that I can find a quiet space for myself to stretch before working out. The West Broadway staff are friendly, welcoming, and always helpful. The General Manager Noz is super sweet and nice, and she really cares about all the members. Noz is the best! I recommend you check out Golds Gym, It is definitely the best in Vancouver!!!! I hope they open a Burnaby location in the near future!!",

I ve gotten in every time I ve ever scheduled; you just have to look for last minute drop outs the day of. The capacity is 60 in the gym at a time. Big clean space. They sanitize the facility between each cycle of members. They also provide you with a spray bottle/sanitary wipes. They are keeping everything very controlled and clean while going thru this pandemic. I m super impressed with the level of care from the staff, and legitimate interest in getting to know us as individuals when we joined. Special shout-out to Nicole for always greeting us with a warm and friendly smile, asking us about our day/workout, and making sure everything is taken care of. Same with Noz.

She thought me to be consistent, patient and kind to myself. She believes in me even when I don t and always pushes me to the next level and to give more. I have seen a huge improvement in my body, my weight, my approach to the gym and my techniques since I am training with her.

We went well above the hour and he still took the time to show me some exercises I could do at home when I told him I had lower back pain. After 2+ years of doing weights thanks to John I realize that I was doing most of them wrong and that was probably the cause of my lower back pain. I would 100% recommend him, he is not only extremely knowledgeable and helpful but he is really passionate about fitness and helping people :)",

However, I feel that this location has done a great job. Staff are friendly, welcoming and accessible at all times for any of your needs. They are responsive both in person, and over the phone to answer any questions or concerns that may arise. The gym is spotless; it is evident that this location values the advice of the Ministry of Health and goes above and beyond the current COVID-19 guidelines. The gym has done its best to institute policies and practices that ensure that every member has the opportunity to have a safe, effective workout. The current guidelines not only hold their staff accountable, but also other members, making it one of the places that I feel the safest in our current state. I will definitely be recommending this gym to my friends and family. The facility itself is top notch, but it is really the staff that make this place excellent.

The free weights and machines are fantastic.... cardio equipment is the best I have ever seen and the assisted stretch area is amazing.  Its a wonderful family run business that has been anything but a cash grab from my experience.  Hopefully see you there for a workout :)",

The gym facilities are fantastic- Golds has everything you need to reach your goals including group classes when they re open. By far though, my PT Raven has had the biggest impact on my success. Not just for what she s taught me about form, new exercises tailored to my goals, and reaching fitness milestones along the way- but for the confidence I ve gained through the process. I ve had incredible physical results from the training, but more importantly was the change in my mindset. Raven taught me to set smaller achievable goals along the journey, find what drives me when I m motivated so I can lean into that when I m not, and that it s not perfection but progress and consistency that are key. Throughout my journey so far she s always been in my corner. More than that though, Raven also taught me to be there for myself.",

Theyve only recently allowed their members to enter without an appointed schedule which works better with my always fluctuating work hours. Enter when I want, exit when I want (although their busiest hours do have time restrictions. Thankfully that isnt a problem for me) But by far my most favourite thing is that it seems like they have an internal work joke, where the person at front has to go through a certain set of COVID 19 guideline questions (to ensure the safety of their customers) as quickly as possible. Auctioneer level speeds. Very impressive. But yeah, great variety of machines. Clean up after yourself. Maintain social distancing and youre happy as can be.",

I m no stranger to working out and I ve always been confident in my own ability to do it right, why would I need one? Mirthy has converted me. It s simple as that. I bought a package when i realized i wasn t really getting anywhere and if I was it was taking way too long. I chose him as my trainer because he is obviously invested in fitness (you have to see him to understand!). His knowledge, skill and drive have pushed me into working out the right way to get the results I want and need. He supports, re-focuses and guides. If you want results, he s your man.

My mornings are always positive thanks to Paiges smile and sense of humour. Ive also had the chance to take some personal training sessions in the last year with Natalie and I can see and feel a huge improvement in my overall look, stamina and mental heath since Ive started. Ive built some pretty solid friendships thanks to Golds. Im really happy I chose this gym 4yrs ago. I would highly recommend Golds Gym Langley to anyone looking to join or switch from another gym.",

The staff are super friendly too. It s so nice to be acknowledged by the trainers who first signed me up each time they see me in the gym. It makes me feel like they weren t just interested in signing me up, but are keen to be a part of my journey here. Also, there was no hard upsell of personal training packages, which is a major turn off in other gyms.",

As it got closer to 8:30am, and I was in the main machine area, there were still benches available when the gym started getting busier. I never had to wait for a piece of equipment.

Stefanie specifically has been no stranger to going above and beyond her work duties to assist gym members! I remember about a month ago I found myself in a troubling situation in the bathroom, unable to leave I called the front desk in tears. After explaining my issues, and without any hesitation she sprang into action, almost knocking the door off the hinges as she entered in an industrial hazmat suit. She came equipped with an arsenal of supplies and expeditiously eliminated any trace of the prior incident! Even after going above and beyond she still showed immense courtesy by giving me an air freshener for the trip home!! Overall amazing place and I would recommend it to any of my friends!",

I have been in a lengthy process of evaluating whether or not to commit to this gym and have been looking at other options (Fit4Less and Steve Nash are the close ones). I want to dispel any notion that Golds is run even remotely similar to the manner it was before. I had the pleasure of being accommodated by Scott and also some of the upper-management. They explained to me that there was a shift in mind-set and management culture recently after the owners (I assume?) realised that not all staff were handling customers well. They went from  (judging by the comments) pressuring, money-focused sales people to kind, friendly, non-pressuring advisers. I was given a 3 day pass (free) and then he gave me and my wife space to workout! No pressuring, no number-crunching right off the bat. Just freedom to feel out the gym. When I decided to sign up the manager who assisted me took the time to walk-through all the terms, and actually prioritized me understanding everything over getting it over it, she took her time, was friendly and ensured I was okay and on board before moving forward with every section. The contract was reasonable, competitive (compared to similar gyms, not discount gyms), and easy to understand. The locker rooms have had a huge upgrade, have lounging areas with TV;s, nice wood finish lockers, UV Saunas, and the equipment upstairs is well setup and lots of new and expensive equipment as well as the good-old free weights. Apparently they are going 24/7 soon... And getting proper crash-plates and Olympic pads... Time will tell, but even if they dont, I am so pleased with my experience. I walked out of there feeling like I just made a great decision, not feeling like I was talked into something and dumped after the bill. Would recommend any one to seriously consider this place. Its a luxury gym (not a rec centre or discount gym like Fit4Less), so dont complain about the price and compare it to those (No one shops for a Ferrari and complains it doesnt have a Civics price tag). But Steve Nash has been spamming my emails and phone non-stop since I checked it out and I felt like I was just a commission in my sales guys eyes. Go check it out. Experience the new Golds for yourself. You wont be disappointed.",

The ladies at the front desk are very friendly, some have even remembered my name- which I appreciate! I started going to Golds when my son was 3 months old and they won me over because of their a AMAZING childminding team, and care room. All of the caregivers are extremely kind and accommodating and from day one my son warmed up them all and loves coming to the gym. Now he is 1.5 years and to this day he is very comfortable here! MOMS AND DADS IF YOURE LOOKING FOR A FACILITY THAT HAS GREAT CHILDMINDING SO YOU CAN WORK OUT WITH A PIECE OF MIND, THIS IS IT! As for the rest of the gym, I have found over the last year and a bit of being here the gym has improved and they keep looking for ways to improve, constant cleaning and maintenance, different classes etc.. Thank you so much Golds Langley for making me love the gym!",

I was greeted by friendly staff who were genuinely interested in helping me achieve my fitness goals. They took the time to understand my needs and provided valuable advice without pushing me into any unnecessary commitments. It was evident that they genuinely cared about creating a positive and inclusive environment for all members. The equipment at this gym is also really good, with a ton of options. The cleanliness of the gym was commendable too, and I appreciated the staffs efforts in maintaining a hygienic space. One incident that really stood out to me was when I encountered a small issue with one of the machines. I approached a staff member and they walked with me to the machine right away and then told the maintenance team. I think what sets this gym apart from other places I ve been is really the positive and motivating atmosphere. The members here are friendly and supportive, creating a sense of community that is often lacking in other gyms. The trainers are approachable and always willing to offer guidance, making sure that you get the most out of your workout routine. To sum it up, despite the negative feedback, my personal experience has been nothing but positive. I encourage anyone who might have been skeptical like I was to give it a chance. You might just be pleasantly surprised, just like I was! Overall, I highly recommend Fitness World Kingsway to anyone looking for a gym that offers quality equipment, helpful staff, and a welcoming atmosphere.",

I would also like to give parinaa, the personal trainer there, a huge shoutout. As a beginner in the gym and not knowing much on how to get started, parinaa set me up really well with a proper routine that I can follow. Not only that, I was also set up with a well laid out nutrition plan for my goals. Through her guidance, I have finally been able to make progress as I was stuck on a plateau for far too long. Whenever parinaa passes by me in the gym, she will always make sure to check in with me and asks about my progress. Always gives me new tricks and tips to follow. Her words of encouragement are really very empowering. Her energy is what is needed for beginners like us to keep coming back to the gym. The managers and the staff there are also incredible. Great team and  a great facility. 10/10",

Yes, some members don t put their weights away. Yes, bathroom in womens area is permanently out of order. Yes, parking can be difficult during the peak hours after work. But, they did just open up a brand new section with like 10 squat racks. There s a bunch of new equipment that s been added. There s another bathroom 20feet away from the womans area that works perfectly fine. The showers work. The ventilation is way better than it used to be. The staff here is maybe the highlight, one of the nicest I ve ever seen and a ton of fun to banter with. The manager is always talking to members. If you just wait 5minutes for parking a stall opens up too. I think people need to have a little perspective in life and be a little less negative. It s the cheapest membership price in the entire city but they re expecting to be pampered like Equinox. That s my two cents.",

She has given me knowledge on nutrition and exercise every step of the way. I have learnt so much. Her method of progressing you slowly by building a strong base is commendable.

Fresh ideas. High creativity. Discipline. Exchange of positive energy and humor, as my body is tested and carefully broken, sculpted and rebuilt stronger and fresh.

Emilio is knowledgeable, has the required technical training experience and is overall a great human being!

Special thanks to my personal trainer Hailey! She is an inspiring, knowledgeable, and fun trainer. Hailey is good at explaining the instruction to help me easily to understand and make the training process interesting. She monitors our lifestyle, nutrition, and progress closely to adjust our program accordingly. Not only she is training our physical work out but also enhancing our mental health.  I ve been training with her for over three months, and she encourage me to believe in myself and build up my confidence. if you have any questions, she will respond you quickly even not in the work hours and she will give you more feedback above your expectations. You always can trust her! And the most thrilling thing to me is now I enjoy my workout and it become one of my favorite exercises.",

I wanted to start working out and become fit for a long time, but had issues committing and also: gym anxiety. TL;DR: Fantastic gym, even greater personal trainers! I decided to get a personal trainer to hold myself accountable. Hailey K. is a fantastic PT: she not only helps me with my workouts, but also guides my nutrition. She encourages me to push myself harder, and accommodates and understands my bodys limits. Furthermore, shes available to answer my questions outside of PT hours via text message, which is incredible! I really appreciate her hard work, and her fun, positive energy. Ive made progress in both my strength and my confidence by leaps and bounds since I started training with her (and committing to the gym!). As for the gym itself, its well-maintained and the staff are all very friendly. Ive never had any issues with the equipment. I was also able to reach out to the staff for help on some of the machines. This gym is at a great location, with a supplement store right next door. Its a walk away from both the mall, and transit (bus+train).",

Free guest parking is available as well (though not too big, so you might spend a while looking for a free spot during busy hours). The maximum subscription also includes the guest access option, when you can bring a friend with you for free (as many times as you want)! Plus, they offer 3 free admissions to try&see.

Fernando keeps me motivated at all times, he takes his time explaining the form of the exercises and keeps the workouts interesting by switching them up once every while. I am becoming more comfortable and confident with my body shape and strength, and I thank him for that!",

She really takes the time to get to know you and your body. My favorite aspect about working with Kat is that she tailors the program not only to my goals, but also in consideration of my physical weaknesses and my abilities. For example, we worked on improving my squat form because she noticed one of my legs have tighter tendons than the other. My form was better after day one! Kat is funny, energetic and above all super motivating! She has my absolute recommendation!",

During the Covid time, I gained so much weight and no exercise for years.. and without her help, I would have stayed the same. Her knowledge and her passion towards being healthy helped me so much not only to lose weight but also being healthy. Because of her, I ve got the courage to exercise,the healthy lifestyle and most importantly how to enjoy the workout!!!!! I am amazed how my body has been changed just by listening to HER. I had another personal trainer 5 years ago from different gym (not Fitness World) before I met Hailey. Not trying to compare, but I know for the fact that what I learned this time and before there are huge differences. She knows how to motivate ppl and that is super important especially if you are new to this. If you ever need a personal trainer, you should look for Hailey Kim. She is just amazing. Thank you so much Fitness World and Hailey",

She definitely helped push me out of my shell and I feel more confident in myself when it comes to heavier lifting now.

I first used the West Broadway facility before the UBC location reopened. The UBC location is great. It has everything I need. The staff are friendly. Not hard to register a spot (right now you need to make a reservation to workout), since the location isnt crowded. I think the company is doing pretty good considering the circumstances.",

He has a keen eye for assessing his clients fitness and effectively communicates long-term and short-term goals for his clients with realistic strategies to achieve them. He makes it easy to understand the reasons for each exercise and the metrics for keeping track of progress. He also has very clear explanations for correcting postures and avoiding injuries which are especially important for weight training. I am very happy with the quality of PT provided by Bryan and Golds Gym. As for the gym, it is very clean and offers a wide variety of equipment. The staff are very friendly and members are conscientious. I would highly recommend Golds Gym UMP for people interested in fitness and are either studying at UBC or living on campus.",

Both the staffs and clients are so friendly, making the entire environment comfortable. Talking about PT, I have been trained under Ariana s instructions for the past two months, and I absolutely love how professional and inspiring she is! I wasn t new to gym and I was trained under two different PTs before. Comparing my past and recent experiences, I think Ariana is the type of PT that truly spends time planning out systematic schedules to fulfill clients  needs rather than throwing random stuffs from days to days. Since day 1 of the training, she has already awaken my muscles and strength for compound exercises which were scheduled weeks later. She is able to provide easy-to-follow instructions and detail suggestions for further improvement. She definitely pushes me to challenge myself more. I couldn t be able to imagine how much I have accomplished within such a short period of time. I used to go to gym just for the sake of  health  and I struggled mentally every single time. However, I really enjoyed my times working out in the gym this two months, and even looking forwards to attending specific  interesting  sessions haha. Overall, if you are looking for a PT who is both professional and fun to talk with, I would highly recommend Ariana to you!",

I become more energetic everyday. She is so sweet and easygoing, and most of all, she is very caring of my experience. I would recommend her to anyone who is new to gyms or who is professional. Also, on the days I don t train with her, she would always instruct me via message. She would give honest opinions, motivates you, and gives recommendations on healthy diets. When the first time I went to Michelle, all I wanted what to lose weight. Right now, I want to build muscle and strength and look fit and healthy. She really changed my idea of a  perfect body . Overall, working out is fun and my body is becoming more fit and proportionate.

If you also consider to have a personal trainer, Ian Standish I suggest. He is one of their best trainers, I started working out with him since March 2019, and we made a lot of progress in the last 3 months. He is experienced and well organized. He keeps tracking on my strength and cares about how I feel through out the workout. He makes small changes to our workout every session  and encourages me to push harder. I have had a great experience here with these people,  and Im very excited to have my next body composition test on June 1st, and see how much progress I have made.",

UPDATED** Current letting 40 members in the gym at a time and no more booking system. Tap in with your fob and workout when you want! Live tracker is available on the website for each location. YOU CAN STAY up to 1 hours and 45 min during non peak times, 1 hours and 15 min during peak times. UMPs peak times run Monday-Thursday 12-730 pm and Friday Saturday after 12 until about 7. Sundays are mostly dead. Front desk staff track your workout time when you check in and will give you a heads up if they have a line waiting and you need to exit... You can always tap out, jump back in line and workout again tho. Cleaning is on point, compared to other facilities the team uses a cleaning log to ensure every 15 MINUTES different areas of the gym are sanitized. Its still mandatory to wear your mask inside, so come prepped with an active wear mask rather than a heavy cotton one. (you can buy viral off Golds Gym branded masks at the front desk) They also now sell a variety of Golds Gear, visit the website for more info and pics :)",

                "review_text": "Heres the deal... Ive lifted at UBC for the past two years without even so much as blinking an eye in the direction of Golds Gym. Today I stopped by for a personal training session with Bryan Wong (more on that later!), and was blown away by the gym. Super clean, tons of machines and weights, friendly staff... Overall, a super professional and fun environment! If youre looking for a gym with a little more space, a few more options, and a super motivating atmosphere - Golds is the place for you! The location is also super fantastic: super accessible (with amazing open hours) and conveniently located. I did an assessment with Bryan followed by a two-hour training session, and let me tell you... I am beyond DEAD! Bryan pushed me super hard, motivated me a ton, and gave me a plethora of unique pointers to utilize in my future lifts. I am super excited to incorporate what I learned with him into my routine and ultimately get stronger! Definitely work with him if you get the opportunity - you wont regret it and your muscles will be thanking you later (even if it hurts in the interim). Overall, I had such a positive experience at Golds Gym at UBC and would recommend it to anyone! Even if youre a bit skeptical, check it out! A drop-in session never hurt anyone - unless, you know, you like, actually injure yourself... (But with the super great staff present, thats not gonna happen! And also, know your limits and be safe.)",

It s good to have someone you look up to and Bryan is that person for me. Often between sets, or outside of gym, he gives me a lot of his wisdom and tips on fat loss, muscle building, nutrition or life in general. He always keeps me accountable on my goals and has instilled in me a lot of discipline. Highly recommend Bryan if you re looking for a personal trainer.",

The staff were happy to engage in conversations with me and helped me figure out a plan to insert fitness back into my life. A special thanks to Matthew and the other staff for helping this father of two find time for himself again :)",
