Apparently they rarely get cash so my refund of $170 was an issue. I received my money after being embarrassed for not preferring plastic cards over actual money.,6 years ago,2017-12-04 20:57:11.177659,"We are very sorry for your experience with our White Rock store. We contacted the manager of the store and he wants to personally apologize for the embarrassment or discomfort you felt while you were returning the microphone you purchased. We keep minimal cash in our registers for security reasons and because it had been earlier in the day we had not amassed any cash reserves. While that doesnt excuse the treatment you received, we hope that explains our situation a bit better. Again, we would really like to apologize for your experience at our White Rock location. Please dont hesitate to reach out to us at google@long-mcquade if youd like to discuss this issue further.

I went through the financing option with them and completed 90% of my payments, with hundreds left on a total principle of thousands. I changed my bank account from which the funds were being withdrawn, and thus missed payments. They called me to inform me and i told them i would come Friday February the 14th. The message was never relayed back to whomever and instead of following up again or emailing, an individual from the store showed up at my residence at 7pm on a Friday the 7th, disturbing my grandmas 75th birthday, demanding to repose one item i had mostly paid for.  Very unprofessional.",3 years ago,2020-12-04 20:57:11.183073,"Hi, we are very sorry to hear that you suffered this experience.
