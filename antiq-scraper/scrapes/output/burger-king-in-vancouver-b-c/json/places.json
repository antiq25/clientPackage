They both show passion for their job at Burger King, both show respect for customers, thank you Aman and Parminder for your excellent customer service and your sunshine smiley faces! (Even with the mask on, I can feel you two are smileing behind the mask), both show that they love their job. Keep up the good work! (Other crew members I don t know their name, I also would say a thank you so very much because they also show passion for their job here at BK and they also have fast and accurate service too!) . Everytime I get burgers and drinks here, I feel very welcomed by the friendly staff members here, and food is fresh hot and tasty, this drive thru shows how a real Burger King should be. I recommend food from here. The warm tasty burgers made by the crew members here, are like burgers made from their warm hearts! Keep up the excellent work! Cheers!",

                "review_text": "I cant believe I havent reviewed this Burger King yet. This place is legendary. If youre a super posh person who cant handle the real world, this Burger King isnt for you. That said, all kinds of people frequent this Burger King. Of course there are individuals, I know someone who got ripped off by an individual in this Burger King. There are also regular working people, office people, young people, and tourists. Usually they always have posters up for items that sold out long ago. They have a really large menu with a lot of customizability. I always found the staff to be nice and patient with me, even though I have yet to memorize the Burger King menu, and always need to read it when I get to the front. When youre standing at the front waiting for your food, it feels really tense, like a contest, because some things take forever, and you could get your food way earlier or way later than you expect. Not just anybody can use the bathrooms, they would be too prone to abuse in a location like this, the bathrooms are for paying customers only. No shenanigans. I like the music they play in here, its always pleasant. Generally 70s music with a leaning towards soul. The Angry Whopper is dope, I like that, I get it with no cheese because Im lactose intolerant. I want to try and see if they have any spicy chicken tenders or nuggets. This is a lively and fun establishment. To be honest, I like to go to Jollibee first and order a two piece chicken, eat that, and then smuggle the Jollibee gravy in my pocket and use it for the Burger King fries. I havent gotten banned yet. I usually go during off hours in the afternoons, and there are a lot of individuals. Right now Im here at lunch and it is very orderly and normal. Kind of disappointing, really. Vegetarian options: They have a vegetarian burger. Dietary restrictions: You can ask for no cheese. Wheelchair accessibility: Seems like you could make it through the double doors. Floor is flat.",

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone...the staff is amazing..especially the cheerful Philippine lady who always tries to make everyone happy and smile...easy to do when she allows me to buy strawberry sauce separately for my pancakes!!! Sometimes I gotta but a whole sundae but how kool is it that during breakfast hours u can get a sundae!!! Gotta love that...thats really having it your way!!! If thats what BKs slogan is...then they better continue to make it happen!!! If I was ever denied my strawberry   pancakes that would send my whole day into a tailspin!!! All thou theres always a selection or should I say cddscquite a collection of colorful people that frequent this location,..hey Im a proud East Van guy so u could say those kinda people are my kinda people...If ur from around here u get what I am saying! All the foods great...I tend to order allot of roadhouse burgers and whatever burger I chose...BBQ sauce and onion rings usually find their way onto them...oh yeah..how awesome is it that u can get onion rings instead of fries for no charge extra..that is what makes BK the best. My one complaint would b the increase of two dollars in only a year for the king meal Deal...that almost...well lets hope it stays at 7$ for a long time...to end this on a positive..go to bk and grab a cone..only a buck..and there wicked.",

My last visit they messed up my sandwich but thats ok we all mess up from time to time. Its all about how this error was handled and treated that means the most to me. They fixed it fast and with a sense of urgency I very much appreciated   there was no hassle about doing a  remake, they appologized and made a new one on the fly.  Thats how employee mistakes should be handled but rarely arenin this city   other restaurants in van could benefit from this obvious display of fantastic customer service!! Its def a hard thing to find lately.  Thanks BK for renewing my faith in customer service !! I wish I had the girls name , it happened last Fri, Nov 2,2018 during the early  evening hours  and she deserves a goodhuge applause!!",

The classic whopper sandwich contained with fresh vegetables, salty pickle and the fresh juicy taste of tomato. The classic whopper sandwich with processed cheddar cheese and the ounce of pure beef meat. The melted cheese in the meat combined with mayo ketchup and mustered.

No problem at the counter it was quiet. However within the following half hour 3 girls showed up and started to berate the young lady seving and demanded keys to the washroom    then the 3 young girls stated to harass clients  but seemed to be afraid in pestering the likes of me. It lasted over 45 minutes and only once another employee made her entrance back to the store did it escalate to a point the police was to be called within the next 5 to 8 minutes of sarcasm and fowl language they left. Sadly theses young ladies had nothing better to do then to harass the hard-working young girl who had remained  polite quiet and silent despite the repeated attempts to make her feel like a piece of s@$$%t . Knowing well enough the wages the staff earn doesnt equate the verbal abuse she had to endure. So please be patient be kind be safe  and I assure you that whenever I stop by that place I will ensure that I stopped by eat a bite Knowing that who served me, his truly an amazing person who deserves all of my gratitude for a job well done. BTW: the pouting is affordable and awesome. Burgers  as good as any fast food",
