When I couldnt find the desired 24 x 48 corrugated plastic sheets due to their unavailability, Scott came to my rescue. Despite only having larger 48 x 96 sheets in stock, he willingly offered to cut one in half for me, even though I didnt have any tools with me. Scotts helpfulness was refreshing, especially after encountering three other unhelpful employees. As my young daughter astutely pointed out, Scott was the only staff member who made us feel truly welcome. The management team at Home Depot should acknowledge and appreciate employees like Scott, as his outstanding customer service sets an example for his peers to follow.",

My husband and I ordered flooring from this store for our new place for an amazing price - it turned out there was an issue with the shipment, but the staff handled it with so much care and understanding. We were in touch with the manager Trinh, and Desmond, from the flooring department. They not only offered us new flooring at a better quality, but also offered it to us for the same price. We got lucky this issue was handled by such caring staff members. Thank you Burnaby Home Depot.",

They were great about the refund, no hassle. I was disappointed and so they offered to price match a similar model that they had in-stock. The ones they had in-stock were not what I wanted so I declined the offer. Alexander was awesome at really empathizing with my situation and I honestly felt he did everything he could to resolve the issue so I could leave as a satisfied customer. I ended up reordering the same unit and picked it up this weekend. It works great and I felt that Alexander went over and above for my repeat business.",

I used to occasionally buy paint from  this store years ago  but was never thrilled about it. The last time I was in, I was so impressed by the assistance from the group of gentleman that were working. Fred, Taylor and the Behr paints gentleman (I m sorry I can t remember his name) were so warm and funny. It was a truly special experience and one I sadly don t usually receive from customer service stores anymore but wow, they really went above and beyond with helping me choose the right products and offered unbiased opinions. other stores should take a lesson from what excellent service looks like as I will certainly be coming back regularly. Thank you Burnaby Home Depot Paint!",

A rep name Kyle (fawcett dept) checked to see if there was anymore in the store and other stores and then offered to price match another similar item.

I had already visited 2 competitor stores, and they seemed to carry cordless only.  Since I already owned 2 cordless, including one of the coveted and expensive Dysons, which lasts 10 minutes from fully charged to a sudden zero; then a subsequent 2 hours to charge and then another 10 minutes of working.  Jay  checked the department and found only cordless, but concluded that some corded machines were available online.  To confirm this, she checked with  Sarah  from that department. I was already happy to return home to order. Jay then said that she would check online to ensure that it was in stock. It was indeed, and since she had the product on the screen, informed me that I could order it then and there,  if I wanted to, and have it delivered free of charge to my home.  Jay started the order, and Sarah completed it.  I was impressed with 2 staff members going out of their way to make sure that I had what I wanted.  Thank you, Jay and Sarah!",

He did all this while also helping out a group of probably five other customers waiting and was calm and professional throughout.

My car was too small to fit the big box , Yak was able to arrange fast shipping, and I was able to get it the next day . I was not sure about this set, and Yak gave me his honest opinion. The set is high quality  and very comfortable.  I love it.  Thank you, Yak and his team.  Highly recommend homedepot, especially this location.",

Thank you so much to Glenn from the bottom of our heart; Glenn was kind, patient, and helpful everytime my father came into the store to ask questions. It was challenging for my father to converse and speak proper English as English isnt his first language . Glenn didnt just give simple replies; he listened patiently, researched several times and wasnt willing to give up. Finally, he was able to find the exact one for us and gave my father all the information he needed. Thank you for your outstanding customer service Glenn, my father has never met someone as dedicated to customers as you are. You really made his day! I hope your hard work doesnt go unnoticed by the management and the company. Home Depot is lucky to have an employee like you. Thank you thank you thank you we really appreciate you.",

The client called customer service to explain the situation. The returns staff Fred and Mostafa were absolutely amazing, professional, and efficient. Lester helped me move the items from my car to the store. I was in and out of there in less than 15 minutes!

Apart from the Warehouse size supplies for every DIY project under the sun, their online shopping usually offers either free delivery or free pick-up from the Store and offers an even wider range of products. The really neat thing is that unlike online only retail outlets, I can take any problematic item directly back to our closest Home Depot and theyll take it from there - no need to organize with Courier Services for any return items.

We decided to look at appliances, since we need to replace a few. Long story short: an extremely knowledgeable and very pleasant staff member named Brian showed and explained to us in understandable English the properties of the different machines. I have been treated like a little dumb old lady whose biggest concern is the color scheme elsewhere. A big thank you to Brian for sharing all the info with us. For example: I seem to be shrinking and have to put my upper half inside the my current washer to take out the laundry, feet off the ground. I cant wait for my front loader! We feel confident that we got a fantastic deal. Please let Brian know how much we enjoyed the experience. Go Brian!! 5 out of 5 or 10 out of 10.",

We had a bathroom renovation and Larry was the most knowledgeable, kind and helpful to work with. We had ran into a problem when an item we bought was discovered to be faulty after the installation which makes things a bit complicated. Again Larry was extremely helpful and with Susana provided us with a solution that we greatly appreciated. Renovation can be a very stressful time for home owners and when you ran into problems it is even more difficult. Thats when the Home Depot stuff was a god sent to us with their caring approach and excellent service! Highly recommended!",

This Home Depot is really massive and has a huge plant and outdoors section as well as a huge warehouse that is oftentimes well stocked. There is no shortage of customer service agents as well to provide good advice. They have a pickup facility for online orders as well. There is a large contractor area and lumber and building supplies section. Overall, if you are looking for a tool or part or decor for your house, this is the place to find it.  There is a McDonalds across the parking lot if you are feeling like needing a break and a Lordo and Staples across from that to get the rest of your supplies for the home.

We didnt know where to start and were overwhelmed. Then the assistant store manager, Mario Dedios connected me and my wife with the Pro Desk at Home Depot Richmond. Myron and Susanna helped us tremendously and made the process very pleasant, with flawless efforts. They went out of their way and beyond to accommodate our work schedules and even did overtime to help. We never experienced this much quality services at any Home Depot location in our lifetime (We are in our late 40s). Myron brought in many associates from different departments to provide us as accurate information as possible and also in a timely efficient manner as possible. The Pro Desk supervisor, Mark Wong, also gave us critical advice with purchase timing and delivery efficiency. Special thanks to Myron who oversaw all the packing process for days until the shipments left the store and didnt even rest on his day off but called us from home to make sure all the shipments arrived safe and sound. I would recommend Pro Desk Team at Home Depot Richmond to anyone who is planning in bigger projects than just regular minor DIY jobs. They are better than excellent, like they never sleep until you receive your orders. Thank you Pro Desk team!",

We provided a color code we saw on the paint manufacturer website, but it turned out to be the wrong shade after it was mixed (screen and real life doesnt match). Tiffany took the effort to try to fix that for us by manually calculating the difference in dye needed to match what we wanted instead of just telling us to buy another one. At that time we were satisfied with the new color so we bought it, but back under our home lighting we decided that the color still wasnt right so we went to a nearer Home Depot to get the correct shade (we had the actual swatches this time!). We told the paint associates there what we were trying to do and they told us it wouldnt work, and that Home Depot didnt carry that type of paint, which confused us. We called up Tiffany, and she did extra legwork to confirm for us that the paint type we originally got was correct and it would work. On top of that, she went above and beyond and called us back to tell us that a better quality primer was on sale, and put aside one can for us. She took time to explain things to us despite it being a very busy time at the store. She provided great customer service and made our visits to Richmond Home Depot very pleasant!",

We had to disassemble it ourselves with no instructions as it was the last model, but they assisted in every way possible by offering us tools. The customer service shown was just great during the whole process. I ended up buying another Gazebo as a gift as the whole transaction was super pleasant.  Andrea had literally 8 different customers at the same time along with staff questions,  but still managed to find time to check in on us which was greatly appreciated. Super awesome work guys!",

The only down side was when we received our Fridge, there was 2 small dents; one on each side of the french doors. Sid Moosavi, that works in appliances was the one that helped us from the time of purchase. He was very helpful and resolved the issue immediately. I enjoyed the experience of purchasing with Home Depot. 10/10 would recommend and will definitely purchase at this location again.",

Took it back to home depot and also brought my cabinets in with me and explained the situation to Ken Nguey and Saksham. They quickly identified that I needed a much stronger staple gun to perform the repair so instead of charging me for one, they took one from the rental section and helped me repair my shelves on the spot as it required an air compressor which i didnt have access to either. My shelves are fully repaired now and I am extremely happy with the service I received. Keep up the good work guys!",

A big thank you to Lucy for going above and beyond to help solve some of my kitchen problems. She answered all my questions and was very creative in solving my renovation design issues. There s a Home Depot that s closer to my house. I drive the extra 5km because the service (Lucy/Emily) and product range far surpasses all other HD locations in the lower mainland. Customers appreciate honest and expert advice. I hope head office acknowledges employees. Show your customers corporate is listening and values our feedback.  I d like to shop at a store that values its staff. So Please do that. People matter",

My plan was to rent the drill, do the job there and then and then turn it back in. The guy who helped me was Ken. He was a super nice guy. Not only did he not charge me for the drill, he drilled all the holes for me while I held the box in place! You just dont get that kind of service or total customer service attitude much anymore and I really appreciated it. It meant a lot to me. I go to that store a lot and this just made me feel even better about the place. Thank you very much for your help, Ken! Youre a good guy and Home Depot is lucky to have you! Derek",

Im quite handy and know how to fix a lot of things and am often spoken down to buy male associates especially but these two associates worked very hard to troubleshoot this with me and I am sorry to all the other customers because I did dominate their time but they solved a huge problem for me and Im forever thankful.",

Even an item that was thought not to be on the shelf, Kevin took the extra mile, brought out a large ladder and found it for me in no time. I really appreciate your help Mr. Kevin! God bless you.

I ended up following this advice and bought a new faucet where I was also welcomed and advised properly on the right product to purchase and the assurance that it would fit the existing place.

We moved here about 2 years ago and were held hostage by Home Depot because we ordered special hardwood flooring and were told to wait until there was installers available. We waited for close to 1 month, and our flooring was just sitting there waiting for installation. We couldnt do anything until we had the flooring installed   so finally,  we picked it up ourselves and had someone,  who did a fabulous job, install it for us beginning the day after we contacted him. Finally,  we decorated our new home and didnt have to be camping in our home any longer. Two weeks later,  we got a call from Home Depot advising that they still didnt have an installer available but should have one in about 2 weeks. The person who called actually got upset when we told them that we had it installed by someone who was available.!!! I can honestly say that I have never seen such bad service from any operation, especially considering that we bought top of the line flooring and have spent a lot of money at Home Depot both in Vancouver and now here. We continue to shop there, but know enough not to try to find any service & find what we need on our own. That being said,  Home Depot have an excellent selection and their prices are very reasonable. Just dont expect much in the customer service area.",

If not for him, I would have brought them home and set them up wrong, resulting in failure to work and thus a return on the product. I appreciated the extra help immensely as we really need the product working now not later and also being in a wheelchair to have to make a waste of extra trips only to find out it was my misuse, for a question I didnt know to ask, I am very grateful. It being my first time in the store, it was also nice to be in store that is definitely wheelchair friendly. Considering how fast the staff member came to ask if I needed help, I know that had I not had someone with me, I wouldnt have had to wait or go searching for anyone to help me reach anything either. Love the really wide aisles!! If the store had been busy I probably still wouldnt have felt like I was in the way of people or worrying about taking knuckles out to get passed others  .",

After repeated visits to the Home Depot on Cambie, I feel compelled to share my experience.  The level of customer service at this particular  store is nothing short of outstanding.  I was assisted by Ana Baya and Quentin Millet.  They were both friendly, professional, and highly competent.  They listened to me explain what I needed and they showed a real desire to get everything done properly.  In an era where such fantastic personal service seems to be disappearing, Ana and Quentin have given me hope that there are still people who care about competence and professionalism.  This Home Depot has earned my business long into the future and I wholeheartedly recommend this business to anyone and everyone.",

When I got home and opened it there was actually nothing in the package.  Later in the day I was headed to Cambie street to grocery shop and thought that I d try returning the empty package for one with a bulb.  I anticipated that I may not get a return on the empty package due to it being a different HD location as well as it depending on their discretion.  Not only did I get an apology for the empty package; I also received a refund AND a new bulb.  It wasn t until I was on the drive home that I realized I hadn t asked the employee his name.  I m assuming that he was the manager-listed on my receipt as AJ Fraser.  Whoever you were-THANKS AGAIN.",

As it turned out, the self service machine didnt have the blank key I needed so the associate had use the manual machine. His customer service was great. Prices of comparable merchandise at Canadian Tire is probably priced a little better. footnote: The key that the automatic machine cut is really poor- barely works.

There was plenty of stock for the product I was looking for whereas it was sold out it a few stores closer to me. Just be aware that this store, being smaller, I believe doesnt carry lumber and other building materials. They do have a great selection of everything else.

However this one has a fantastic location and the staff ratio is a bit better than other places meaning you can usually get more help if you need it. However some of the more detailed departments like electrical and plumbing dont have quite the level of experience as other Home Depots do. But of course that depends on the time and day that you were going. I shop here at least twice a week and in general its well-stocked in all departments unless you need lumber or bigger outdoor stuff. The tool and paint department are especially amazing and have high-quality staff. Not to say that other departments dont... But theyve been exceptional in my ongoing home rental. Parking below is $3 but they comp you $3 off your bill when you check out if you ask. If you need to pick up bits and pieces of things and arent driving, its only one block from the SkyTrain line which makes it exceptional for a lot of people in their daily commute. Hats off to this location!",

Thanks so much for your kind service today, Arthur.",

It is wedged between save on foods grocery store and a Winners HomeSense furnishings store. Across the street is A BC liquor commission and Whole Foods and  Canadian tire as well as Best Buy are along the same strip. You can certainly spend the entire day in this area getting everything you need and running all your errands in one place. The Home Depot itself is always immaculately clean, And as usual with the Home Depot stores has a typical layout. This particular store does not have a contractor section so you ll have to go to another location if you re looking for building supplies such as lumber or other building materials. This location as well staffed and seems to cater to the small home renovation DIY as well as the casual home shopper. The stock is actually very good and it carries a lot of seasonal inventory. Despite Covid times, the hours of operation are actually pretty typical and all of the standard Covid precautions are in place and well laid out.  Come here pretty much every weekend for one thing or another.",

On two occasions, the staff has gone above and beyond and offered excellent customer service. I had to fix a baseboard that was ruined by my dog, and Dieter, I believe his name was, offered to cut the piece to the required measurement.  He even brought it to his home to cut the angle properly, and brought it back the next day for me. Just the other day again, I went back to  look for a patio set. Peter was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this Home Depot location.",

Whenever I ve come here for whatever product I find the staff very helpful, the prices are much cheaper than other places and they have a huge selection. Now that the garden works store in North Vancouver is closed I came here and discovered that they have the BEST  prices on their huge selection of pots, flowers, soil etc. They do need to change their entrance though. For those with disabilities it s a huge pain to go all the way around to one entrance. It makes more sense to have multiple entrances to welcome people into the store.",

This branch is a mini store because the local authority doesnt allow them to sell lumber, drywall etc.  However they still have most things. Of great importance is the quality of the team.

Heiter is a kind and attentive  cashier who is mindful and caring for the company. Salvatore knows everything about everything in construction,  or it appears that way to customers.  He helps and guides equally well in tools, electrical, plumbing, tiling.  Its a pleasure to meet him. Thank you Home Depot.",

Centrally located at the Main Street intersection across from Simons, Home Depot - Park Royal carries a comprehensive array of quality products for all aspects of your home renovations conceived, and yet to be imagined. Update:  20th July 2022 Seasonal Outdoor Garden Centre: Home Depot at Park Royal Village has an Outdoor Garden Centre (open approx. early-April - September) which is located behind the store building.  Ample parking is available, in addition to carts for loading up flowers, plants, ceramic pots and supplies. I hadnt made a visit to H.D. Garden Centre since before Covid struck 2 years ago, but needed to replace an area of flower bed in back garden which had been planted, but which slugs had completely obliterated. The July Clearance has already begun but there are still very good quantities of ornamental Annuals, Perennials and Shrubs as well as a wide array of supplies (e.g., soil, fertilizer, slug bait [ yes, lol ;) ], patio ceramic pots and more) to be had. Awesome location, top-notch store and people. Highly recommended.",

I also noticed that everyone on that day was helpful. An employee named Telis (maybe spelt wrong) was really knowledgeable about patio cleaners.
