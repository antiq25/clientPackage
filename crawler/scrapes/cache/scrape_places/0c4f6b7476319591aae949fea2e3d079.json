Then after asking them 5 times to make ours they only give us 17 nuggets, 2 honey sauce, spicy habanero sauce, and did not take out the onions from the burger. Also did not receive our root beer and the staff would just ignore us when we would ask politely. My friend is deathly allergic to onions too so she wasn't able to have her burger. I understand it was crowded but that is no way to go about our order. Horrible customer service and I'm very disappointed by this location.

The service at times can be poor and seems that employees enjoy chit chatting instead of taking orders, you know, working. Hence I stood there for 4 mins before was helped, with someone cutting in front of me beforehand I might add. Seems that the location must be a training ground.",

Here's a balanced review highlighting the key points:\n\nPositive:\nMenu Variety - McDonald's offers a diverse menu with plenty of options. Whether it was classic favourites or new additions, there were choices to suit different preferences and dietary restrictions.\n\nNegative:\nSlow Service - This particular McDonald's service could have been faster. It took longer than expected to place my order and receive my food. Improved efficiency during peak hours would enhance the overall dining experience.\n\nNegative:\nAtmosphere Concerns - The atmosphere of the restaurant fell short of expectations. The seating area appeared unclean, and the floors were scattered with food and drink spills. This lack of cleanliness created an unhealthy and uninviting environment.\n\nPositive:\nFamiliarity and Convenience - McDonald's consistency in its menu and service can be comforting for customers seeking a familiar dining experience. Additionally, its convenient locations make it easily accessible for a quick meal.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to McDonald's in Vancouver had ups and downs. While the menu variety and familiarity were positive, the slow service and cleanliness issues detracted from the overall experience. I hope the management takes note of these concerns and takes steps to improve service efficiency and maintain a cleaner and more inviting environment for customers.",

Had to go to washroom first as I have some health issues and needed to wash my hands before I eat. As normally ppl should. Staff didn't want to let me in with an excuse that the maintenance is in progress. No one was doing maintenance they just simply decided to close to the washroom for the night. This kind of behaviour should be illegal as it is a restaurant and restaurant bylaw says clearly you need to provide washroom when ppl eat in. Hope they will not behave like this towards anyone else in the future. Managers name that night was Jenny. Hope the top management will sort this out. I will visit again to see if the behaviour towards customers improved. Then will revisit my review.",

I take out the food and proceed to open up my burritos to add salsa inside.  Right away I noticed that the wrap seems soggy, I open it and the eggs and meat inside look wet.  I take a bite and it tastes fine.  Then I take my first sip of coffee and that tastes off.  I'm hungry so I eat my food.....  Then in around a half hour I start to feel light headed and sick to my stomach.  Then 15-20 minutes later I find myself puking and sitting on the toilet for a while.  It's now 8 hours later and my stomach has still been a mess.  No idea what happened, I've had this same breakfast so many times and it's never done this to me, so I guess I'm posting this to say if it looks or tastes off don't eat the food.",

Asked to change the hot fries with no salt and complained I had been waiting for my food over 30 mins.  The manager gave an attitude, \"it is not my problem, we were busy\", I said \"so is that my problem? you are the manager on duty and not responsible the human power?\"  She turned around and shout \"it's not my problem, give her something hot\".  I am patience enough to wait more than 30 mins for FAST FOOD and I deserve to receive this kind of \"Customer service\"????  The manager was trying to hide when I was taking her picture for evidence.  And other manager on duty was trying to cover her and asked me am I using human right.  There is nothing to do with human right but I was not treated right.  I brought it up to McDonald Headquarter about the incident I experienced at this location and asked for refund coz I threw them away.  The headquarter told me this restaurant manager would contact me within 10 business days but I never receive any phone call or email.  I received 2 meal coupons from Headquarter as a refund.  I will never ever come back again.  P.S. This restaurant is always full of garbage everywhere and no one was doing cleaning.",

I've ordered chicken nuggets from there twice now and both times they've come so stale and gross I can't even eat them. This last time I got their food there was also MOLD on my fries! Unacceptable, no matter what restaurant you're running.\n\nOn top of that, they also state they are open 24 hours, yet they shut their indoor dining down at 6pm most days and only allow mobile ordering which is extremely frustrating if someone wants to use cash or for elderly people who are not as experienced in technology but would still like something to eat.\n\nOverall, no matter how desperate you get, go elsewhere. You won't regret not spending your money here.",
