Had to go to washroom first as I have some health issues and needed to wash my hands before I eat. As normally ppl should. Staff didn't want to let me in with an excuse that the maintenance is in progress. No one was doing maintenance they just simply decided to close to the washroom for the night. This kind of behaviour should be illegal as it is a restaurant and restaurant bylaw says clearly you need to provide washroom when ppl eat in. Hope they will not behave like this towards anyone else in the future. Managers name that night was Jenny. Hope the top management will sort this out. I will visit again to see if the behaviour towards customers improved. Then will revisit my review.",

This is not a one-time deal; they're the nearest McDonald's and as a busy student on a budget I end up here once in a while. No matter what time of day, even if they aren't busy, you'll end up getting parked to wait for your food when going through drive thru, even for a small, basic order, and sometimes end up sitting for upwards of 10 minutes. \"Fast food\", woo! There's never any greeting at the drive thru mic, you drive up and sit there waiting for several minutes without so much as a \"hello\" or \"be right with you\". Today, I received two \"sausage\" egg McMuffins with no sausage on either. Great... to summarize: terrible, slow, inaccurate, impolite and no end in sight. Not to mention their nightmare of a parking lot.",

Since it (the bag) seems so light when the staff passed it to me, I parked my car and checked. It was so ridiculous thats nothing inside in both muffins.\n\nI went back to the restaurant and letting them know. They seems didnt believe me and asked \"You got it with nothing??\".

It looked really gross and another thing was it felt like it was in the freezer and it was defrosting and they gave it to me. It looks like a disaster. It was so disgusting looking at it. I ended up throwing it out into the bush for the birds to eat and I feel bad for them and my coffee. I just dumped it out and just went over to Tim Hortons after and I actually got a hot coffee and a really nice muffin way to go McDonald's anyways everybody have a wonderful day thank you for taking the time to read this",

And when you refuse to be parked you get even worse service because now you are going against the normal, it's a drive thru and I should have to pull over and wait. While I sat and waited for my order 6 to 7 vehicles were parked so they can make their time for drive thru.  Truly terrible management for thinking this is acceptable to treat customers like this.\n\nAfter receiving my order my fry level is laughable. Ordered junior McChicken extra mayo and received my mcchicken with no mayo\n\nHow do you mess that up.\nCompletely unacceptable.\n\nCorporate McDonald's needs to review this location and it's management for customer service and drive thru operations.",

Here's a balanced review highlighting the key points:\n\nPositive:\nMenu Variety - McDonald's offers a diverse menu with plenty of options. Whether it was classic favourites or new additions, there were choices to suit different preferences and dietary restrictions.\n\nNegative:\nSlow Service - This particular McDonald's service could have been faster. It took longer than expected to place my order and receive my food. Improved efficiency during peak hours would enhance the overall dining experience.\n\nNegative:\nAtmosphere Concerns - The atmosphere of the restaurant fell short of expectations. The seating area appeared unclean, and the floors were scattered with food and drink spills. This lack of cleanliness created an unhealthy and uninviting environment.\n\nPositive:\nFamiliarity and Convenience - McDonald's consistency in its menu and service can be comforting for customers seeking a familiar dining experience. Additionally, its convenient locations make it easily accessible for a quick meal.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to McDonald's in Vancouver had ups and downs. While the menu variety and familiarity were positive, the slow service and cleanliness issues detracted from the overall experience. I hope the management takes note of these concerns and takes steps to improve service efficiency and maintain a cleaner and more inviting environment for customers.",

Compared to others, yes needs better management I don't go here often but every time I do it's much slower than others. Last time they told me to park my car for 2 cheeseburgers. I said no its fine. I don't mind waiting here, I said nicely. I rolled up my window and sat there on my phone. They had a long line in drive through. My burgers came within 30 seconds. Lol I hate it I dunno y they make me wait most times for a normal order. I'm not ordering the pizza or anything out of the ordinary. So loophole just hold the line up. LOL THEY HAVE TO PRIORITIZE YOU AND GET THE LINE MOVING. And as I was taught. The customer service. It's a virus. If ONE person has bad service it can spread, possibly this someone who has been there a long time with seniority? I do believe it can trickle down. Well if he's being lazy then I'm being lazy.

Compared to others, yes needs better management I don't go here often but every time I do it's much slower than others. Last time they told me to park my car for 2 cheeseburgers. I said no its fine. I don't mind waiting here, I said nicely. I rolled up my window and sat there on my phone. They had a long line in drive through. My burgers came within 30 seconds. Lol I hate it I dunno y they make me wait most times for a normal order. I'm not ordering the pizza or anything out of the ordinary. So loophole just hold the line up. LOL THEY HAVE TO PRIORITIZE YOU AND GET THE LINE MOVING. And as I was taught. The customer service. It's a virus. If ONE person has bad service it can spread, possibly this someone who has been there a long time with seniority? I do believe it can trickle down. Well if he's being lazy then I'm being lazy. Monkey c monkey do.",

This makes no sense to me I've never been to a restaurant where you're willing to pay for a product and they say no to you especially if it's just WATER. Especially when you're spending 30 to $40 each time just for two people you would expect better service. I hope management gets involved in actually makes a difference and teaches these people customer service it seems that customer service has gone down the drain. The employees act annoyed to serve you. It's super sad. I miss the good old days of good customer service. Not a Karen just want basic customer service.",

That means oil wasn't hot enough or they didn't drain them good enough to push the orders out.  I hate when I hand to try and peel the paper off of my hash. Sausage and egg mcgriddle seemed a lot greasier than other locations I go to and I've been to other super busy locations.\n\nYes it's McDonald's and it's not healthy but I don't need grease dripping all over me while I'm trying to eat.",

Asked to change the hot fries with no salt and complained I had been waiting for my food over 30 mins.  The manager gave an attitude, \"it is not my problem, we were busy\", I said \"so is that my problem? you are the manager on duty and not responsible the human power?\"  She turned around and shout \"it's not my problem, give her something hot\".  I am patience enough to wait more than 30 mins for FAST FOOD and I deserve to receive this kind of \"Customer service\"????  The manager was trying to hide when I was taking her picture for evidence.  And other manager on duty was trying to cover her and asked me am I using human right.  There is nothing to do with human right but I was not treated right.  I brought it up to McDonald Headquarter about the incident I experienced at this location and asked for refund coz I threw them away.  The headquarter told me this restaurant manager would contact me within 10 business days but I never receive any phone call or email.  I received 2 meal coupons from Headquarter as a refund.  I will never ever come back again.  P.S. This restaurant is always full of garbage everywhere and no one was doing cleaning.",

The service was great, with attentive staff who were knowledgeable and helpful with providing recommendations. The food was amazing!  The chicken were juicy and flavorful! However, they are still a bit spicy for me even though I ordered plain.  We loved the halloumi cheese and that yummy egg dessert too!!! Plus the cozy ambiance added an extra touch of comfort to the dining experience. Highly recommended!",

My daughter was sad they the kids meal was served in a regular bag not the box but she loved the toy. It was our first time trying the Poutine which was hot and tasty the McDouble was a little cold but mot messy like other times.  The staff were friendly. We will go back again next time.",

Unfortunately, to my dismay, they were out of apple pies during my visit. It was quite disappointing as it's a signature item that I always look forward to when visiting McDonald's.\n\nThe absence of the apple pie made me reconsider my order, and I ended up getting a refund, which didn't quite hit the spot. I understand that inventory issues can happen, but it's disappointing when a staple item like the apple pie is unavailable.\n\nOn the positive side, the rest of the meal was as expected from McDonald's - tasty and satisfying. The service was relatively quick, and the staff was friendly. However, the lack of apple pies did put a damper on the overall experience.\n\nI hope McDonald's takes note of this issue and ensures a more consistent supply of their signature items in the future to avoid similar letdowns for other customers.",

Then his butter packet was warmed up with the muffin...you can see the foil at the edges burnt up....he had to go back and tell her, no apology. Ruined our afternoon.

They didn't answer their phone at all when we called. It went to an answering machine that that didn't have a voicemail. So disappointing. What happened? My daughter loves it when we go to McDonald's after school  You pretty much know what you're going to get. The drinks are cold and refreshing. We were surprised that they still had plastic straws.  The filet o fish was fresh and tasty but it would have been better with more sauce and the sandwich especially since we asked for it and the fish was dry. We were really looking forward to the  the fries but they did not taste fresh and were cold  Most restaurants have meatless options being that they are the largest fast food chain you would think they would to. We will probably be back soon for ice cream ",

She looked at me like \"who cares\" and her other staff ignored me again. I had to basically tell them to open the door and  when I told Mindy she was rude she started arguing with me and talking to me as if we were in a brawl. Completely unprofessional for a \"manager\" to act this way! She argued with me and even customers were shaking their head at what she was doing. When someone needs to use the bathroom it should not matter what the reason is. I did not need to explain to her that my mother is handicap and is unable to go up the stairs. I have never been to this location but I do have to say it's one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Mindy needs management skills training. Horrible experience! The best part is when you complain to their upper management they always say \"will look into it\" and nothing gets fixed or done. Upper management will read this and do absolutely nothing and continue on because that's what McDonald's management do \"nothing\".",

I went inside and stood at the counter and waited for my order. There's no lineu, there's only one order on the order screen, which was mine. There's nobody at the till, there's a couple cooks in the back mopping and a lady up front mopping. After a few minutes the lady up front sees me and then tells the cooks that there's an order up. The cooks say something I couldn't understandand and disappear around the corner. I assume that they're going to finish baking my cookies. Fresh baked cookies, yay, I mean why else would I be waiting around this long for six cookies? They were in the oven baking. No doubt.\n\nBut they weren't. They weren't in the oven baking. After about 7 or 8 minutes another young lady comes out from, I guess the break room, and asked if I've been helped. I'm like \"yeah I placed an order a while ago.\" She looks at the till and then reaches under the counter and grabs me six cookies and hands them to me. And, oh yeah, they weren't chocolate cookies either, they ran out. They were the chocolate chip ones. So I wait around for almost 10 minutes for six cookies, and they weren't even the right ones. The complacency at this McDonald's was unreal. I have to laugh honestly it was so bad it was comical. The girl who came in at the end who actually got me the cookies I will say, was doing her job correctly as far as I can tell..\n\nI decided to get cookies here because I was picking up an Uber eats order. Except they told me I had to cancel the order because the customer ordered things from the evening menu and it was now on the breakfast menu. So I had to text the customer and let them know I can't pick up her order because they can't make it and I'll have to cancel. And I canceled. My question is why does this McDonald's have items on their Uber menu that customers can't order? Every McDonald's I've ordered from will have either breakfast items on the menu or their lunch and evening items on the menu. Fix your Uber menu. This is crazy to me also how someone can be on break and literally know other employee in the restaurant looks at orders or prepares orders. Like don't you have a protocol for like, you know, knowing when orders come in? And getting the customers their food?",

I went up to the counter to ask how long as people who ordered after me were getting their meals and let's be real 18 minutes for two items at McDonald's is beyond ridiculous. Was ignored by several employees. Finally got the attention of one of them and was treated poorly as if I was lying. 20+ minutes for two items is ridiculous. The food was awful, no lettuce, super soggy. This place needs new management immediately as it clearly shows the staff they have now were not trained properly and cannot handle the work load (wasn't busy at all). You go to McDonald's and don't really expect top notch service etc but this was baffling.",

No one wants to touch the handle after washing your hands it is not sanitary and no napkings are still not provided at Mcdonalds no 2 . LEAVE A LIKE IF YOU AGREE. This NO 2 Mcdonalds makes the absolute worst fries of any mcdonalds ive been to, always undercooked or overcoooked, never fresh taste stale, clearly the staff cooks alot of fries at once and does not throw out after the designated time and also is not cooking the correct time consistently i constantly get like 10 of the fries extremely soft undercooked or a few black burnt. Also they short you on fries . Large fries always is never full to top aswell as medium!  The Oreo mcfleury never has enough icecream,  oreo or amount of extras, burgers are usually cooked well but sometimes after 6pm or night especially quarter pounder, cheeseburgers etc it is undercooked or has no taste.  Breakfast they do well, hashbrowns always fresh however ive notice sausage and egg bread is sometimes burned black or hard maybe adjust the toaster?? The coffee never taste really good i usually get 2 cream one sugar and it taste like nothing. The bathroom is a horrible, extremely heavy door with no automatic button!  literally everyone is touching the same handle to get in and out, disgusting!!  a foot handle would make the difference and is much needed or replace the door you make enough money common guys, or automated door... or at the very least leave paper towel so staff and visitors can at least grab door with handle and throw in a nearby garbage like every other store!!!  so not every is touching the same thing, disgusting to think staff touch that then go make your food and visitors touch that when leaving bathroom and go eat there food. Serious  health concern! Or if all that is too expensive leave the door open during shifts with a piece of wood or something under it.  Also Only one toilet  in such a huge restaurant bathroom?? Needs a major renovation. Been like this for atlest 10 years. On a positive note staff are friendly and do work fast. Hope they put some papertowel in bathroom to grab when leaving the bathroom soon, or leave mens door open so you dont have to touch that handle and open that heavy door! Or make it automatic like the main entrance door which is very nice. ALSO been told at drivethrough the park on side and no one was even waiting behind me?? Had 2 items. Why have drive through if u make us wait? Seen others make this point to. Hope this review makes a difference. Leave a like if you agree with my points.\n\nSUMMARY\nPls improve! Manager owner. We understand that new people are hired everyday but other Mcdonalds do not have this problem, have them trained properly.\n\nCOOK FRIES PROPERLY WITH PROPER AMOUNT OF FRIES GIVEN CONSISTENLY WITH SALT! cook burgers so they are well done lil burn on em not under cooked with proper seasoning. Dont burn buns on breakfast sausage and egg.\n\nFIX BATHROOM PLS, offer paper towels to use to exit after washing hands and put garbage near to throw away, not just hand drier as everyone touches same handle and alot of people do not wash there hands!  or leave door open permanently with a wood stopper, or add automatic sensor to open door or replace door. Add another toilet, one toilet for a 60 seating restaurant is not enough. Renovate bathroom.\n\nDo not tell drivers to park on side when it is not busy. We go to drivethroughs cuz we are in a hurry. Add more staff to night shift food is always cold and not fresh especially fries and wait times are up to 40 min. HIRE MORE STAFF FOR NIGHT SHIFT.\n\nOreo mcfleury fill to top with ice cream and use more oreo or smarties etc not giving enough quantity .\n\nImprove coffee. Make sure to put what we order. 2 creams and 1 sugar, shouldnt taste like no sugar or no cream.\n\nThanks for listening and hope to see improvements in the coming week! Thank you staff and managers!",

                    "review_text": "SEE PICTURE. Seen this at landsdowne alderbridge way location, please no2 mcdonalds get this in your bathrooms so we can use are foot to open door! No one wants to touch the handle after washing your hands it is not sanitary and no napkings are still not provided at Mcdonalds no 2 . LEAVE A LIKE IF YOU AGREE. This NO 2 Mcdonalds makes the absolute worst fries of any mcdonalds ive been to, always undercooked or overcoooked, never fresh taste stale, clearly the staff cooks alot of fries at once and does not throw out after the designated time and also is not cooking the correct time consistently i constantly get like 10 of the fries extremely soft undercooked or a few black burnt. Also they short you on fries . Large fries always is never full to top aswell as medium!  The Oreo mcfleury never has enough icecream,  oreo or amount of extras, burgers are usually cooked well but sometimes after 6pm or night especially quarter pounder, cheeseburgers etc it is undercooked or has no taste.  Breakfast they do well, hashbrowns always fresh however ive notice sausage and egg bread is sometimes burned black or hard maybe adjust the toaster?? The coffee never taste really good i usually get 2 cream one sugar and it taste like nothing.

End up the fries is in small to medium amount which only filled half of the fries box! Further The two smoothies that we received were in the same size, the large smoothie was still have more than one centimetre before hitting the cup line near the top. When my son talked to the staff asking him to top up the large cup, he grabbed the two smoothies (one large and one medium size), and pour the smoothie out from the medium cup to the large cup to top up the large smoothie! What kind of attitude is that? We are not beggar who ask for free food but have paid full price for what we are entitled to receive from the merchant! When the staff passed the \"adjusted\" smoothies back to us, the female staff who was standing next to the Asian young staff who was dealing with our request looked surprised by what the Asian staff had done to the cups. This is a terrible customer service experience that we ever experienced at McDonald's. We will never come here again unless the team manager look into this and take appropriate action to a better training to their team! They need to know what is the proper amount of each food items and know what is a proper and respectful way to deal with their customers!",

A person was actually playing on her phone standing in front of the coffee station. So I guess there was one guy assigned to make the coffee and he was off doing something and needing to get scissors and going back but NO ONE even thought of trying to speed things along by making the coffee. They didn't look like trainees because no one was learning anything. There was a manager on site too! Plus other people in the back and a person sweeping up out front, and yet, no sign of a thought that they could help while there were only a couple of people waiting. Normally it's quite slow to get an order there later in the day but I always figured it was because they were overwhelmed with people and you can see many customers standing around (and at least they are trying and working hard), but in this case, they were not busy. So since no one had started to get the coffee yet, I asked politely if I could get the coffee in my own travel mug please. She answered yes, but with a derisive expression and tone but then didn't take the cup. So found out she was going to pour it in from their disposable cup after and that they don't charge for the cup there (which doesn't matter to me). The other McDonald's I go to has already put up a corporate sign encouraging using your own cup, so I know that while there is a Covid concern, as a company they have already made this change and McDonald's has produced this sign at least a month ago. Anyhow, I said that pouring it in defeats the purpose of trying to reduce waste, so she did bring it over to the area but did not explain it to the ONE GUY that apparently can pour coffee in the place and they still wasted a cup and to really rub it in, he opened up a straw in front of me to stir with completely unnecessarily when they knew I was concerned with waste because I had that conversation with that other woman and she completely couldn't be bothered to pass it on or look after the fact that I had made the request to use my cup directly (no one else was waiting in line). Also, when I told him not to (when I saw him open up the straw package), he continued moving to put it in the coffee even though I was CLEARLY saying no and then I had to really emphasize it, because he just wouldn't stop! SUCH AN UNPLEASANT experience. I am flabbergasted by the lack of any motivation to be competent by this crew. I understand division of labour but this was a huge failure. The other McDonald's that is encouraging travel mugs also gets the entire order done before I even get over to the counter and is friendly and normal, not rude and full of attitude on arrival. At the very least, try to be friendly when you greet someone, especially when they are friendly and happy in the first place, and especially when it was not busy at all! Submitted in the spirit of trying to help because if no one ever said anything, this place would keep having problems.",

They tell you to wait a few mins for your order but that's because they are cooking it fresher for you.\n\nEven though it seems they are still understaffed at times, the STAFF is putting in the effort to make each and every order the way it should be.

Because, the only reason I ordered that chicken burger was to try out the new sauce which is even advertised as a \"featured item\" on the app. I'd love to have a full refund and drive to Twassen to get my proper McDonald's order, which I do not have a high expection to, but what you guys are doing at the Ladner location is, absolutely ridiculous. I really hope this review gets some kind of attention from the employees to make some improvements.

They have no paper dispenser. Therefore the staff are probably picking up a collection of germs and bringing it to the kitchen.  I politely brought this to attention of the manager named Cameron B.  He was abrupt, dismissive and rash to the point of being discourteous. I'm at least double his age.  He kept repeating over my concerns: \"This has nothing to do with us\".

About a year ago the staff was fantastic but now they are all sad and mean, they don't care about the customers, but I guess that is what happens when u get paid minimum and you live in Lynn valley... just treat people the way u would want to be treated... Does it honestly cost u anything u put a couple mayo packages in the bag? ",

About a year ago the staff was fantastic but now they are all sad and mean, they don't care about the customers, but I guess that is what happens when u get paid minimum and you live in Lynn valley... just treat people the way u would want to be treated... Does it honestly cost u anything u put a couple mayo packages in the bag? ",

Due to the heavy weight, the tray broke in half and the 4 coffees spilled on the ground. The young lady asked the manager if she could get a replacement and have someone to clean up the floor. However....the manager said back to her \"can you get the mop from the washroom and clean it up yourself?\" The young lady was stunned and overwhelmed that the manager actually told her to go clean up the mess. The manager continues to say that \"in here, whoever makes the mess gotta clean up themselves.\" The young lady was also shocked and said \" excuse me, but what?\" Seeing the customer unsatisfied, the manager said \"okay, you can clean it up and I will tell someone (a worker) to help you.\"  This left me speech, I have never seen customer service like this anywhere else. This is West Van, I just think this location has ruined the reputation/face of park royal.",

I made no adjustments to my order for my double cheeseburger, but there were none on mine either. I went up to the counter to ask for a side of onions because there were none on the burger I ordered and the STORE MANAGER Samira? said they can't do that because THEY COME WITH THE PATTY? (I know this isn't true). I said okay so you have onions? She said yes. I said okay so why can't I get a side of them and she continued to say because they come with the patty's.. makes no sense, especially if you can get them without. She even asked \"how are you going to pay for them?\" Like what?! I paid for my burger that was supposed to have them on there already and now I have to pay for them? But I thought I couldn't get a side of onions? So I went and finished my meal, came back and showed her the ingredients on the McDonald's site that say my burger should have come with them. I showed her my receipt that said no onions on the happy meal and mine had no modifications. I said if you can't give me onions on the side then you should have offered to remake my burger. She proceeded to say that they could remake my burger but this was after I ate. I don't know why she couldn't just give me some onions on the side. Small issue, but the terrible customer service and lies are the reason for this review. Not only that but as busy as it was, our patty's were not fresh and the fries were just above luke warm and not fresh either. Nuggets were good. I should have taken photos, but I wasn't thinking of leaving a review until after we ate. If you live in the area, 2725 Barnet Hwy, Coquitlam, BC V3E 1K9 is a much better location to visit. The store manager there is amazing.",

After a couple of minutes my order is still not received,   I decided to tell them my number is not on the screen anymore and my order have not yet received,  the employee didn't even check my order #, just told me \"its coming\".  So I waited for another 5 minutes and I'm done with my patience and asked a lady wearing a black uniform (I guess it was atleast a supervisor) about my situation,  again she didn't check my order # and asked me rudely \"what was in your order\",  at that time another employee came over and  looked at my order # and handed me my coffee 10 seconds later,  and it's not hot anymore which means it's prepared for a while already,  but no one cares about it.  Last time I visited this place I waited 15 minutes for the same thing.  This will be my last visit to this Mcdonalds. Terrible customer service,  always seeing them chatting and not focus on orders,  no wonder this place receive a lot of complaints about messing up orders. Luckily there are other Mcdonalds I can order from not far away from this one.",

After a couple of minutes my order is still not received,   I decided to tell them my number is not on the screen anymore and my order have not yet received,  the employee didn't even check my order #, just told me \"its coming\".  So I waited for another 5 minutes and I'm done with my patience and asked a lady wearing a black uniform (I guess it was atleast a supervisor) about my situation,  again she didn't check my order # and asked me rudely \"what was in your order\",  at that time another employee came over and  looked at my order # and handed me my coffee 10 seconds later,  and it's not hot anymore which means it's prepared for a while already,  but no one cares about it.  Last time I visited this place I waited 15 minutes for the same thing.  This will be my last visit to this Mcdonalds. Terrible customer service,  always seeing them chatting and not focus on orders,  no wonder this place receive a lot of complaints about messing up orders. Luckily there are other Mcdonalds I can order from not far away from this one.",

Yesterday, Aug 15 2023, I went to the drive thru to order a large iced water for my grandmother who was experiencing heat exhaustion and they refused to give out water on a day that it got up to 37! They said they would not give us a cup of iced water unless we made a purchase of an item. Water is a basic human right, especially in the middle of a heat wave. They finally gave her a SMALL cup of water and refused to give any more than that. We have always been customers at this location to purchase food. The customer service has always been terrible but after yesterday we will no longer visit this location. Staff there clearly need to be trained better. Jeez having some compassion at least towards an elderly person.",
