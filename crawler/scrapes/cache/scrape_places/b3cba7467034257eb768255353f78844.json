However, after observing others' orders, I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did. I chose the chicken bowl, and the Middle Eastern flavors were fantastic, while the portion size was adequate. The only downside was that the restaurant was a bit chilly, but since it's located near the entrance and it's freezing outside, this is likely the case for most places along Main Street. I had a great experience here and enjoyed the shawarma. The meat was very flavorful and everything appeared to be fresh. The portion size was decent, although the bowl had more veggies than meat. Additionally, the cost was a bit high, but overall it was a positive experience. It's worth noting that all the meat served is Halal.",

I had a great experience here and enjoyed the shawarma. The meat was very flavorful and everything appeared to be fresh. The portion size was decent, although the bowl had more veggies than meat. Additionally, the cost was a bit high, but overall it was a positive experience. It's worth noting that all the meat served is Halal.",
