I phoned the building manager and she told me to try Latham's as they have done work in our building. I phoned on Wednesday, and they scheduled me for Friday between 9am to 11am... At 10:50 I phoned and asked when will the plumber be arriving? They said someone will call me soon. At 11:15am am someone phoned me and they arrived at 11:45am. He took a quick look and discovered that the water can not be stopped as the main valve will not shut off the water in the unit. After the plumber did a minor adjustment to the toilet and he was on his way at 12:40pm. I went to his van and he gave me an invoice for 2.5 hours of $323.41\nWhen I asked why was the bill for 2.5 hours, the plumber told me that he had to park his car which took him 15 min extra, and also had to go to his office and invoice me, which would take another 1 hour and 45 minutes.\nThe actual work that the plumber did was 15 min. For the rest of the time he was chatting with the building manager about some other issue in the building. This is a total scam. They know there is free parking for trades in the building, no need to drive around downtown for free parking. It's not right to charge your customers 1.5 hours extra time for invoicing them.\nSTAY AWAY!!!! I would not recommend Gordon Latham plumbing!!!!",
