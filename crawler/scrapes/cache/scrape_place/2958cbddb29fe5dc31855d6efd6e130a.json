The floors were just moped aswell and the condiment stand and garbage clear. My meal was also great. Really hot fries and warm burger. I got the crispy chicken deluxe meal. The till person at the front was nice, had a smile and a good attitude. I appreciate all these things amounting to a great visit!",

The floors were just moped aswell and the condiment stand and garbage clear. My meal was also great. Really hot fries and warm burger. I got the crispy chicken deluxe meal. The till person at the front was nice, had a smile and a good attitude. I appreciate all these things amounting to a great visit!",

The car beside us was a little loud and it was late. They ran out of nuts for the Sunday so it wasn't as good as other times. My daughter was sad they the kids meal was served in a regular bag not the box but she loved the toy. It was our first time trying the Poutine which was hot and tasty the McDouble was a little cold but mot messy like other times.  The staff were friendly. We will go back again next time.",
