End up the fries is in small to medium amount which only filled half of the fries box! Further The two smoothies that we received were in the same size, the large smoothie was still have more than one centimetre before hitting the cup line near the top. When my son talked to the staff asking him to top up the large cup, he grabbed the two smoothies (one large and one medium size), and pour the smoothie out from the medium cup to the large cup to top up the large smoothie! What kind of attitude is that? We are not beggar who ask for free food but have paid full price for what we are entitled to receive from the merchant! When the staff passed the \"adjusted\" smoothies back to us, the female staff who was standing next to the Asian young staff who was dealing with our request looked surprised by what the Asian staff had done to the cups. This is a terrible customer service experience that we ever experienced at McDonald's. We will never come here again unless the team manager look into this and take appropriate action to a better training to their team! They need to know what is the proper amount of each food items and know what is a proper and respectful way to deal with their customers!",
