A safe bet overall for everyone in a group. We were a group of four and one of us had a more strict diet restriction. I ordered the Classic Benedict, which would be better if it came with more sauce.\n\nThey had Mighty Leaf for tea, which was one of the best tea bag brand you could find at grocery store. It was a pleasant surprise.\n\nOur server seemed to have a bad day and struggled a bit.

I asked for easy dressing for the farro salad with grilled chicken and they delivered that. The grilled chicken breast was cold and over cooked and they offered to redo the grilled chicken, which's much better. The Turkey dinner was quite good - Turkey breast is soft and tender. Wish the gravy to serve by the side as it's on the salty side. Service was good. We wanted to make a reservation and they did not accept reservation for party of two. It's a busy night. Overall a pleasant dinner experience.",
