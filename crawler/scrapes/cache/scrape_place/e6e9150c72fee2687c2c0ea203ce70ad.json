Also, a great deal of the beef cubes had massive amounts of fat....maybe trim those? I doubt many people enjoy chunks of cow fat in their mouths.\n\nThe spices were nice and steamed rice tasted....well like rice that's been steamed. The Prawn Skewer was a bit disappointing. It wasn't grilled it was pan fried....big difference, and for the price the prawns were tiny and what it seemed was they tried to make up for it with veggies (see pic.)\n\nYeah...not really feeling any particular way about this experience, which I guess kinda says it all.",
