Introduction of my pup to the vet was loaded with treats to ensure a good experience for the pup. The vet I spoke with was very informative and listened to my every concern, also gave me a earful of recommendations for a healthy pup. Very satisfied.",

            "review_id": "We recently moved homes so we had to find a new vet in our area. I saw the reviews for Vancouver East Veterinary Walk-In Clinic so we booked our cat in here. Sadly, this was a huge mistake on our part. We took our cat in for her annual checkup. All of the documents were transferred from our previous vet to this one, so it should have her up to date vaccine information and other health background. Unfortunately, Dr. Shura didn't even pay attention to her vaccination history anyways, and despite our cat having gotten her 3-year vaccines in 2018, he said it was done in 2017 and then vaccinated her anyways. I didn't notice this until I got home and saw my previous invoices from the previous vet that said she last got the vaccination in 2018. A few days after we got home from the vet, my cat's hair started falling out in the area where the vaccination was injected. We tried calling Vancouver East Veterinary Walk-In Clinic on Wednesday at around 10AM and there was no pick-up (they are closed most of the week, open only for limited hours in the afternoon), no voice mail, and no emergency line you can call. We ended up having to drive back to our old vet to get her looked at because that was our only option. I understand that adverse side effect may happen after a vaccination, but I am very disappointed that the vet misread her vaccination history and gave her something she didn't need, and also we weren't able to reach them or an alternate number. When we were getting our cat looked at, Mr. Shura said to us that he doesn't like to overvaccinate animals because he'll get our money through teeth cleanings anyways (he had recommended a teeth cleaning for our cat). I couldn't tell if he was a vet or a used car salesman.",
