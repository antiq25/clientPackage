I ordered only their recommended dishes - pork toast, stir-fry basil, and boat noodles. The pork toast was very disappointing. There was barely any pork on the toast, like 95% bread and 5% pork. It just tasted like oily bread. Boat noodles were awful. Noodles were congealed. I couldn't even separate it in the hot soup. I am questioning the freshness of their noodles. Was it cooked a head of time hours ago? Soup was bland. Salt and lots of oil. Meat pieces were tough and chewy. The stir fry basil dish was solid and was the best out of the 3 dishes I ordered. Overall, there are better Thai restaurants that are way more affordable.",

We picked the medium Thai spice level which wasn't excessively spicy but the heat does grow as you continue to eat.\n\nOverall, tasty food. Also liked the Thai lemon tea and cha yen (Thai yes with condensed milk). Would really like to come back to try their curry dish.\n\nUpdate: Returned in mid-November and tried their appetizer platter, tom yum, green curry chicken, and drunken noodles. They were much busier on this visit (guess the word had gotten out). Loved the translucent noodles in the drunken noodle dish and the green curry rice was amazing. The tom yum soup was spicy and chock full of ingredients. And we enjoyed the items in the platter (crispy pork toast, veggie spring rolls, shrimp wrap, and pork jerky).",

The mango sticky rice dessert was also very tasty.   Definitely would recommend.   Dishes were customized to accommodate our food allergies too.",

Service is equally as warm and welcoming and was very helpful with suggestions and accommodations on their menu. I highly recommended the crying tiger, pad se ew and boat noodle; thick noodles are a must. Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for authentic Thai food!",

From the moment we stepped in, the ambiance set the stage for what was an unforgettable evening. The decor, an elegant blend of traditional Thai elements and modern touches, created a welcoming and lively atmosphere.\n\nThe service was exceptional. Our server was knowledgeable, attentive, and had great suggestions for our diverse group. We started with Assorted Appetizers, Veggie spring rolls, crispy pork toast, shrimp wrap, and pork jerky. Each dish was a hit, perfectly balanced in flavors and textures.\n\nThe main courses were a delightful journey through Thai cuisine. The green curry with chicken was rich and aromatic, with just the right level of spice. The Pad Thai was simply the best I've ever had, with a perfect blend of sweet, sour, and great flavors. We also tried a lesser-known dish, Khao Soi, which was a revelation with its creamy coconut curry and tender noodles.\n\nWhat truly made the night special was the shared joy of exploring these flavors with friends. The portions were generous, ideal for sharing, and it sparked lively conversations and shared laughter. To end the meal, we indulged in mango sticky rice and Thai iced tea, which were the perfect sweet notes to conclude a fantastic meal.\n\nIn summary, Zab Bite restaurant is not just about extraordinary Thai food; it's about the experience of sharing delicious, well-crafted dishes with good company in a beautiful setting. It's a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy Thai cuisine at its best. A solid 5 stars for the amazing food, ambiance, and service. Can't wait to return!",
