The counter was still closed at 9am. The pharmacist was chatting with another pharmacist about other things while serving me. At the time picked up the prescription, the pharmacist was rushed and did not explain about the details about the prescription or any side effect. She just read the brief instructions on the medicine and did not even ask if I have any questions with the medication. They did not care about customer service. I would say avoid this pharmacy if you could.",
