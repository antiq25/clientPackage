I got the Miku Signature Selection and Surf & Turf Roll for dinner. I cannot recommend the Miku Signature Selection enough. It was an incredible selection of the menu, essentially a chance to try everything except the Surf & Turf roll. Everything in the Selection was delicious and novel. The Surf & Turf roll really blew me away with the addition of truffle flavor. My mouth is watering just writing this review.",

I didn't order a lot as I had a heavy lunch, but enough to try a variety of their fish. Green tea opera cake was also delicious - layers were the perfect consistency, level of crunch and flavours.\n\nGood atmosphere - it's light and airy inside, it has a stunning view of the mountains and ocean, and the place is buzzing.\n\nService was professional, attentive and he gave his recommendation when I couldn't decide on two desserts. The staff at the front were polite when I arrived and left.\n\nWashrooms are pretty nice, there's dim lighting and it's relatively modern.\n\nI prefer this Miku to the one in Toronto. This one has a better location and view - it was nice to walk around Canada Place afterwards too.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend this place!",
