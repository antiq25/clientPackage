He then proceeded to give me vague answers and sigh repeatedly as I asked the difference between medications so I could choose one to purchase. The judgemental arrogant attitude I received, coupled with the fact he told me I couldn't get my inhaler filled until the next day (it was only 4pm) even tho I told him I was short of breath and it's just ventolin that I ALREADY HAVE A REFILL ON FILE FOR, leads me to give them a 1/10. I have several other negative experiences too this is not a one off. This is a terrible pharmacy who doesn't care about their patients health, just about their profits.",

It is not enough that you have to wait for 45 min to pick your medication ( I came 48 hours after my confirmed pickup date) I also have to wait for 30 min on the phone to fill in my prescription cause someone very smart at loblaw decided that the online refill system is too good and customers were using it to save their and the staff time so they decommissioned the system a year ago without putting another one in place.
