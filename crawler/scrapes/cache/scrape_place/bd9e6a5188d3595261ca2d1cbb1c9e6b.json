And Saigon Secrets come on....\n\nAtmosphere not the greatest.   Service was somewhat good, I mean the servers hounding you every 3 minutes to see if you want to order  more.   Food quality not good.  Expect better then this in Vancouver.  Can get 100 times better Banh mi for 1/3 the price all across Vancouver.  Sushi meh.....  Pho, price vs quality...
