We had the souvlaki platter, dip taster and moussaka.\n\nI took half a star away for the music being slightly too loud for good conversation (especially beneath the speakers), and another half star for our server (tall, brunette lady with tattoos) not being the best. Don't get me wrong, she did not do anything wrong per se but also did not make us feel particularly welcomed or treated warmly. Not sure if it was because we weren't drinking. She was... just doing her job and it was clear from the way she came across.\n\nI would come again for the food!",

We ordered a Greek feta salad, pork souvlaki, lamb souvlaki skewers and the platter for 2 in which we got chicken skewers, pork skewers and tiger shrimp.

Though I was a bit disappointed with the salmon (a bit bland tasting) and wished I went with my original choice of two prawns. Those were very flavourful and cooked perfectly! The rice was a bit watery. I loved the veggies on the side. The souvlaki meal didn't come with pita, which was a first at a Greek place!\n\nThe ambiance was good. Decor was nice.

I'm not sure what vibe this restaurant is going for but it's not fine dining. The music is loud and so you can't hear yourself think. It's a cross between a bar and a club only there's no dance floor and they serve food.\n\nThe food itself is disappointing, either charge less or increase your portions. I ordered the spanakopita and my boyfriend ordered the moussaka. These would pass for an appetiser at best.\n\nI don't recommend this place and won't be coming back.",
