Thank you, Minah, who is kind, yet has all of her sincerity, trust, and skills. I really appreciate it.\nNow I have to buy a house ~ I'm really looking forward to it.",

I think they both took care of the house beautifully and put a lot of effort into the sale together with me. From now on, I will work even harder to prepare for the house I am moving into. thank you",
