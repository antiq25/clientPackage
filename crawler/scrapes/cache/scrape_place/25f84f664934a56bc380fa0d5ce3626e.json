It was drenched, I would ask for it on the side.\nI was told the canned items tasted delicious. In my opinion, I disagree. Had the razor clam and octopus......everything had the over cooked texture.\nThe menu was not lacking.

You ask them about the dishes, and they read me what was exactly written on the menu. I can read, thank you. Had to push for what it tasted like, and the texture.",

The portion is like a kids' meal. What a scam!! All that waiting, we get a size of a cereal bowl portion? Restaurant should be called Como get scammed\n\nResponse: so you don't take taxes and tips into consideration? That's why I said 40. Yea we did see the process but yes it still took more than an hour for the plate to arrive on my table. Check your camera (I'll even bet you money for it). Funny how you don't respond about the portion size, just like everyone else who left the reviews. Maybe I'll come to the competition and help you remove some dirt out of your eyes, scammer.",

The other 180 people that came had a great time, and the small business we collab with does an amazing job. To be clear, it's $28, and the actual people who cook the Paella do it traditionally, so it takes an hour. If you are still hungry after this...don't know what to tell you... They also take pictures with everyone and show how it's done. We offer food and drinks while guests are waiting, how dare we. Good things come to those who wait, not for those who prob just want to take a picture and leave. PS, the crew from Paella Guys are competing in the world championships this year ",
