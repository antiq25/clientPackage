Unlike some other places that  provide mediocre quantity or just fill it to the container.  Tantos Kitchen staff filled my order above the container.  I like it .   Service was excellent as well.  Food quality is excellent too!  Tantos Kitchen also serve ice cream.  All foods are take out only so bring your own bag.",

            "review_text": "This location used to be Kent's Kitchen in Vancouver Chinatown.  The new owner wanted to serve the community with quality Chinese food at reasonable prices.  I believe they achieved it.  Today is my first time here and bought some Chinese dishes for tonight's dinner.  I was surprised to see how much they served for my order.  Unlike some other places that  provide mediocre quantity or just fill it to the container.  Tantos Kitchen staff filled my order above the container.  I like it .   Service was excellent as well.  Food quality is excellent too!  Tantos Kitchen also serve ice cream.  All foods are take out only so bring your own bag.",

They have tablets, cell phones, wallets, shoes, and some interesting collector items...funko pops and canucks figures, boxes of pokemon packs and toys\nBetter than any other claw machine I played and this one is easier. The good can't beat for around $12... would be $18 to $22 anywhere else..and better than the food court at the malls",
