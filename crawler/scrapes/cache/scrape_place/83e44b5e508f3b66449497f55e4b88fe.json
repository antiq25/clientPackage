The decor is modern, and the view is spectacular, especially because we went right as the sun set. Each dish is comfortably shared amongst 3 people, unless stated differently. The flavors are so fresh and bold. Make sure to order as much bread as you need to complete the dips and sauces. I went with a group of 10 people and spent roughly $60 per person, with 2 bottles of wine and there were left overs that we split amongst ourselves. Large groups are too big for the venue but they were so lovely by accommodating us.  The service really helped make this place stand out. This place is a great date or venue to bring your best friends, best suited for groups of 4 to 6. So don't dress too casual here, it's definitely a place to look a bit more polished when you arrive.",

            "review_id": "Amazing Mediterranean gem in the bay front area with fantastic atmosphere and great food and service! Very authentic and delicious food all the way from Syria and Lebanon, freshly made and tasting like nothing you ever tried before. Nice choice of salads, small mezze plates to share and something for everyone's taste. Several nice vegetarian and vegan options as well. Strongly recommend Fattoush Salad, which is just delicious, hummus is next level, fresh and yummy, and don't get me started on freshly baked pita bread. Place gets very busy on weekends, so make sure to make a booking, although if you are alone or couple, if you are lucky - you may get seated at the bar to admire amazing skills of bartender Anka, who is just doing magic there and  is very helpful and offers great advice. If you love Mediterranean food you'll be in heaven.",
