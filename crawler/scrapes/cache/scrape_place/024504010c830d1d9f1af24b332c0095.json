Unfortunately, the experience was largely disappointing.\n\n+ Good service. We were promptly greeted by the two ladies working there. They were friendly and both checked in during our meal to ask how things were.\n+ Portion sizes were reasonable.\n\n- Pricey: We ordered the G-Money burger, Cajun burger, a side of fries and a Coke, which came to $42. The G-Money burger was also $17 in-store despite being listed online for $13.\n- Lack of seasoning: The burgers and fries were both very bland because they had absolutely no seasoning. The flavour of the beef and fries could greatly benefit from a little salt and pepper.\n- The cut and texture of the fries were not the most appealing. Also, the fries in our basket were a mix of piping hot and cold.\n- We noticed a lot of gnats flying around while we were eating, which often makes you question cleanliness behind the scenes.\n\nI am not a local, but if I was, I would not be back a second time.",
