Every piece was crispy and even after it cooled, they didn't become soggy. The Maxine's Bacon were thick cut bacon with a slightly sweet taste. They also have regular bacon as an add on if you prefer savoury bacon.\n\nThey don't take reservations for brunch and their peak hours are around 11am to 1:30pm. If you're a party of 2, you'll be seated relatively quickly. Larger groups will be a longer wait as most of their tables seat 2-4 people.

They also have regular bacon as an add on if you prefer savoury bacon.\n\nThey don't take reservations for brunch and their peak hours are around 11am to 1:30pm. If you're a party of 2, you'll be seated relatively quickly. Larger groups will be a longer wait as most of their tables seat 2-4 people. They also don't have an indoor waiting area so I wouldn't recommend coming on a rainy day if you don't want to wait in the rain.",

Patty was good but wasn't as crispy as I'd like to see from a smash patty - Monzo does this better.\n\nFries were the highlight. Fresh cut shoe string fries cooked to the right crisp level.\n\nI would go back in order to try other menu items. Restaurant has a French bistro vibe and the prices are very reasonable.",
