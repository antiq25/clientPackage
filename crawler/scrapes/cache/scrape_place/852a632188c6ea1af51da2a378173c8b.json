I freaking loved it!\n\nIn terms of the actual restaurant, it's not anything extraordinary but more of like a grab and go place, with a few stands if you wanna dine in. Nothing wrong with it tho, will definitely visit again soon!",

Yes it's hard to find parking, minimal seating, sometimes lengthy waits, expensive (compared to what though? It's Vancouver) but it's so worth it. The fried chicken is always juicy and perfecy seasoned, the skin is so crispy. The pickles are seasoned too and it's so good. If you just get chicken to go, they'll put it on bread to absorb the oil which is genius. The crinkle cut fries are delicious and I like to alternate between ketchup and DL sauce. Because of the price, this is more of a big scheduled treat than a convenient stop for me but I look forward to it!",
