The hostesses were very courteous and our server, Chris, was amazing. He thoroughly explained different menu options to make sure the experience was catered to our tastes and checked on us often from the appetizers through the main course to dessert.\n\nThe atmosphere was wonderful. We sat in the semi-outdoor seating area near the bar with beautiful foliage and piano playing in the background.\n\nOne thing to note: be wary of the bread--delicious and so tempting to keep eating it but save your appetite for the main course and you won't be sorry. Tagliatelle, poached halibut, and king salmon were perfect along with the raspberry pavlova. Also enjoyed our drinks: \"What the Flower\" and \"Needed Escape\".\n\nWould definitely recommend!",

The hostesses were very courteous and our server, Chris, was amazing. He thoroughly explained different menu options to make sure the experience was catered to our tastes and checked on us often from the appetizers through the main course to dessert.\n\nThe atmosphere was wonderful. We sat in the semi-outdoor seating area near the bar with beautiful foliage and piano playing in the background.\n\nOne thing to note: be wary of the bread--delicious and so tempting to keep eating it but save your appetite for the main course and you won't be sorry. Tagliatelle, poached halibut, and king salmon were perfect along with the raspberry pavlova. Also enjoyed our drinks: \"What the Flower\" and \"Needed Escape\".\n\nWould definitely recommend!",

I'm sure the food is great, and ideally, I would have enjoyed the chance to taste it, but I only had an hour and I'd heard amazing things about their cocktail program so that was my only intention.\n\nAnd it was worth it.\n\nThere are a lot of bars on the \"official\" Best Bars of 202_ and of the ones I've tried, often they're pretty underwhelming. I don't know who chooses them or how much money a bar has to pay to be on them, but most of the time, it doesn't seem to match with my experiences.\n\nBotanist, however, does belong on that list. Is it the best cocktail bar ever? No. But it is an exceptionally good hotel bar? Yes.\n\nArguably, hotel bars have a much more difficult task than a regular cocktail bar because they have to appeal to a much wider range of tastes, people, and experiences. Generally, they're fairly generic, and play it safe with flavours, never straying too far from trends or accessibility of the most inexperienced tourist.\n\nThat's why Botanist is special. Sure, sitting at the bar, I saw people be boring and order Aperol Spritzes and wines and espresso martinis.  But the cocktail menu is so much more. It's big, for one thing. Has a great deal of diversity. You can find any sort of drink from a fizzy, sweet concoction to a serious spirit-forward sipper.\n\nWhat I enjoyed most was the marriage of very BC/Canadian ingredients with spirits, some of which are fairly rare to find on a hotel bar cocktail list. Both that I tried were delicious, and mostly important for me, you can actually taste and feel the booze. Sure, one of them (Council of Trees -- amazing name!) seemed pretty juicy and easy, but you could *feel* it by the last sip. What a sneaky drink. I loved it. That's what I'm looking for: cool flavours, mixed and balanced so well that I barely can tell it's a cocktail but hits hard enough that I don't say, \"Well, I could have just ordered a lemonade.\" Don't get me wrong, you can taste the interesting scotch, but it wasn't too much or too little. I'm going to be honest: I saw the Council of Trees on their menu online weeks ahead of time when planning my trip and knew I had to try it. I adored the botanical ingredients, and even its little cryptic blurb on the menu. If nothing else, I was going to try it. And it did not disappoint.\n\nThe second cocktail (Stone Fox) was a lot heavier, and very spirit-forward, which I appreciate on a cocktail menu. Especially hotels. As a cognac lover, I had to try it. It was a little heavy on the sweet apricot for me personally, but a lot of people would like it this way.\n\nShout out to the great bar snacks, too. They do not skimp. It was almost like a tapa, that's how much you get and it's good quality too.\n\nBartenders were sociable but not overbearing and seemed to nail the choices for other patrons. The bar area itself is small, and not exactly the coziest as it's right in the corridor leading from the entrance to the restaurant, but if you're only having a drink or two, it's totally fine. Hostess was super-nice and accommodating.\n\nWould definitely come back.",
