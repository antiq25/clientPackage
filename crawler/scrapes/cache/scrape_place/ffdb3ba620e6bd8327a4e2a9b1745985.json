It's a small operation so you have to wait a little for your food but it's worth it and freshly cooked. The couple running it are so kind and lovely.",

Most of the menu items feature their homemade blue corn tortillas and there's a great selection of traditional cacao drinks (hot and iced) - stuff that I don't think you can find anywhere else in the city. So I was very curious to try, and decided to take my parents here while they were visiting because my dad requested \"Mexican food\". Because this is not your typical Mexican food I wasn't sure if it would be what they had in mind, but it was a hit with all of us and my dad even said it might be the best Mexican food he's ever had.\nI got the chihatl to drink and the itacates de flor de calabaza for my meal. My first time trying chihatl, first time trying itacates, and first time trying pumpkin blossom in any form, and everything was amazing. Even though the chihatl was served icy it was still a \"warming\" drink with the cinnamon spice. The frothed texture was really cool. Very unique taste. The itacates are probably best described as Mexican samosas, but the tortillas are not deep-fried which keeps them soft. The tortilla and bean filling had an earthy flavour which paired perfectly with the flor de calabaza (I had no expectation to what pumpkin blossom would taste like but it surprisingly was very similar to pumpkin flesh). The waiter brought 3 sauces to the table for us: pico de gallo, a dark and sweet salsa roja, and a spicy salsa verde. The sauces were all delicious (I could've eaten the roja with a spoon) but almost unnecessary as the food was so tasty even without that it felt a shame to do anything to cover it up.\nMy parents had the Huarache Nopal and Machete Pollito and were, needless to say, very happy with those, but I didn't try them. I did try my dad's hot chocolate, which is great if you're not so adventurous since it basically just tasted like a really high quality but \"mainstream\" hot choc. Also note the drinks are served in bowls made from large dried gourd husks(?) which provides a unique drinking experience.\nThe prices are really fair for what you're getting. The total for our party (3 entrees and 2 drinks) came to about $75 before tip.\nThe place is small and really cozy, and while the staff wasn't the most outgoing, they were polite and seemed to really care to make sure we were enjoying everything. I would really recommend this place for a truly different Mexican dining experience.",
