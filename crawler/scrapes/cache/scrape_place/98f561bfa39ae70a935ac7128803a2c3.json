Just before Xmas last year my daughter and I got a little ginger girl and we love her so much we wanted to give her a friend.  Of course we went back to Nikki and she didn't let us down. Nikki briefly spoke of how some of these cats as well as dogs,  had been treated prior to her stepping in and rescuing them and about how the pandemic and natural disasters have increased the poor faith of these vulnerable animals.  She really cares for animals.  She is defiantly a cat lady through and through. The work she does for these animals is incredible. I don't know what will happen to all the animals in the b.c in distress when she retires. Although I can't see her retiring bc she cares too much about animals being treated badly. Weather it be an issue of hoarding, owners on substances and or natural disasters. As well as her program for seniors she is right on it. We often get caught up in our busy lives and  forget about animals and there well being.  If you can't adopt a cat from Nikki please consider sponsoring a cat or make a donation. I'm not sure if she excepts blankets and towels but that could be an idea as well.",
