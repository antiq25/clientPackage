It was well marinated and very fragrant !\n\nWe also got the Krsma Chicken Tikka (15.95) which was super juicy , tender and had a slight sourness from the yogurt.\n\nLastly we got an order of fish pakoras (9.95). These were lightly battered and very juicy. The batter was crispy and lightly salted. Amazing with the mint chutney!\n\nThe staff were generous and gave us complimentary papadum! It was very crispy and lightly salted. It came with tamarind and mint chutney. The mint chutney was stellar ! It was the perfect blend of sour, spicy any lemon!\n\nEdit (10/21/23): went back for lunch and tried their Onion Bajia 8.95 and fish korma 15.95 with a side of rice (4.95). The onion Bajia was very crispy and lightly battered, with the perfect amount of saltiness and crispiness. The fish korma was outstanding! The cashew curry was very rich and had a yummy sweetness to it. The fish was also very tender.\n\nThe owner was kind and provided a Gulab Jamun on the house, it was nice and warm...mmmm.",
