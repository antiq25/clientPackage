It had a crispy and crunchy texture, similar to the sensation you'd get when chewing an apple. Fried Pork Dumpling was crispy and flavourful. The rest of the dishes were just OK. Nothing bad, but nothing to write home about either. It's a decent place to go to if you're just looking for a simple bowl of noodles to fill your tummy. They certainly have made the stretching of the noodles into an art, and it's fun to watch them at it!\n\nService: Could have been better\nParking: Paid parking on the street\nLocation:1739 Robson St., Vancouver, BC\n",

Brought a lot of nostalgia to the ones I had back in China.\n\nThe star of the show was 100% the noodles, hand pulled noodles are super unique in texture and these certainly delivered.\n\nThe soup were really nice and light, accompanied by good amount of green onions and cilantro. Would strongly recommend the spicy option as it as another level of depth to the soup.",
