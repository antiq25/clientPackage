If there are 2 screens, they should have 2 people inside working drive thru. Finally got my food ordered ($15 worth of food), paid, and when I got to the pickup window I was handed my 2 drinks and was told to wait in the reserved stall for my food. It took another 6 minutes to get my food brought to my car. To wait 10 minutes for such little food in a drive thru is absurd.",
