So I can't say for sure how well it holds up for delivery or long transport.\n\nThe beef: smash-seared perfectly. Not too thin that you get jerky. Smashed enough so you get a crisp meaty crust but the center is still juicy.\n\nThe bun: airy, light, not soggy or falling aparty.\n\nThe caramelized onions: slowly cooked to a perfect unrushed jammy perfection.\n\nWill definitely be back to try the other more hefty burgers!",
