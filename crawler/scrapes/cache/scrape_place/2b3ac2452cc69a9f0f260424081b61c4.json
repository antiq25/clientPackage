This rezzie is perfect as their portions are not generous and suits a weekday dinner. And the Hainanese chicken is as good as in the past, but what's outstanding are their chicken oil rice - Yummy - and the accompanying soup, which is such a good chicken broth that I guess they make from the bones of their boneless chicken. As good as home made chicken soup (oops, my better half is NOT gonna like this remark!). Opted for the half chicken with the 3 bowls of rice and 2 soups. My my my, they still serve  small portions - must be pigmy chickens!! LOL, but the smoothness and flavour makes up for the lack of quantity. And the price - boy it's higher than I remembered it - but what's as cheap now as in the past??!! Oh well!!",
