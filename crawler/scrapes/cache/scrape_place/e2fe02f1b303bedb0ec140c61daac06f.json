I decided to stop in for breakfast on our way out today and at 8:45 and the floor was disgusting and all the tables were dirty and sticky, there was nowhere to sit. I asked the girl when I got my food if I could get it to go because all the tables were sticky and she said ok. Didn't have anyone clean, didn't apologize.
