However, making a reservation through Google Maps was not possible, as the dates and times were never available. We eventually booked directly from the restaurant's homepage, where we had to pay a $25 deposit per person. Surprisingly, the restaurant wasn't as busy as we initially anticipated, and it seemed like walking in without a deposit would have been fine. As for the food, it was generally good. We ordered a variety of dishes, including cured meat, cheese, pasta, and beef skewers, which were served in sampler-sized plates. The pasta had a chewy texture, while the salad served alongside the beef skewers lacked thoughtful presentation. The dessert doughnuts could use some improvement in terms of presentation, but they were deliciously chewy. The service was polite, although it felt a bit awkward. Overall, the experience was okay.",
