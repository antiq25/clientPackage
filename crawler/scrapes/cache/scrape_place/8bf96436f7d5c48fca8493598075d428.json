During the COVID pandemic a wonderful young pharmacist (Lay Shah) worked really hard to work with his customers ensuring that they have accurate and appropriate information.  When I needed various vaccines over the past 3 years, he ensured that I was informed, understood all of the effects of the same.   What totally and forever impressed me and created a 'super fan' was a couple of weeks ago.  Lay was the only person (bearing in mind that he is a pharmacist) accepting drop-off and pickup orders.  I didn't have the time to wait so continued on my shopping journey.  As I was leaving the store, Lay asked if I needed to renew a 'scrip' I said yes, he asked how many meds I needed, I said all 4 and off he want to prepare my monthly order.  Didn't ask my name, no hassle, he just knew what needed to be done.  When I picked up my order today (post December 31st, he understood that I needed the scrip renewal in the last fiscal year, which was reflected.\n\nIn my opinion Lay goes the extra mile, knows his customers, their needs and is always respectful, always helpful , and always responsive.  Employee of the Year Award, if there is one, is 'owned' by Lay.  Many thanks for all of your hard work, dedication, for being there when lots of people haven't been.\n\nAll the very best to you Lay and your family.  I wish each of you a happy, safe and healthy New Year.\n\nWarm regards from my family to yours.",
