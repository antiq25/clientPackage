The service was great, with attentive staff who were knowledgeable and helpful with providing recommendations. The food was amazing!  The chicken were juicy and flavorful! However, they are still a bit spicy for me even though I ordered plain.  We loved the halloumi cheese and that yummy egg dessert too!!! Plus the cozy ambiance added an extra touch of comfort to the dining experience. Highly recommended!",

The staff was welcoming, attentive, and ready to assist with any requests.
