Very clean inside, ambiance is very comforting and the staff was friendly. The person at the till was super helpful with recommendations and I went with all his recommendations.\n\nWhat I ordered:\n* Veggie style Cheese Burger, Single patty (Recommend) $11.50\n* Combo: Fries and a Orange Milkshake (Recommend) $11\n\nThis veggie burger hit all the spots for flavour, their in house sauce laying under fresh tasty veggies and the veggie patty was satisfying, slightly crispy but not greasy in a brioche bun. Highly recommend, the burger was super filling so warning the fries were very tasty as well but it was quite a lot! They fresh cut their fries thin like McDonald's but tastes so much better, crispy, thin and not as greasy. To top off my order I wanted to try their milkshakes. Staff had reco the orange milkshake and what a pleasant surprised that turned out to be! Reminds me of a cream soda orange pop but in a creamy milkshake version! Overall everything was super tasty, I'd recommend taking your order to go if you're making it a combo but the burger itself was good enough. I'd come back to try their vegan burger with the vegan bun. A little pricey here but tastes like fresh ingredients and quality ingredients, so worth the $27 bill with tip.",
