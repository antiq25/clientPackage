No one wants to touch the handle after washing your hands it is not sanitary and no napkings are still not provided at Mcdonalds no 2 . LEAVE A LIKE IF YOU AGREE. This NO 2 Mcdonalds makes the absolute worst fries of any mcdonalds ive been to, always undercooked or overcoooked, never fresh taste stale, clearly the staff cooks alot of fries at once and does not throw out after the designated time and also is not cooking the correct time consistently i constantly get like 10 of the fries extremely soft undercooked or a few black burnt. Also they short you on fries . Large fries always is never full to top aswell as medium!  The Oreo mcfleury never has enough icecream,  oreo or amount of extras, burgers are usually cooked well but sometimes after 6pm or night especially quarter pounder, cheeseburgers etc it is undercooked or has no taste.  Breakfast they do well, hashbrowns always fresh however ive notice sausage and egg bread is sometimes burned black or hard maybe adjust the toaster?? The coffee never taste really good i usually get 2 cream one sugar and it taste like nothing. The bathroom is a horrible, extremely heavy door with no automatic button!  literally everyone is touching the same handle to get in and out, disgusting!!  a foot handle would make the difference and is much needed or replace the door you make enough money common guys, or automated door... or at the very least leave paper towel so staff and visitors can at least grab door with handle and throw in a nearby garbage like every other store!!!  so not every is touching the same thing, disgusting to think staff touch that then go make your food and visitors touch that when leaving bathroom and go eat there food. Serious  health concern! Or if all that is too expensive leave the door open during shifts with a piece of wood or something under it.  Also Only one toilet  in such a huge restaurant bathroom?? Needs a major renovation. Been like this for atlest 10 years. On a positive note staff are friendly and do work fast. Hope they put some papertowel in bathroom to grab when leaving the bathroom soon, or leave mens door open so you dont have to touch that handle and open that heavy door! Or make it automatic like the main entrance door which is very nice. ALSO been told at drivethrough the park on side and no one was even waiting behind me?? Had 2 items. Why have drive through if u make us wait? Seen others make this point to. Hope this review makes a difference. Leave a like if you agree with my points.\n\nSUMMARY\nPls improve! Manager owner. We understand that new people are hired everyday but other Mcdonalds do not have this problem, have them trained properly.\n\nCOOK FRIES PROPERLY WITH PROPER AMOUNT OF FRIES GIVEN CONSISTENLY WITH SALT! cook burgers so they are well done lil burn on em not under cooked with proper seasoning. Dont burn buns on breakfast sausage and egg.\n\nFIX BATHROOM PLS, offer paper towels to use to exit after washing hands and put garbage near to throw away, not just hand drier as everyone touches same handle and alot of people do not wash there hands!  or leave door open permanently with a wood stopper, or add automatic sensor to open door or replace door. Add another toilet, one toilet for a 60 seating restaurant is not enough. Renovate bathroom.\n\nDo not tell drivers to park on side when it is not busy. We go to drivethroughs cuz we are in a hurry. Add more staff to night shift food is always cold and not fresh especially fries and wait times are up to 40 min. HIRE MORE STAFF FOR NIGHT SHIFT.\n\nOreo mcfleury fill to top with ice cream and use more oreo or smarties etc not giving enough quantity .\n\nImprove coffee. Make sure to put what we order. 2 creams and 1 sugar, shouldnt taste like no sugar or no cream.\n\nThanks for listening and hope to see improvements in the coming week! Thank you staff and managers!",

Foods come out hot, quick turnover that means, and well trained staffs!\nIt's our go to in the morning before church on Sunday and course kids love happy meals.\n\nHowever franchise should focus on fair pricing as a fast food rather than returning capital to investors, and growing margin profile YoY.  Once it becomes higher price than a regular food, it won't last.\n\nChicken Mcmuffin was an interesting one! Mcflurry is so addictive.\n\nHah! Guess you have the rights to enforce those prices.",
