The burger buns were homemade as they meticulously explained. The beef patty was VERY DELICIOUS,  and juicy.  the steak was so smooth, and the sauce served along made it a memorable foodie experience. On the other hand, service was 10/10. They listened attentively to our feedback and was constantly making sure that all customers were satisfied with their experience. We thought the food to be a bit expensive when we first glanced at the menu, but we left thinking it was worth every penny. Will definitely go back!",
