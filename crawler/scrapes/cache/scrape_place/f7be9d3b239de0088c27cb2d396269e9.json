The ambience of the resturant is a dark and loud because of how packed it was. Overall, not bad, but I likely would not come back because it is not my preference.",

I had the lamb shank, it was super tender, fall off the bone delicious. There was enough for 2 meals.\n\nDefinitely has the old town vibe, but yet not tacky. Every server was nice and the bartender was great all night. Will be back on my own to try their full menu.",
