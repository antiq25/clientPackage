The food was delicious - we shared the veggie curry (which comes with fragrant rice, a beautiful salad and plantains), a side of roti and the coconut dumplings with mango butter (to die for!). The spicy plantain margaritas were amazing - our server added a special touch for us, so that made us feel pretty special. The staff were all so kind. After we left, we went back for dancing later. They played great music and it was a wholesome, fun vibe. The place is highly secure. We felt very safe inside despite it being in the DTES area.",

Had a reservation through open table app for 7:45.\nFirst impression: The place was mostly empty, after a brief miscommunication with the hostess (she couldn't read our name on the reservation so she brought the tablet to us to identify ourselves lol), we got taken down the steps and seated at our table. Cosy atmosphere, chill-vibes, we were really hungry so got to ordering right away. I asked for the iconic red stripe (Jamaican beer), was told that they didn't have any in stock. I opted for the rum punch. And boy was it punching! I couldn't finish mine, I found it too strong. Not a downfall on the barman, I'm just not really a rum person. We ordered spicy beef patties and jerk pork belly for starters, and curry goat meal and oxtail dinner for mains.\nFirst impressions experience: 8/10\n\nPatties: you get two with a choice of dip. The pastry was crisp and flaky, very light and enjoyable, the filling was plenty full, but not spicy at all. In fact I think it could've done with more seasoning. Overall - 8/10.\n\nJerk pork belly: oh lord! Sooooo goood! Good size portion for a starter (2 pieces), drenched in tropical salsa type sauce and served with 4 fried dumplings. I thought the dumplings were a little hard (the outer layer was too fried and hard), but overall good. The pork belly was well seasoned and definitely a highlight of the starters.\nOverall 9/10.\n\nCurry goat: comes in an old school lunchbox style containers, accompanied by rice and peas (peas were white though), and a green leaf salad mix. The goat was well cooked, falling off the bone, juicy, tender, but also, a little mild on the seasoning. Not much curry flavour coming through.\nOverall 7/10.\n\nOxtail: generally my absolute favorite Jamaican dish, unfortunately just like the curry goat, under seasoned. Very well cooked, comes off the bone completely as it should, no issues there, but lacks the authentic flavour that would be enhanced had the seasoning been portioned into the stew properly.\nOverall 6/10.\n\nService: attentive, friendly, smiling staff, no complaints at all.\nOverall 10/10",

This neighbourhood has significantly declined and there is barely any lighting - you have to know about this place to find it. The Dark and Stormy ($15) has ginger beer which I love, perfectly sweetened. My jerk chicken was moist but the flavour fell flat. There was almost enough sauce to mix with the rice (it'd be bland without sauce, which I think is normal for many cuisines!). Those were nothing to write home about, it was the fried plantain that was REALLY tasty; wish I had more than 2 slices. Overall, thought this was pricey for the quality and flavours. The server was sweet but couldn't remember if she took my order, and walked away before I could get my receipt. Notes: auto 20% gratuity for big groups. The basement turns into a dance floor at 10:30pm, so book in advance for resos close to that time. My friend recommended the coconut dumplings, which sound odd but I might try them next time I want to walk through DTES in the dark!",
