However most savoury dishes we had was overly salty and I can't seem to find a dish I really like throughout the 10 courses. This is my second time here trying the tasting menu, it changed a little bit but the second time is definitely more salty..\nI have some photos attached. The fish with rice , ravioli and the duck sauce and mushrooms were all too salty where I can't really enjoy the taste of the food itself too much.",

The dishes came out super fast, and the texture, flavourless, and display of the dishes was perfection. I could not pick out a single imperfection in any dish! I recommend everything, but especially the Chicken Fried Mitake, Summer's Bounty, Summer Bean Salad, BBQ Pork Collar, and Summer Strawberry dessert.\n\nThe cost is also way more affordable than other Michelins, and the portions are larger than other restaurants.

The highlight was definitely the first course, consisting of a selection of seven canapes, which were all fantastic. The weakest point was the last course, a somewhat insipid little cake bite (\"Douglas Fir malt crumb\"). All 10 of them really good quality dishes. We also tried the white wine they made in collaboration with Ursa Major winery. It was light, well rounded and very pleasant.\n\nA word on the pricing: the tasting menu is advertised as $165 per person, but when booking, in the very last step, right before paying, you'll notice there's a 20% service charge, which I found to be very misleading. With that plus tax, dinner for two came out to $412.50 (plus the wine, which I think came to about $20 per glass).\n\nThe service is very friendly. They explain all the dishes in great detail and are delighted to provide more insight. The one aspect that wasn't as enchanting is that as soon as we sat down, they tried to sell us additional options, like pre-selected wine paring, pre-selected wine and cocktail pairing, or just additional caviar or foie gras for our tasting menu, when we didn't even know what the menu was like, and without telling us the price for these add-ons upfront.\n\nOverall, great tasting experience, but for a hefty price.",

But, I think it could benefit being a smaller serving as by the end of the entire desert portion my palate felt fatigued and it had a bit of a diminishing return on the experience. Still great though!\n\nI would come back again!",

Everything from the food, to the service, and the atmosphere made it obvious why this restaurant earned a Michelin Star.\n\nThe standout dish to me was the octopus. This dish had a nice tang to it, and the octopus was tender and bursting with flavour. The ingredients for all dishes were nice and fresh. Particularly, the tomatoes used in the ravioli tasted homegrown - a taste unique to only the highest quality tomato. Overall, I would describe the flavour notes of our dishes to be zesty citrus.\n\nOne minor thing that stuck out to me was the plating of the pork collar dish. I found it a little awkward that the pork was only on one-third of such a large plate. It looked like most of the dish was missing.\n\nOther than that, our experience at Published on Main was fantastic!",
