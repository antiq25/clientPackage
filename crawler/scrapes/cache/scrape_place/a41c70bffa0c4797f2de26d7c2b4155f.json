My daughter loves it when we go to McDonald's after school  You pretty much know what you're going to get. The drinks are cold and refreshing. We were surprised that they still had plastic straws.  The filet o fish was fresh and tasty but it would have been better with more sauce and the sandwich especially since we asked for it and the fish was dry.
