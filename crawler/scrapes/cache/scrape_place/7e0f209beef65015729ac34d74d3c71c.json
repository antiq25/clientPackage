We were too full to try any dumplings while we were their but hopefully it will not be long wait for our next visit to this establishment.\n\nThe music playing did not fit the decor, but wow the washrooms where very unquie on how they decorated it with peacock designs.",

We love speakeasies and upscale, experimental cocktail bars but this was a flop for our party of four.",

The bison were nice, especially if you like a little kick in your dipping sauce (I do) the pork were the most traditional, the prawn and oyster were super soft and delicate - quite petit tho if you have a big appetite (also yes). The lamb cumin were a bit odd - not bad but not a flavour I don't associate with dumplings (which is why I ordered to be fair) they are quite dense too. The lunch deal is good with two servings and a soft drink for $12. I will say, even with two portions I could have eaten one or two more. All in all, good visit, good flavours, good service.",

The decor and lighting is dark with a nice ambience. Server super nice. Loved the drink menu concept and how each cocktail was part of a different story.\n\nThe food is best to be shared (there were four of us) and we ordered several things.\n\nI would definitely stay away from the the xiao long bao: the dumplings were extremely tiny and had no soup so I do not recommend!\n\nThe pork belly was our favorite thing on the menu because it was soft and fatty in all the right places. Covered and cooked in yummy sauce.\n\nThe drunken chicken was another favorite as well. The meat was soft and poached perfectly.\n\nI enjoyed the noodles but my coworkers found it too spicy.\n\nThe fried fish was delicious but again, on the smaller side.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my friends, I had the bison momo dumplings. They were good but nothing special. I thought that they were covered in way too much spicy topping.\n\nOverall, the place is a cool concept and great for drinks and the experience. The food menu could use some tweaking so I wouldn't come here expecting to be full and satisfied.",
