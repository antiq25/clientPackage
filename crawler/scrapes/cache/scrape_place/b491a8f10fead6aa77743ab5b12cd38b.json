So it all started with when i went there to have my dinner at this place and we didn't had any food since morning. We ordered in clear words a paneer masala roll and veg steamed momos. The order taker heard us wrong and she punched a chicken masala roll. My friend is a non-vegetarian person but it all comes to me i am a vegetarian person by birth and it's like i don't even eat eggs. We were so hungry that we started eating the wrap and also as i said above we didn't ate since morning so we didn't realised initially that we were served chicken but later my friend realised since he is a non-vegetarian person. As I complained to the order taker, she was like i always double confirm the order. But we clearly remember that we ordered a paneer masala roll and she didn't double confirmed with us as well. It was all her mistake and she knows that very well. And also in their apologies, when i asked sincerely can i know the name of order taker by any chance. She replied \"IT WILL AFFECT MY JOB\". Seriously, are you kidding me? It has affected my life. Just one mistake of order taker who was varsha has affected me mentally, can anybody imagine that she made a vegetarian person eat chicken. It comes under my religion and i am a pure vegetarian. It's high time to consider this review. That being said, at the time of ordering, we clearly also told her to cut the wrap in two halves. She was like yes, i'll do it for you. Later when i went to pick my food, i asked her, that is it in two halves already? She told me yes. When I opened the wrap it was in one full piece. I need to ask her again to cut in two. That clearly shows she didn't heard us right while taking the order. Such discrepancies while taking order shouldn't be considered that too to a pure vegetarian person, who never ate since born.",

So it all started with when i went there to have my dinner at this place and we didn't had any food since morning. We ordered in clear words a paneer masala roll and veg steamed momos. The order taker heard us wrong and she punched a chicken masala roll. My friend is a non-vegetarian person but it all comes to me i am a vegetarian person by birth and it's like i don't even eat eggs. We were so hungry that we started eating the wrap and also as i said above we didn't ate since morning so we didn't realised initially that we were served chicken but later my friend realised since he is a non-vegetarian person. As I complained to the order taker, she was like i always double confirm the order. But we clearly remember that we ordered a paneer masala roll and she didn't double confirmed with us as well. It was all her mistake and she knows that very well. And also in their apologies, when i asked sincerely can i know the name of order taker by any chance. She replied \"IT WILL AFFECT MY JOB\". Seriously, are you kidding me? It has affected my life. Just one mistake of order taker who was varsha has affected me mentally, can anybody imagine that she made a vegetarian person eat chicken. It comes under my religion and i am a pure vegetarian. It's high time to consider this review. That being said, at the time of ordering, we clearly also told her to cut the wrap in two halves. She was like yes, i'll do it for you. Later when i went to pick my food, i asked her, that is it in two halves already? She told me yes. When I opened the wrap it was in one full piece. I need to ask her again to cut in two. That clearly shows she didn't heard us right while taking the order. Such discrepancies while taking order shouldn't be considered that too to a pure vegetarian person, who never ate since born.",
