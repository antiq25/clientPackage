If our patients are unable to make it to the time they booked, they are welcome to call in and adjust their appointment 24 hours before their booked time. If our patients have an emergency or a legitimate reason, we usually waive the no show fee and end with a warning. Phone appointments are just as important as in-person appointments, which is why there is a no show fee for phone calls as well. If you still have any questions or concerns, please email us at info@forwardcaremedical.com and we will assist you the best of our abilities.\n\nThank you,\nFCM",

The clinic is quite busy most days, even during the pandemic, so expect a short wait before seeing your doctor.",

Too business type of services instead of a \"caring practice\".\nNo more than  2 questions allowed to ask  even if you have not seen them for so long!\nThe office is so crowded like a zoo!  I was put on hold with that terrible ding ding music every single call & you will be told that the next appointment will be a week later! I feel sorry for those sick elderly patients if they need quick assistance! Even worst is when the elderly don't even know how to book the appointment online! Terrible office management with too many doctors working for Dr Amanda Lau, the boss, who only works 2 days a week, few hours a day. Expecting the patients to accommodate her schedules so I requested to switch to one of her staff doctors but no spaces were reserved for us, the loyal patients! I will never come back to this office again!",

Unfortunately, we can only limit our patients to one or two concerns per appointment as there is a time restraint. If we allow our patients to go over the 10 minute limit, other patients would not be able to have their appointment on time. We do however encourage our patients to book multiple appointments if they have more concerns to discuss with our doctors.\n\nIf our patients require quick assistance, we do sometimes allow urgent same-day bookings. If you have any questions or concerns, please email us at info@forwardcaremedical.com and we will help you in the best way we can.\n\nThank you,\nFCM",
