I'm visiting from Ontario, and let me say that I've never had a McDonalds with the level of ambiance and service that I had here. First thing is first, this place is well maintained, from the lawn outside to the tables inside. The washroom is spotless.  The service is amazing, and staff are on and everything, making sure everything is done efficiently and amazing. I had the quarter pounder and fries, and it was the best McDonald's meal I ever had. The meat was absolutely flavor country. I'm glad I stopped in here.",
