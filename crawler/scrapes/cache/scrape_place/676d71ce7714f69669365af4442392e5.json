I came here to use my Plant Curious coupons, so ordered 2 vegan crepes (mango cream cheese and blueberry cream cheese), a gluten free classic pulled chick'un burger, and 3 chick'un tenders. There was only 1 lady working; she took the orders up front and prepared the food in the open kitchen space right behind the counter. We waited around 15 minutes for our order. When we went to pick up our food, one thing we did notice was that the staff member wasn't wearing gloves when handling the food, so we only trust that they were properly sanitizing in-between working up front and in the kitchen. She was friendly.\n\nThe chick'un tenders were the best part of the order. They had a crispy exterior and retained a meaty texture despite being vegan. The spices in the batter gave them a small kick of flavour. The crepes were disappointing, but because we got them at 2-for-1, it was fair for that price. We weren't sure if there was supposed to be more filling (\"cream cheese\") in-between the crepe folds, but it was primarily the fruit sauce on top that gave it flavour. The blueberry may have had a small amount of blueberry sauce inside, but there was no \"cream cheese\" to be found that we could see/taste. We were left wondering if it was mixed into the sauce. At a regular $10 each, we'd pass on this as it was otherwise a plain crepe with some sauce on top. The burger was decent and the vegan mayo and cheese options were appreciated. I only got the classic, so it was quite plain, but the chick'un had a soy-forward flavour that was passable as a meat substitute. The gluten free bun was one of the better buns I've had (fluffy and not flat).\n\nThe shop also sells different desserts (I'd assume made in house based on the packaging), and treats from other vendors and plant-based brands. Not everything is vegan, so I'd advise you to check the labels/menu and ask staff if you're unsure. If I was in the area, I'd recommend stopping by for the chick'un tenders or a treat as they're open late, but not for the crepes.",

I'm not sure if it was the sauce or if the fries already had salt as well, but it was just too salty to taste good.  The chicken tenders were really crispy. I liked how they put some Rice Krispies to make it even crispier.  One star is removed because there is no washroom here. How are people going to wash their hands? And since it has a place to sit down, people might need to use the washroom, especially if they need to drink stuff. I would definitely try here though if you are vegan, vegetarian or if you just want to try some vegan chicken. The chickun burger was really my favorite.",

From reading older reviews this was an omnivore restaurant, changed core offering to vegan fried chick'un and then pivoted to offer non-vegan (keto and such) items? I don't know, but I was sad about it. Tons of desserts (not labeled) on display and a formidable menu of items, including crepes and waffles, yet only a handful were vegan and less were actually available.\n\nWe ordered a vegan waffle, milkshake, and slice of cake. The waffle was good. The odd thing is we watched a full round waffle (4 sections) being made but were only served half (2 sections) of it. What do they do with the other half?? Lol The menu should say \"1/2 waffle\" if this is the standard serving size!\n\nVegan milkshake was very watery and not thick at all. Seemed like they don't use ice cream in it? Oatmilk, banana, and syrup? That's not a milkshake....\n\nVegan presliced cake was okay.\n\nWe felt bad for the workers. This establishment does not have AC but did have fans blowing the hot air around. It was ridiculously cooler outside than inside the store. One of the display fridges is open without glass or a plastic shield and was blowing hot air from the lower portion where it is missing a cover plate. This is a viscous cycle... it blows out hot air because it is trying hard to cool the food, but the food area has nothing to contain the cool air, so the motor runs harder, and the hot air gets hotter. These types of food service fridges do not belong in buildings without central air conditioning running.",

I've ordered their Buffalo Chick'un Burger multiple times and it's always so satisfying! Their choice of the hot sauce, jalapenos and cheese are a phenomenal combination! Just thinking about it makes me drool  When you take the first bite, you'd be surprised it's not real chicken. It's juicy and chewy and not dry at all! The times I've ordered here, it's always by phone. The staff are super friendly and know my name and order. They also have a huge selection of cakes all from the Cheesecake Factory so you can't go wrong! I've purchased their cakes before and if you're  into creamier, richer cakes, their selection will not disappoint.\n\nA must try for anyone vegetarian/vegan looking for a good chick'un burger and dessert.\n\nOnly down side is their pricing :( For just a burger alone, it's $14 +tax. I mean, the size of burger is actually quite big, but still a bit pricy for just a burger  Nonetheless, it is a place I frequent. So give it a try! :)",
