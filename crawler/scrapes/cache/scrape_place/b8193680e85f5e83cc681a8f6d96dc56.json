The Chicken & Crack Rice is another testament to the kitchen's prowess, offering comfort with a touch of sophistication.\n\nDespite its popularity, the restaurant maintains an efficient service, with quick seating and fast, friendly staff, even on a Sunday - which seems like the ideal time to go if you don't want to wait. The dining experience is enhanced by the ambience, characterized by an understated room with an open kitchen and industrial touches, complemented by a communal table for those who enjoy a convivial atmosphere.\n\nThe versatility of the menu caters to different palates, with lunchtime focusing on quick, rice bowl options and dinner revealing more adventurous dishes with European influences. With thoughtful services like air conditioning and card payment options, the restaurant ensures a comfortable visit for its guests.\n\nOperating hours accommodate a range of dining preferences, making it an ideal spot for both early and late meals.
