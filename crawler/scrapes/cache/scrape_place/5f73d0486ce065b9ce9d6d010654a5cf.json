She is kind to always ask if we have any further questions before wrapping up our appointment as well.\n\nI also had a blood test yesterday and I did not schedule a follow-up appointment.

Went out of their way to try and find our forms and information, which may seem silly but with my previous negative experiences with front desk people, this was a nice change.\n\nOffice space is nice and the people are warm and friendly. So happy we found this office.",
