This place is so underrated compared to the other Indian restaurant a few minutes east on the same street that's not nearly as good. I hope customers come here to try first before they go to the other ones. They have daily specials as well! Highly recommend!!",

The onion rava masala dosa was super crispy, generous portious and flavourful. The filling lacked salt, however once you eat it with the chutneys and sambhar, it works out.
