We had early reservations which you'll need to make at least a month in advance. We sat at the bar which had great ambiance. The staff did an amazing job of the small details and with the dishes. The charcoal udon was just so incredible. Out of the 6 dishes we got, the only one I did not enjoy as much was the salmon. It wasn't bad but I just found it not at the same level as the other dishes. Still for me five !",

Most of the dishes we had were exceptional and a couple just \"very good\" what impressed me the most was the unpretentious nature. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and she would look up some info if she didn't know that her than just make something up. It's expensive for sure, but like some other Michelin star restaurants you don't leave wondering if the food and experience were worth it. If you want to spoil yourself have the $90 Japanese truffle omelette... Wow!",
