Met up with some friends who lives in Vancouver and recommend trying Maenam.\n\nCute small Thai restaurant with a very cool modern vibe. Service was excellent with the server being super attentive.\n\nWe decided to go for their 13 course tasting menu. I wasn't able to post all the pics as it only allows me to add 10 pics to this post.\n\nThe food was so amazing, small amounts so you can taste the flavours and also so you won't get too full.\nThe tasting menu was interesting there was food that I otherwise would not have ordered at a standard thai restaurant.  The server explained each dish that came to the table.\n\nAll in all a very unique experience, the desserts were so good!\nIn love tasting menus. This one is a must try!!",
