We spend X amount of money each time to get our food. And this particular franchise employees were absolutely rude and disrespectful in their service to us. We ordered our food at the kiosk in store at 9:58 pm and got our food delivered after 45 mins. It was a total mess, on top of it there was a missing item. When asked for it, the manager asked us, if we were arguing just for the \"sake of a single milkshake\"??!! You kept us waiting for so long, our food wasn't delivered in a good way, there was a missing item and the poutine tasted horrible. Do you really think a customer who spends so much of money to buy food from your store and gets such a horrible experience would be happy with your brand?! The managers were so rude. They just wanted to refund the amount and kick us out and were not at all ready to talk. Really?? Do you think that would have made my child happy who slept off while waiting for the food??\n\nPlease train your employees or assign more employees to serve the customers who walk in to order their food in store, as much as they prioritise the drive through orders. Also, please train this particular manager how to deal with an unhappy customer. She was ABSOLUTELY RUDE. Her behaviour was a nonsense. It was very frustrating and insulting. She literally asked us to pick us things and get out. I have her picture with me. Please reach out and I can share her picture to help trace her down.\n\nI'm really hoping that you would take care of this. Please do not provide such a bad customer experience. It is very annoying and spoilt a very good evening of ours.\n\nMcDonald's\n17635 64 ave, Surrey, BC V3S1Z2",
