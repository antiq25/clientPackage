But the Brick Bread felt eerily similar and by far the best dish. Everything was incredible, and the mini surprise bites in between were all delicious.\n\nThe service... was outstanding. An incredibly well informed sommelier and servers that were kind and genuine, everyone was on their A game.\n\nProbably my favorite restaurant in the city",
