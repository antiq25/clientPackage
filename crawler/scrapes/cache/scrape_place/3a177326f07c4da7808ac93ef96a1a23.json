Unfortunately, it was marred by the behavior of the male pharmacist on duty, who was not only rude but also condescending. This kind of treatment is unacceptable, especially in a place that is supposed to provide care and support to customers.\n\nMy Mum, who is already dealing with health issues, should not have had to endure such disrespectful behavior from a professional who is meant to be compassionate and understanding. It left her feeling uncomfortable and hesitant to return to the pharmacy in the future.\n\nPharmacies should be safe spaces where people can trust the advice and assistance of the professionals working there. However, this experience at Loblaw Pharmacy shattered that sense of security and reliability. It is disheartening to see that a place that is supposed to cater to the health needs of the community fails to meet even the basic standards of customer service and respect.\n\nI hope that this review serves as a wakeup call for Loblaw Pharmacy management to address the issue promptly. It is crucial for them to reevaluate their staff's behavior and ensure that such incidents do not happen again. No customer, especially someone seeking medical help, should be made to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.\n\nGiven the negative experience my Mum had, I cannot recommend Loblaw Pharmacy to anyone until they address and rectify the situation. It is essential for any business to prioritize customer care, and in this regard, Loblaw Pharmacy has fallen short. As a result, I strongly advise seeking an alternative pharmacy where you can feel confident that you will be treated with respect and kindness during your visits.",
