In comparison to other health conscious 'build your own' bowls, Oja's Blend and Basil Box are better options for the price (especially with the protein). However, Gobble does have some unique options in their porchetta and smoked vegan chili. Their roasted root vegetables needed more seasoning as I found it on the bland side, but the pilaf was nice. My friend did enjoy their Chicken Bowl (with the honey glazed chicken and a mild spicy aioli). Would return if I'm in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip out like I did for my first visit.",
