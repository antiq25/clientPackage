The atmosphere is suited as being down to Earth and fairly laid back with a hint of formality, which is always nice. The food is good, but not great, considering the cost. The fish seemed relatively fresh, which was great. Presentation was good. However, for hot dishes, we received warm food that seemed like it was left out a while before getting to our table. I think this aspect could be improved upon. I would go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to wait in line to eat here.",

If you celebrate your anniversary or birthday, they will offer a complimentary pudding and sing a special song for you. It will be my number one if I want to enjoy the Japanese food. Definitely will let all my friends know and highly recommend if you want to try. Just in case, please remember to make your reservation.",

When we arrived, we were sat at the patio table where it is bright and breeze, very comfy. I was impressed with how attentive staff were. Water jug gets fill whenever close to empty, they remembered which member has food allergy and let the person know as we order.\n\nFor the great taste, good portion and amazing service, the price point is justified in my opinion.\n\nThe birthday star got a birthday song, dessert and polaroid photo from the staff. Totally made the day. Thank you for making this visit so so special.",

Thank you Raisu for making our last dinner in Vancouver (we are just visiting) so wonderful!",
