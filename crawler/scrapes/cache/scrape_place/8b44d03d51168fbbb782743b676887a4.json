The bathrooms were disgusting.  In addition, the service was very slow.  It's as though they had only 3 people working instead of 6.  At one point  two girls walked through the kitchen area and out from the cashier area in street clothes.  One of them took orders at the till in her street clothes then proceeded to help in the back with a lovely gentleman that was trying so hard to keep up to the fast pace of the orders all by himself.  The woman in street clothes was wearing flip flops.\n\nWe asked for our money back and left.  Yuck!",

This morning it took around 10 minutes to get through the drive-through then after getting my micro orange juice, went to go inside to get some ketchup for the hashbrowns which they didn't put in the bag & all doors were locked. A customer let me in. It appeared that there was a skeleton crew working. It seem like the poor lady was working the front tills as well as the drive-through, which explains the long wait at the drive-through, and they likely had to all the front doors locked so that people would use the drive-through rather than come inside. All the bathrooms were locked as well so overall, this was absolutely terrible experience at this location & I will not be back.",
