Located in the West End, down a set of stairs off Davie St, Arike is an approachable and global dining experience.\n\nEvery course had a remarkable variance in spice and heat, even the bread which contained bebere spice. My favourite courses were the Moroccan Ratatouille and the Sea Bream Ceviche. The ceviche was notably spicy, in a delightful way, and presented with a peanut hummus. I also had the wine pairing which was a stellar accompaniment.\n\nMy sister found the melon course with the serrano sofrito and yogurt foam as her favourite.\n\nThe meal was a wonderful progression from start to finish and we were delighted by it all.",
