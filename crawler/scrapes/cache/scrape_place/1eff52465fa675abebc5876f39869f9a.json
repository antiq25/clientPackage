Drinks were great but obviously it took some time to arrive on our table since there was only one guy to do all the tasks. Five stars only for him and i dont want to affect your restaurant ratings. I didnt get a chance to catch his name but if you are reading this.. you are doing a great job. U saved 4 stars for your restaurant otherwise i would have given only one star for food.",

This place was dirty - everything felt grimy, from the tables to the seats to the cutlery and the dinnerware was dirty with stuck on food. The food wasn't good and it was old and stale. The service wasn't very good and when your paying by card they they will try to make you pay a 15% tip which was not very fair due to the poor service, food, and atmosphere. 10/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND AND DO NOT COME HERE please save your hard earned money and spend it somewhere else and we won't be coming back!",

First time in Vancouver I experienced the all you can eat for a fixed price. Huge variety of Indian food and few Chinese food as well. CAD 26 with Tax and you can eat as you wish from the buffet. Lovely to see how the staff refills the buffet with closely paying attention. Taste level is 8/10..  Value for money 10/10",
