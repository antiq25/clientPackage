We then didn't see our server until after we were more than halfway done our entrees.  While the food was brought out quickly by the runners, no refills on drinks were offered at our table, while all other tables around us where receiving water refills constantly.\n\nWe went because of the prime rib special being offered for Labour Day weekend, and although I ordered it medium rare, it came out medium well.  Also, minor complaint...on the menu it says the prime rib comes with au jus, but it seems like it was a red wine au jus, and tasted rather sweet.  With no salt/pepper set on the table, and no check-up from our server, I ended up eating the now sweet tasting over-cooked prime rib.\n\nWe had great experiences at the restaurant previously, but this was enough to turn us away.  I don't think we will be returning.",
