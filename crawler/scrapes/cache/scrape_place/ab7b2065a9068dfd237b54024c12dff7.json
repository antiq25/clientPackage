Also, there was another asian female staff at pick up prescription area and she was super rude. I didnt understand what she told me was and i asked same question twice and suddenly both of staff(female pharmacist and pick up area staff) they were laughing in front of me which is ridiculous and very rude. This pharmacy needs to re-train your staff there, all the staff there was super rude and they need to learn how to greet customer and also need to learn how to smile at customer. I will never visit this pharmacy never again!! very unprofessional",

She think queen of the pharmacy or something. And she told me will be ready after 35min then when I pick up my staff they are not ready. I was waiting extra 1 hour..... Can you please hire good manger here?",

I haven't had much of a problem at the counter or with wait times, but the first few times I filled a prescription they kept forgetting or failing to bill my extended benefits. Annoying but not awful. My biggest challenge is refills. The phone number currently printed on the bottles is incorrect. The phone number listed on Google is also wrong. Even the automated system you get when you call Superstore sends you to the wrong number. I had to get someone at the customer service desk to tell me the number, hang up, and redial it directly. I picked this pharmacy because I recently moved nearby and I usually get my groceries at Superstore, so this seemed like an easy decision. How could it be less convenient than driving 25 minutes across town to my old pharmacy near my old apartment? Superstore accepted my challenge and exceeded my expectations.",
