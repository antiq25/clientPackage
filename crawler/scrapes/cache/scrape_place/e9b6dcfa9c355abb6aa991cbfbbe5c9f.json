Date 29 September @12:40 pm My wife complained that when she went there to try their promo eat all you can she was told that its $16.40. Since my wife has only $15.00, she went back to my table to get her purse. So she gave him $16.00+ 40 cents. ( the $16 is loose paper and coins) He took it and put in his till.  And he said that it is only $15.00. My wife  insisted she gave him the correct amount. But the cashier guy denied it. She backed out and said to return my money. He still insisted and returned only $15.00.  So my wife lost some of her money. Very, very terrible customer service.  Not recommeded to eat in this outlet.",

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you and your wife faced during your recent visit. We take customer feedback seriously and would like to address this matter.\n\nFirst and foremost, we're deeply sorry for any misunderstanding regarding the counting of the payment.  This certainly does not reflect our usual standard of service. To ensure it doesn't happen again in the future, I have investigated and found out some details. As you noted, there was quite a bit of coin so there might have been a miscount somewhere. In hindsight, the staff agreed that he could have done differently to avoid upsetting you.  He admitted that he was also under pressure that the store was busy with other guests waiting to be served.\n\nWe highly value our customers, and it's disappointing to hear that you had a negative experience. We would like to make amends for this. Kindly reach out to our management team with your phone number at feedback@thaiaway.com so we can resolve this matter to your satisfaction.\n\nOnce again, we apologize for the inconvenience, and we hope you'll give us another chance to provide you with the excellent dining experience we strive to offer.\n\nSincerely,\nSiripon\nThai away home restaurant",
