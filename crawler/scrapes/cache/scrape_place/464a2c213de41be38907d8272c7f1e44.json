The service is wonderful they accommodated us just at closing time and they're really friendly and share books about the tragic history of Canadian First Nations. It's poignant reading about the owner's personal experience while reading through the menu. We ordered the upgrade to turn a main course into a 3 course meal. The first thing that hits you, literally in the gut, is how heavy the bannock is. It's so heavy and filling it could be a meal on its own. About the size of a large dinner roll with the weight of 7 of them. But it was surprisingly soft, natural tasting and great with butter. There was a beef and celery soup with so much shredded meat and celery it could have been a stew. Dipping bannock in it was great. We also had mushrooms and gravy on another large bannock. This was so good. The highlight was rubbed grilled salmon on wild rice. This was exceptional and we didn't finish it so we could share it with our daughter. Ice cream with berries was an excellent close. Let me not forget to mention 2 indigenous beers a vanilla porter that reminds you of a dark English beer and a Saskatoon berry that reminds you of a sour lager.",

The menu was proudly described to us which helped us make our selections and this enhanced our dining experience. We were invited to take our leftover bannock home. Extra points for reducing food waste. The service was wonderful. Reservations recommended as the restaurant has limited seating. Several groups of walk-ins were turned away while we were there.\nThere's paid parking at the back but it's difficult to access the restaurant from the upper lot if you have mobility issues as the elevator is not in service.

Others especially the main courses are just so so and tastes not very distinctive. All the side dishes are the same - not much a variety to share. Drinks (Berries gone wild, Elderflower refresher) are not that impressive too.\nI suggest not to order bannocks as starter as all main courses include a bannock with butter.

A friend and I wanted to try but weren't sure on the timing of when we'd be ready and so didn't make a reservation for Sunday, and we got really lucky - we called ahead and first they said they had room on the patio only, but then shortly after we arrived they'd had a cancellation so we did get a table inside. During the few minutes we were on the patio, though, they wanted to make sure we were comfortable and brought me a blanket since I was cold. But it was nice to sit inside to see all the art they have up.\nTo warm up, I got a wild rice tea (which is a caffeine-free infusion, not technically a tea), which was surprisingly rich-tasting. If you like genmaicha, this was a similar idea without the tea. For my meal, I had their vegetarian risotto, which rotates and was butternut squash on that day. My meal included a piece of bannock which they brought out first, which was like a cross between a dinner roll and rich biscuit and very good. Sometimes I find risotto boring, but this one was fantastic, with the rich earthy flavours of the risotto complimented by the seasoned roasted vegetables it was topped with. My friend was a fan of her salmon burger too, and said the bannock as a bun made it interesting and different. I tried one of her sweet potato fries and really liked it - more interesting than regular fries for sure. To finish, we ordered a blueberry bread pudding. I really like bread pudding but my friend had never tried it, but we both enjoyed it! The texture of the bannock in bread pudding was a little different but worked well!\nMy meal came to $57 after tip and tax, but it was well worth it for the nice experience I had (and I left full), and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to both foodies and people looking to get a taste of Indigenous culture.",

Highly recommend this restaurant.",
