            "response_from_owner_text": "Hi Ashley. So I'll explain why I'm asking you to wait. Basically I only take on 1 client in a day if it's a standard SMP Correction / or touch up. With people who have a large area or full scalp correction ( like yourself having alopecia) I want to give you / all my clients a high quality result and a quality SMP session. So I need 1 day free before your session and 1 day free after. I do this to keep my wrists fully rested and healed for each client. Most company's take on multiple clients in a day and they have you on a time clock. When they do this they just spread out your smp Pigmenting and keep asking you to come back in for more sessions(sometimes 4 to 6 sessions). But with my business, I want to try my best to get everyone done in 2 sessions. (90%) of my clients are done in 2 sessions. Because I take my time and again only take on 1 client in a day or every other day when doing large sessions. So you have me at my best rested self. I'm all about quality over quantity. I don't think its fair if I took multiple clients in a day. The second or third client wouldn't have me at my fully rested self. I put in 5000 to 15000 smp hair follicle replications on average per session. So my wrists need rest.\n\nAs for you, the LGBTQ community, Or any human being in this world. Your sexual orientation, race, mindsets, religions, or any personal things have nothing to do with Scalp Micropigmentation.  I'm here to help anyone in need of SMP of any backround I don't discriminate. Your scalp and getting you a good high quality SMP outcome is great for us all. It's good for business and also for you to be happy is my goal. So shoot me a text or email anytime and I'll book you in for when im fully rested so we can get you the result you want. Thanks  ",
