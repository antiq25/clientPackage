I paid a fee out-of-pocket to the incorrect company and have had to go through multiple rounds of back-and-forth with multiple people.\n\nNow, my personal medical information is in the hands of a third-party that it should never have gone to and I have to pay even more money on top of what I already paid, to fix an error that is not my doing.

We have also seen Dr Cubra on occasion when Dr Vasquez has been away. Both doctors are incredibly patient, empathetic, and knowledgeable with relationships to other fantastic specialists in the community.\n\nDr Vasquez is hardly ever late for an appointment - sometimes he is a few minutes early. On the rare occasion I have waited an additional 5-10 minutes but this is a far departure from our previous GP. I can't believe had become accustomed to\nwaiting 1 hour + elsewhere.\n\nWhen this clinic moved into our neighbourhood a few years ago, I happened to ask the receptionist which doctor I should see and they told me that ALL of them were amazing.

It has been hours since I left a voicemail. They have missed setting up specialist appointments. Certainly don't trust them to do what is asked.

It feels very welcoming and is always super clean!\n\n- All the ladies at the reception are so lovely, patient and helpful. I find their service always friendly and I never feel rushed when booking an appointment or asking a question, even though they are very busy!\n\n- I use the walk-in clinic here and Dr. Cubra is absolutely amazing. He is the kindest doctor,  very patient, understanding, trustworthy and extremely knowledgeable. I never feel rushed and he always takes the time to listen to my symptoms and explain his recommendations. I truly believe he goes above and beyond for all the patients he sees. He has been an extremely huge help (especially this year) for me and I am so thankful for him and this clinic. The team at this clinic...they are the best!\n\n- I have never felt I had to wait an unreasonable amount of time, which is amazing for a walk-in clinic. And if they feel I have, they always apologize which just shows how thoughtful they are.\n\nThank you so much, Marine Gateway MC. I so appreciate all you do for me and the other patients you see.",
