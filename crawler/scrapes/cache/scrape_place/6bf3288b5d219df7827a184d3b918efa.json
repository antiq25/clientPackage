They cook their Tamago, the egg omelet sushi themselves, unlike some sushi places buy from market. Their Tamayo is very uniquely flavored with strong fragrance. Their Toro tastes buttery, and their octopus is actually soft. Unlike some octopus from other sushi restaurants that taste like chewy rubber. They proudly showcase the fresh, raw taste and texture of each ingredient with delicate seasonings. Service is great, and you get your food served fast. If there's a reason why they only open for 3 hours a day, it would probably be that they want to offer a high quality of restaurant experience. Definitely recommend.",
