My husband and I were already talking about what to order on our next visit as soon as we got into our car after the meal.\n\nThere were 5 of us tonight and we had:\n\n1. Deep fried meat dumplings - meaty fillings in crispy wrappings.\n\n2. Seafood and green onion pancakes - it was the best Korean seafood pancake we've had in Vancouver. The dough was light but it was filled with seafood goodness. The outside was perfectly fried with crunchy and crispy edges.\n\n3. Beef short ribs in sweet soy sauce - The flavour of the dish rendered it as my mom's favourite. The meat was tender and charred to perfection.\n\n4. Plain pork belly - This was my favourite. All the pieces were also charred nicely and they were heavenly with the accompanying dipping condiment (salt and spices in oil).\n\nService was excellent. The staff were friendly and attentive.\n\nI love this place.",

Featured here:\n\nBibimbap\nHaemul Soondubu\nHaemul Pajeon (Seafood and Green Onion Pancake)\nSweet Rice Drink\n\nBibimbap is usually served sizzling hot in a stone bowl. The rice at the bottom gets crunchy, and the whole dish in general tends to be a very warm, hearty and comforting meal. This Bibimbap however, was served to me in a metal bowl. Not only did it come in a metal bowl, but the rice was served separately from the veggies and fried egg, in a smaller separate bowl. This was really quite a disappointment as I'd been looking forward to have the sizzling hot bowl of rice that I'd come to expect from Korean restaurants.\n\nThe Haemul Soondubu on the other hand arrived at the table with bubbling hot soup in it. This was my second choice and I really wish that I had ordered this instead.\n\nThe Haemul Pajeon was nicely done, and the sweet rice drink which I hadn't had for a number of years, was as tasty as I remembered it being.\n\nThere were other meat dishes on the table but people started eating before I could take any photos! The meat dishes were already prepared though. This wasn't the kind of Korean BBQ where you get to cook the food yourself on a grill. That was a bit of a disappointment as we'd brought an out of town visitor here, and had hoped to give him the experience of Korean BBQ cooking at this dinner. From the name of the restaurant, we thought there would be grills on our table, but...that wasn't the case.\n\nService: Good\nParking: Free parking on the side street\nLocation: 2408 Nanaimo St., Vancouver, BC",

I have had seafood pancake at other restaurants and it has been uncooked or too much dough. This was the perfect green onion seafood pancake, the dough was soooo crunchy and the fillings so fresh, HUGE portion and the hot plate it comes on keeps it hot for the entire meal. I ate the leftovers cold the next day and it was great that way as well .Our server was kind and helpful , I will for sure be back 5/5!",

Highly recommend the Sweet Soy Deung Galbi Jjim. Excellent flavour and the meat just fell off the bone. The Ddukbokki was a bit disappointing this time. It was too soft and mushy, not the chewy texture I was hoping for. Overall, this is a great restaurant in an area with not many Korean food options. I would recommend it!",
