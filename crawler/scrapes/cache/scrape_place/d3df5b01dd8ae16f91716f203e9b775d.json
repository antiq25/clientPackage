Unfortunately, to my dismay, they were out of apple pies during my visit. It was quite disappointing as it's a signature item that I always look forward to when visiting McDonald's.\n\nThe absence of the apple pie made me reconsider my order, and I ended up getting a refund, which didn't quite hit the spot. I understand that inventory issues can happen, but it's disappointing when a staple item like the apple pie is unavailable.\n\nOn the positive side, the rest of the meal was as expected from McDonald's - tasty and satisfying. The service was relatively quick, and the staff was friendly. However, the lack of apple pies did put a damper on the overall experience.\n\nI hope McDonald's takes note of this issue and ensures a more consistent supply of their signature items in the future to avoid similar letdowns for other customers.",
