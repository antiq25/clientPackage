            "review_text": "This place is everything about how sushi should be like! They make their own Wasabi in traditional style, use fresh, and choose not to over do the flavor. They cook their Tamago, the egg omelet sushi themselves, unlike some sushi places buy from market. Their Tamayo is very uniquely flavored with strong fragrance. Their Toro tastes buttery, and their octopus is actually soft. Unlike some octopus from other sushi restaurants that taste like chewy rubber. They proudly showcase the fresh, raw taste and texture of each ingredient with delicate seasonings. Service is great, and you get your food served fast. If theres a reason why they only open for 3 hours a day, it would probably be that they want to offer a high quality of restaurant experience. Definitely recommend.",

For me, there is no better way to judge a Japanese restaurant than by its Chirashi Don, a colourful assortment of fresh seafood artfully arranged on a bed of sushi rice. The Chirashi at Kazu is definitely high-quality with a standard selection of seafood that included sockeye salmon, maguro, saba, ika, tako, masago and tobiko. I wish they offered a deluxe option with some ikura and uni. Also, ordered some amaebi sushi; they served the heads, deep fried, sprinkled with salt without asking. The deep fried heads were a treat. The Chirashi is a little pricier but definitely worth the premium for a little slice of Japan. Highly, highly recommend Kazu for fresh, high-quality seafood without any of the upscale restaurant prices.",

Food was excellent but our orders came out one after another so we didn t really eat at the same time. But the food was excellent, hot, fresh and some of the best sushi. Fresh wasabi was a nice touch. Some of the portions were a little small eg edamame, salmon sashimi but other meals were good. All hot meals were very fresh as was the sushi. Service was good but as mentioned before a little slow which was probably  because we were a party of 5.  Would definitely go again but probably with a smaller party.  Definitely more authentic vs your typical high volume place.",

The chefs strength is on traditional nigiri such as Toro, Hamachi, Aji. Meanwhile the nigiri and maki is good, the fusion rolls is passable. It also have a wide variety of hot meals to choose from, that will satisfy people who likes sizable portions and fullness. Nevertheless, they dont stand out as much as the sushi. I would recommend this restaurant as a daily / weekend go-to for families.",

The rice they use for their sushi is great quality, not compressed and cheap quality that you find at some of the other sushi restaurants.   Next on my list to try out is their Udon and sashimi, but based on their track record I am confident that it will be top notch as well.  Their only downside (if you can consider it a downside) is that this is the worst kept secret in town - they are very popular on Fridays and Saturdays, you will wait up to an hour for your takeout order, so be prepared to plan around that.",

Food: top notch, always fresh, high quality sushi and the rice has the perfect tanginess. They use real wasabi! I always get the deluxe assorted sushi if we are there for dinner. Their lunch boxes are very reasonable. Japanese ambience: Chef Kazu is at the sushi bar and you can watch him work his magic if you sit at the sushi bar. You can sometimes see his old friends swing by for a meal and a chat like my dad used to do at his friend s sushi bar so it s nostalgic to me. The music is usually bossa nova or something jazzy which at first doesn t seem Japanese but bossa nova music is extremely popular in Japan. My guess is that the owner is a huge bossa nova fan. Love the written menu items taped on the wall. Just the perfect hole in the wall gem. When ordering takeout, call early.",

One of the best sushi places Ive been to in Metro Vancouver - and when you consider the very reasonable price - best value pick! Service was great (servers are Japanese) and the Sushi Chef is very friendly (go chiso sama deshita)! We made a reservation which was a good idea as the place was packed at 6:15 pm when we arrived (always a good sign).  You can park at the nearby Safeway if you cant find any free street parking. One interesting feature which I loved was their authentic wasabi (as opposed to the usual paste you get everywhere else). Everything we ordered was delicious - melt in your mouth goodness. In addition my son ordered a side of tonkatsu and it was also really good - juicy pork just like in Japan.  This was our first visit and well definately be back - only 5 minutes east of the 2nd Narrows Bridge in Burnaby Heights",

            "review_text": "Kazu is an authentic Japanese run restaurant located in North Burnaby. Everyone from the waiters to the sushi chefs are Japanese. Their service and care for food is definitely different than what you would find at your local sushi joints. We arrived just past 6:00PM on a Friday night. The place was pretty packed with a couple of reserved tables left empty. We were greeted immediately upon entering and asked how many we had in our party. There was a group ahead of us when we arrived but we were both seated fairly quickly (within 5 mins). The restaurant itself is relatively small that seats about 30-35 people at maximum occupancy so there is likely going to be a wait during peak hours. After being seated, we were served with our menus and green tea. The first thing we noticed was that the tea is not your typical powdered green tea. It had a fully body to it and tasted great. The staff are really attentive and as soon as we shut our menus, there was a staff eager to take our order. We ordered the Kazu Maki, Yam Tempura Roll, and Tonkatsu. The food came relatively quickly (about 10 mins for the Kazu Maki and everything else within 15 mins). The presentation was great but the best thing was the absolute clean taste of each dish. It is seldom that you get the opportunity to really taste the different flavours stand out individually in each dish. Nothing mushed together in a mess and everything tasted awesome. The Kazu Maki was tasted fresh. The ingredients that went into it were all high quality and this was evident in the taste. The Yam Tempura Roll is lightly battered and lightly fried before they put in the roll (along with sprouts and mayo). The yam had a nice bite and wasnt mushy at all. The Tonkatsu was absolutely amazing. The pork cutlet was fried to a perfect crisp but left the meat inside tender and juicy. Best of all, it was not greasy and was thick. Seldom can you really taste what youre eating when you order tonkatsu as it is generally all pretty thin and fried to oblivion but this was not the case. The pork taste was evident and it was phenomenal. It came with the tonkatsu sauce that was nice and thick as well as some vegetables that provided a change in texture and cleaned your palette. Something that we noticed midway through the meal. The wasabi that is given looks to be hand grated (not the stuff you get from a tube). When we tried it, it was much different to the tubed wasabi. It didnt have that overpowering spice and was nice addition to the Kazu Maki. Overall, this place is a great choice for authentic Japanese cuisine that you can find locally. We would highly recommend this restaurant to any friends or family.",
