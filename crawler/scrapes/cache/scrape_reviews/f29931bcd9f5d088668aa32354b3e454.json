The food is fresh and made from scratch and the service is friendly. I am here often because their specials are sometimes cheaper and quicker than making food at home and they have air conditioning for when its just too hot to cook. Our favorites are the channa masala, chicken masala and vindaloo. Vegetarian options: They have a whole list of vegetarian curries Dietary restrictions: Most of their curries have gluten in them Parking: Parking along Kingsway and in the neighborhood",

The service was very polite and pleasant. Answered all our questions . Rice is a side dish which is the way I like it when it comes entrees. This allows for people like diabetes to order off the menu including vegetarian dishes with our having to worry about starch and sugar... Yay. We have the tandoori chicken  and wonderful dip for the chicken. I think it was cilantro. I of course had the chicken curry and was allowed to select how much heat I wanted for my dish. We also had a few vegetable side dishes too. The garlic Naan was so   yummy",

I stumbled upon this establishment by coincidence and am extremely grateful for having our paths crossed. The service was exceptional. My server was patient and helpful when ordering. I had many questions and all were answered to my satisfaction. The food arrived shortly after placing my order. I live in Surrey and have had many experiences with Indian food, however, Grace of India truly pushed the boundaries of what is expected of a typical Indian dish. The flavour was perfectly seasoned and quite bountiful. I asked for medium spicy and it was perfect. There is much more to say and are all positive. The experience was enriched with the excellent service and the refreshing glass of iced water. I felt comfortable and am happy to recommend Grace of India to anyone who enjoys quality Indian cuisine. I leave you with these last words. Many are outspoken about having quality over quantity, but at Grace of India, you get the opportunity to experience both. Please be sure to afford yourself the opportunity to experience their excellent Monday Special!",

Weather youre here just for some samosas and masala tea or some amazing curry with naan you will leave this place satisfied and happy My favorite meals are Eggplant Bartha, Fish Korma, Rogan Josh, Lamb Masala and of course butter chicken!!! Actually, there was never a time when i did not enjoy the food i have ordered here. Oh and also their raita is perfect Love the Grace Of India soooo muuuuch!!!",

Mondays are of course their infamous lunch special day for $8.99 which is a steal of a deal for the fresh, delicious, well portioned meal.  We get a bit more spice added to ours.  I find asking for a 7 out of 10 gives the kick I love in Indian food.  They have yummy papadan for gluten free folk and they will alter if necessary the veggie ones to be vegan if asked.  Most have milk but will do coconut milk and leave out paneer if specified as all made from scratch.  Very friendly family and always clean and welcoming. Were going to miss them when we move. :(",
