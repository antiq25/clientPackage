We went with ala carte because there were assume options that were not available thru the tasting menu and it didnt disappoint. Definitely order their signature dish Kanpachi Crudo if you want one of the most unbelievable dishes to that weve ever had.  We also ordered the burrata, chicken wings, bison tartare, beef ribs and duck breast followed by cheese cake for dessert. Everything was amazing and well definitely be back. Staff were also knowledgeable, fantastic, friendly and extremely efficient.",

Service was friendly and the decor was elevated and modern. Chef Steve Kuan is super talented, very deserving of his michelin recommended status 2 years in a row! Some highlights were the short rib, halibut, tartare, crudo and cheesecake! If you re around for lunch, his Taiwanese beef noodle soup is super authentic and the best i ve found in Vancouver. I will definitely be back soon!",

Simple decor, really attentive and active staff. The Chef Tasting Menu is highly recommended. Starters: Mussels (5/5) - Fresh, the miso butter is to die for, I almost licked the plate to the last drop. Bison Tartar (5/5) - melt in the mouth texture, comes with fried wonton wrapper to scoop everything in. Rice crisp are a fun surprise in the texture. Hiramasa Crudo (5/5) - citrusy, Gingery and again melt in your mouth soft texture. I need more than an appy size for this one. Burrata Salad (4/5) - Fresh salad and Burrata. Mains: Black Cod (5/5) The tomato dashi broth can be scooped up with the dinner rolls. Highly recommended wiping the plate clean, fennel adds an extra freshness to the already tasty broth - Cod was well done and soft. Desserts: Magic Stick. (5/5) The Praline leaf was delicately done, milk chocolate mousse and dark chocolate ganache was a good combo! Such intricate cooking and taste combinations is what makes this place amazing. Perfect place for a date night for sure!",

As usual, great recommendation! 5 hungry, gourmet food loving adults were pleasantly surprised by the 7-course Omakase Tasting Menu Dinner. $70./person +tax+tip. Appetizers: Bison Tartare, Burrata salad, Mussels were all excellent! Mains: Duck & Black Miso Cod with accompanying starch (Pain au Lait & steamed Bai buns w side of Foie gras) were perfectly done with great taste sensations. Use the bread & Bao bun to dip into the sauce &/or make a wrap! Dessert: Basque Cheesecake was the best.Creme Caramel & Chocolate Ganache were also very good. The ambience was minimalist but comfortable. It could use a bit more  warmth  or  ambience . Service was fantastic & flexible. We finished at 10pm (past their closing time but never felt rushed). It s several blocks away from the downtown East Van so need to be a bit careful not to walk east late at night. Go west! Great gourmand experience !! GO!",

I particularly like the Petty Wap, the lobster sauce blends in nicely with the fettuccine and seafood. The menu changes from time to time, also the presentation of the dishes. Dont be surprised to see the same dish presented a different way the next time you visit. All in all, a great restaurant to hang out with friends but not so much with family tho :)",

We are 6ft and 6ft + tall guys.  The only reason I marked down on the value was because we were debating between omakase special $65/pp and a la carte and realized it s actually cheaper when we order a la carte and get to choose what we want.  End up around $59/pp + tax and tip (5 appy 2 main & shared among 3 of us) and it was filling. Conclusion:  its worth going again, this time I might put our height on the special note for special seating accommodation  . See caption for the food descriptions",

I am not sure if the menu we were served were stable items seasonal but if you see the duck risotto you MUST try it! It will heal your soul!!! The Thai milk tea panna cotta is one of the best thing Ive tasted in a long time and if you think you have no more room for dessert, go run around the block and come back for it! You cannot end your meal without it!!! The restaurant is known for taking traditional Japanese cousin elevating them with a modern and unexpected twist and this is carried out to their drink menu. The cocktails are fun, delicious and better than many other higher end restaurants. Definitely recommend this place for date night, friends gathering and even if you just drop in for some drinks. They are priced reasonably and its one of those restaurants that you do get enough portions so go with friends and loved ones and have a wonderful amazing time!",

I started with an Emarosa while waiting for my partner, which was a sweet, delicate cocktail that reminded me of the jellies I would devour as a kid - but in a more elevated, elegant version. Absolutely delicious. We then had the beets, the poutine, and the steak. Every single dish was absolutely delectable. The beets were beautifully marinated, and the accompanying mushrooms and garlicky goodness was seriously top-notch and flavour-packed. The poutine (while definitely not a poutine and very deserving of the many question marks on the menu) was an amazing play of textures and rich, delicious duck. The crispy-creamy polenta and the gorgeous gravy was extraordinary, and the fresh pop from the tomatoes kept it from veering into overly heavy. Of all the dishes, definitely the most out there (especially, and I must stress this, if you are expecting any sort of traditional poutine), but also incredibly well-balanced. And finally, the beef. While the rest of the dish was extraordinary, with the two different but equally umptuous radish/turnips and sweet puree and beautifully textured potato (the crust! The soft lovely layers!), the standout was of course the beef. Expertly flavoured and cooked perfectly, yes, and just extremely tender and with a positively luscious mouthfeel .... What an incredible night, what a fantastic meal, and great decor and an intriguing open kitchen, too! Absolutely 100% worth visiting.",

The sashimi/tataki appetizer we had was really good with the perfect balance of fish, wasabi and citrus. Mains of roasted pork belly was really good with perfect crunchiness and seasoning as well as portion size. I really enjoyed their incorporation of texture into their dishes such as the fried quinoa on top of the appetizer and the puffed corn on top of the mains. 2nd time here: Loved the beef tartare dish! Also loved their cauliflower and brussel sprout dish with chickpeas - probably my favourite dish of the night!. Wagyu beef was not the best, the sides didnt work the best with the meat and the bonito flakes on top sadly masked the true meat flavour  - not worth the price. But the rest was good and would come back to try more of their menu! Especially their drink menu which is really interesting!!",

We selected the classic 5-course meal which was pre-booked and pre-ordered ahead of time. Every single dish was so flavourful, unique, fresh, delicious, and beautiful. The first two of our courses were taking rather long but the server noticed this and as an apology, they gave us an extra appetizer which we were not expecting at all. Not only this, but to reinforce how bad they felt they even gave us an extra dessert course! We were completely stuffed after but everything was so so yummy and we were so appreciative of their nice gestures to apologize for the long wait time. We also ordered one of their sake cocktails (and a glass of wine) which were great. Overall we completely enjoyed our meal and our experience here and would 100% recommend it to anyone looking for amazing asian-fusion!",

The restaurant was full and there were only 2 servers - they did a good job and were very friendly. Highly recommended.",

My partner and I were not going to order any drinks when we went until we saw how interesting and delicious they sounded. We ordered the O my Sake, and it was the best sake cocktail i have ever had. It also looked beautiful, truly a great experience for all senses. The Roasted Beets and Kanpachi Crudo were easily the best dishes we had. Im not sure how they made walnuts taste fluffy, but it was phenomenal. The sauce used for the Kanpachi Crudo was perfect, smokey and buttery, full of umami. Although the service could have been better, this is the perfect restaurant is you want high class food in a small, intimate setting. Vegetarian options: They have some great veggie options available.",

Overall, the recipients were grateful that they were able to enjoy such delicious food at home from Torafuku during their first week as parents.

All the food on the menu is good, however I recommend trying their flavoured sake and magic stick for dessert!! *spoiler alert - the servers come out singing :)",
