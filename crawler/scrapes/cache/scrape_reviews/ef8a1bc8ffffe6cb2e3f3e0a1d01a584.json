No problem having leftovers tomorrow lol. Each tamale is hefty and both the corn and the filling are moist and flavorful. I like mine saucier but even without added sauce theyre so so good. Pictured below are the pork with red sauce (medium spice) and the vegan version which are both very nice",

Please know that we pack our food with care especially when its for delivery, we even put all drinks in a plastic bag to prevent spills from happening. Uber eats and Doordash drivers are told to carry the food with the utmost care. Unfortunately, its out of our control how they handle orders once the food leaves our kitchen. Come visit us at our location and we will make it up to you. Hope to see you soon, - Antojos y Sabores Team",
