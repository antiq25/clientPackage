Service was amazing, but most importantly the food was so good. I had the lamb shank, it was super tender, fall off the bone delicious. There was enough for 2 meals. Definitely has the old town vibe, but yet not tacky. Every server was nice and the bartender was great all night. Will be back on my own to try their full menu.",

            "review_text": "We initially planned on going to Jam, as Victoria has one that we love. Upon arrival, the line went back a quarter of the block. So we started looking at reviews right outside of Chamber restaurant trying to figure out our next step. It was then that we saw it served brunch as well and had excellent reviews. We put our name down for a reso for 2 and were sat 20 minutes later at the bar. This Belgian-themed restaurant has gorgeous exposed wood with thick posts and cross beams creating a cozy atmosphere.  They have put a lot of money into the design of this place and I appreciated the beauty. Brunch was not your traditional bennies and bacon and eggs. I am a big breakfast person. I need breakfast food to start my day. Especially on the road. Chambers menu has a light grasp on the traditional breakfast, but in the best way possible. There were still eggs perfectly cooked, sausage full of flavor and a beautiful integration of fruit sides in the way of  julienned apples, and pineapple salsa. The balance of our dishes was impressive. I ate the pork dish quicker than I would normally eat my breakfast. Each bite and combination of flavors tasting like more. I also had the lemon drop with sparkling wine, which was a very refreshing beverage, having already had my morning coffee intake. The prices are higher end, but the dishes are well thought out and well worth the price.",

I, of course, was drawn by the reviews and the positive feedback of other patrons  experiences, but these were not fluff marketing ploys. The food was absolutely amazing! The dishes were unique in both presentation and taste. If you want something DIFFERENT and novel, then this is the place. It may sound corny, but the medley of ingredients that were activating my taste buds was incredible. I m really curious what the other dishes taste like and that s why it s worth revisiting. The vibe was upbeat and you are made to get into that personable mindset, as the staff members seem to be - from the reception to the initial greeting at the table and the overall service. I would have preferred the tables and seats to be a bit farther apart for more semi-privacy, but packing in that many patrons also made business sense. It was my uncle s treat and I think the servers already got the cue from that considering he was the more senior at our table and staff members were engaging him more, but the servers also were not short of properly addressing us when it was our turn to say something. Acknowledgement of presence was never short and I loved it about their service. They re absolutely attentive and also steadfast. If the water levels on glasses were low, someone was on it and they had that open-hands stance about their demeanor in engaging us. Someone would swing by every now and then to check in on us and the staff members were not snoots. This is probably the best experience I ve had in a while. The restaurant is worth a try EXPERIENCING.",

The restaurant is very modern with a hip vibe. I arrived during brunch, but I didn t want brunch so had to wait until 11:30 am when they open their lunch and dinner menus. So I had some Mimosas cocktail while I waited. The mimosas was made with freshly squeezed orange juice. They also have fresh grape fruit and watermelon juice. I sat at the bar since the place was packed and I didn t have reservations. The bar tenders were so nice and very amazing service. I ordered the Congolaise coconut curry mussels with sour dough bread and a side of fries. It was as amazing as I imagined! The mussels were so fresh and completely hit the spot! Will definitely come back next time I m in Vancouver.",

It became mildly busier and our food orders took a bit longer, which can be forgiven. The food and drink were excellent. Flatbread appetizer was great, never had anything like it before. The Vegetarian curry was very light and delicious according to my fellow diner (Not for my personal taste, however.) The large portion of lamb was incredibly tender, fell off the bone. Thought I have to admit, the giant bok-choy(?) in my dish was a bit odd, in my opinion. Leftovers were packed up for me. Will definitely go back in the future for Brunch!",

Foie gras (slight price upgrade) was paired with thick French toast, balsamic vinegar, and a cranberry (?) ice slush. It was a generous slice of foie gras and somewhat too much. I loved how the slush helped cleanse the palate between bites as it was very rich. Main: Venison meatball and gnocchi was great. The game meat was rich and gnocchi wasnt overly oily. The Arctic char was the highlight of the night. It was so tender and juicy with crisp seared skin, and the sides balance the flavors perfectly. One of the best fish dish Ive ever had! Dessert: lorange sanguine was a good assortment of desserts, with a variety of flavor and texture. Poire et chocolat was indulgent and the ganache was heavenly rich, however I dont agree with the pear pairing even though it was cooked well. Would come back next year for this menu again! Very well done.",

I got the Omelette w/ avocado and kombucha while he got the Paella w/ egg and drip coffee. For someone whos least favourite food is omelette, Im pleased to say that this was one of the most delightful omelettes Ive ever had. That is high praise. Entrees were both a little less than $20 dollars. The kombucha, however, will make you run the bill at $7. I hope that cultured bacteria helps me live longer for that price. Just get the coffee. What makes this place shine is its interior design. One of the best atmospheric dining experiences for that alone. Chambar normally specializes in dinner service, where the building takes on a whole new look, but features breakfast on the weekend. A safe bet if its your first date, and you want to win the lady over. Vegetarian options: I believe my omelette was vegetarian. Parking: EasyPark Lot 2 but the parking might run up the bill even further",

Nevertheless, the hostess was very friendly and nice and got us a table right away which was very much appreciated! We were blown how spacious and big with it being spread over two floors.  What a cool decor with the red bricks and aesthetics! We ordered the Paella and La Truite Fumee breakfast sandwich. Both dishes were flavourful and delectable ! I really enjoyed the paella with a fun twist as it had curried orzo instead of the Bomba rice. It was a such creative dish and very delicious! The service was great as well. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and took our dietary restrictions and allergies into consideration which is again much appreciated. The Belgian waffle was such a treat with the two sauces, chocolate lavender and the white pistachio chocolate sauce. We were very impressed at the food s quality, service and flavours. Totally recommend if you re wanting great brunch without waiting in line/queue for hours! Will return again",

The corn bread was delicious, the waffles perfect as usual, and the sausages were so good! We completely finished everything on our plates. The staff are very kind and understanding, as well as make you feel like a valued patron. Will definitely be coming in for dinner soon, too. I missed dining at Chambar.

            "review_text": "Had a fantastic experience here for my birthday. The food was absolutely amazing. Every bite was jam packed with flavour. The Le Boeuf dish was a great starter to start up your appetite. The candied morels in the dish were a great sweetness to go with the hanger steak. The mussels a la Congalise were a must have, I would definitely recommend getting their grilled sour dough to soak up the lovely soup. The Tajine lamb shank main was explosive with flavour. It was a wide medley of flavours, with quite a few sweet elements to it, but it was a great balanced dish. It was further improved with the harrisa and raita option which is absolutely necessary to the dish in my opinion. In regards to service the folks at the host stand they were very accommodating, as we had arrived for our reservation nearly 30 minutes too early. We were able to get seated right away which was fantastic. Although this was due to a table being available anyways. Our server Alicja was an absolute gem. She was very attentive and well versed in the menu. Her advice on portion sizing would have been well received if only the menu looked less appetizing. She recommended a glass of wine to go with my main dish which paired perfectly. A small speed bump to the whole experience was a small delay between our appetizers and mains. She amended the situation with free biscuits and chocolates at the end of the meal (biscuits and chocolate will fix just about any mistake or problem, but I am low maintenance). Overall the experience was great. Sure it was not picture perfect, but a mistake is no longer a mistake when it is corrected. I very much look forward to coming here in the future. And I would recommend it to everyone else in the city as well.",

The pork breakfast plate was very tasty, especially the sausage with the perfect hit of spice and flavor. The coffee was fantastic. And a waffle with salted caramel sauce was the perfect way to finish our meal. Service was top notch as well. Two thumbs up from both of us!",

Drinks were very nice too right level of strength and taste! Service was great too. I m glad that they strictly check vaccine cards and IDs at the door. My only displeasure was that for reservations they require a credit card guarantee. I understand it but it s very different from the industry practice.",

The ambiance is really cool with lots of wood and natural light. Spacing was great; didn t feel squished despite being quite busy. Check out the light fixtures; really unique.

I like how the menu is digital and separated into categories. Makes it easier for those dining in only for food, or only for drinks. We got the Paella and the La Saucisse. For the Paella, it was a different style of paella that Im normally used to. The rice they use was a bit different from other Paella Ive had. But overall it was good. The cornbread in the other dish was fantastic. I truly enjoyed it. The waffles was pretty standard from other places. For the ambience of the restaurant, its fairly upscale and has a fancy bar. Would be a good location for a drink and have a nice meal. Shoutout to their staff Kaya. She was very friendly and accommodating since we needed to rush out to catch a flight. Overall I will recommend for you to visit this restaurant for your brunch,  dinner or drink destination.",

Noticed they had an excellent beer list so decided to come back later in the day to sample it....absolutely sublime! Staff are great, venue is incredible and the person doing the interior design deserves an award. Ill be back!",

They offer mimosas and other cocktails as well as juice and coffee. We had the granola, fruit and yoghurt, the cassoulet and a few ordered waffles. Just be aware the waffles are somewhat small so if you are hungry you may want to order 2. The cassoulet was a wonderful mix of black eyed beans, fried egg, kale, sausage, chicken and chimichurri. It was very flavorful and light. The food came out in a timely manner and our server was very attentive.",

Lovely atmosphere, excellent service, beautiful design, amazing food, very generous portions, wide choices and so much more! I choose to take my best girlfriends there for her birthday diner because of the great reviews and we simply end up being stunned with the quality of the service! We had so much fun everything was excellent we ate so much until we didnt had place for desert anymore but still since the chef knew that we having a birthday dinner he made sure we get a small complimentary sweets with a happy birthday note. We were so happy with this beautiful treat!!! Everything was excellent but the mussels were exceptional definitely it is a must try!!! I recommend and recommend and recommend again!!! It is already my favourite place in downtown Vancouver and cant wait to go soon for brunch it looks like it is soo yummy!!!",
