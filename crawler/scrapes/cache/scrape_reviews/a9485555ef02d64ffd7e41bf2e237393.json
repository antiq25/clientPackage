I guess I cant complain about prompt service, but could have used more time to digest before the next dish came out. Dishes are served family style, so everyone had the opportunity to taste everything. Delicious food. Would definitely come again.",

They have an amazing happy hour and a great menu - it s hard to choose between so many of their wonderful dishes. Lovely, helpful, and kind staff. Love coming here again and again! Favorites include beet salad and fried chicken. This was my first time getting their pizza and it was 10/10!",

My group and I were seated upstairs, with a view of the kitchen, chefs and all the yummy dishes being prepared. The fried chicken and hot honey pizza were a stand out for me. The gin cocktail will knock even the most gin enthusiast off of their feet though, so beware! Espresso martini was good as well as their other fruity little cocktails. Dessert was good, but then again, when isn t it ;)",

            "review_text": "We had a nice lunch with the Brussels sprouts, shisho peppers, fried chicken, pepperoni pizza, kids tomato spaghetti, clam spaghetti, pot de creme, earl grey cake. Everything was delicious. The Brussels sprouts was amazing a nice Asian vinegary flavour like dumpling sauce. The pizza was soft and light, slightly spicy pepperoni. Clam spaghetti was excellent with clam garlic butter flavoured sauce. Drank all the sauce. Kid s spaghetti tasted the same quality as the rest of the meal. My 3.5 year old finished the whole plate. Pot de creme was very creamy and very sweet but delicious and smooth if you like very sweet flavours. The earl grey cake was soft and moist. Definitely recommend as it has a very good balance of sweetness and flavours. Service was solid. A few different people came to serve the table aside from our main server. They gave us enough service without being overwhelming. Kid-friendliness: Kids menu with adult quality recipes, colouring page with crayons. Let my 3.5 year old choose the colouring page from 2 options.",

We ordered the fried chicken, mushroom pizza, brussels sprouts, the earl grey cake dessert, and some mocktails. We were blown away by every single menu item we tried! The vibe/atmosphere was laid back yet classy. We even made another reservation so we could return before our trip was over. Love this restaurant and may buy the chef s cookbook because the creativity of the dishes was what set them apart.",

If your budget can t stretch to the famous (and very expensive) Hawksworth Restaurant, then try it s sister restaurant Nightingale- it s the run by the same chef, but it s much easier on the wallet! It s a great space, and very lively too. Service was superb throughout the night and nothing was missed. The food was incredible; the buratta salad was divine, mushroom pesto pizza was heavenly, but the clam spaghetti pasta was sensational! And dessert was amazing too - the carrot cake & the salted caramel creme. Yum. Fantastic meal, and one of the highlights of our 5 day visit. It s definitely worth booking in advance.",

            "review_text": "We walked in for an early dinner on Saturday and were immediately seated at a table overlooking the wood fired over upstairs. We were warmly greeted by our wonderful waiter (I regret not taking note of his name, but he mentioned he is from Columbia). The restaurant is lovely, with many different seating areas, all decorated tastefully without being pretentious. We were able to take advantage of the Happy Hour menu, which was full of cocktails and many food choices at a discount compared to the regular menu. The cocktails were beautifully prepared and very tasty. We proceeded to order the following: 1) Beets with whipped feta and dill -- fresh, lively and an outstanding opening to the meal. 2) Fried chicken -- a perfect portion for our family of four. Crispy and flavorful with a drizzle of maple syrup and topped with a pickle slice. This was the star of the meal. 3) Ketchup dusted fries with a delicious aoili -- delivered crisp and hot and perfectly spiced. 4) Blistered shishito peppers on a pool of tasty sauce -- beautifully prepared and a bountiful portion 5) Rigatoni Arrabiatta with a dollop of whipped ricotta. Spicy and cooked to perfection 6) Pizza with guanciale, pineapple and habanero. The perfect combination of spicy, salty and sweet. The dough of this neapolitan style pizza was delicious and had a great charred flavour and texture. 7) Pepperoni pizza -- delicious curled cups of pepperoni and just the right amount of onion. Pizza perfection. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Nightingale, made even better by the great server and rest of the staff, who made sure our glasses were always full and stomachs never empty. Vegetarian options: Salads on the menu and meat-free pizzas and pastas Kid-friendliness: Something for everyone in the family as a reasonable price",

Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) also divine! Parmesan Fries, dip was an unexpected flavor profile that matched very well (warning a little salty for the heart), Baked Sweet Potato - fully loaded and a great mix of sweet and sour.",

But that usually works only for starters. In Nightingale, even the bigger portions, such as octopus or pork chop, come cut. So you actually can put them in the middle an share them without trouble. The cocktails were fun too. Double Oaked Old Fashioned lasted me through the evening. We were quite full, but decided to try just one dessert. Chocolate ganache was another nice surprise: theres chocolate, but there are also spices, and lemon sourness, and banana at the bottom.",

I love overseas, and the planning process was organized really well back and forth on email. The food was all shared, including salads, entrees (chicken, pizzas) and the mains were grilled trout or chicken. We had so much food I wish I could ve packed some up but we had an after party! The venue has a great atmosphere and although the private space doesn t have a closed off room, it s far from other diners and tucked in by the kitchen. Our servers were excellent too (shoutout to Gabriella and Riley!)",

Cala, was super lovely, helpful in pointing food allergens in the menu. The sweet potato and the goat cheese salad were our favorites. Definitely worth going to at happy hour which we didn t intend.

We were seated at the best seats, and our server Anna was so friendly and recommended all the different dishes to us and what we should order. We ended up choosing 5 dishes, and honestly, I cant decide which one is my favorite because theyre all so good. Again, our server Anna is extremely friendly and she kept checking on us to make sure were okay, and Im so grateful for that because we sat quite far from other people. All the food was amazing, service was excellent, ambience was spot on, and overall experience was awesome. Ill make sure to come back more often!",

Our waitress ANNA is nice, helpful and very warm-hearted. We are impressed by her sense of humor also. The food is authentic as usual.  The pork cheek was very tender and tasty. However for people never tried Korean style fried chicken before, the buttermilk fried chicken will be fantastic. Otherwise I would save some stomach for the dessert. Lots of guests ordered their famous pizza, but we have only two persons so may leave for the next time.  And the reason we re glad to have lunch instead of dinner there, we still full after 5 hours.   Thank you Anna again. Glad to have you served us and we were pretty enjoy our talk.",

We had two drinks apiece and shared four dishes, and the final bill was surprisingly reasonable. Service was great, and the restaurant has a nice, busy atmosphere.",

            "review_text": "Nightingale is a modern trendy chef-driven establishment, eclectic clientele, with a classy staff. The staff engaged us in off-topic conversation and the whole experience left us with a great taste in our mouths for the rest of the evening.  Heres whats cool: The beet salad was exactly what you would expect, but  they sprinkled everything toping across the top, giving us a surprise crunchy savory onion/garlic/poppyseed experience. The baked sweet potato was exactly what you would expect, but... The salty taste of bacon was amplified by a subtle spice and Canadian sweetness. The morel mushroom risotto was somehow bright and flavorful even though risotto,  mushrooms, and asparagus are typically not. As a qualified rib expert (meaning I own a Traeger gill) who has traveled to South Carolina, Texas, and lived in Kansas City for 18 years, the ribs here blew my mind. I sincerely hope that everyone in the world gets to sit down with 18 yrs JP Wiser Canadian Whisky and enjoy these ribs: the meat had pull not tug, the fat was flavorful not greasy, and the sauce seemed homemade with traditional brown sugar, paprika, reduced tomatoes, and vinegar reduced down to a dry caramelization... but there was a good cumin flavor and something that appeared to us as lightly floral.",

First, I love family style sharing plates and second I dont think Ive eaten something here that I didnt like. The atmosphere is perfect for a date night, client lunch meeting or even a happy hour spot. Ive even taken my daughter here and brought some toys to keep her occupied. The brussel sprouts arent heavy and have a nice char. The beet salad is my favorite beet salad in Vancouver. Flavorful, creamy sauce and not too tart. The fried chicken is amazing with pickles and a slight hint of honey and not overly spicy seasoning. Every pizza Ive tried at Nightingale is amazing. Perfect Neapolitan pizza. I love their Margarita, but honestly they are all delicious. Salmon entree was likely sou vide which locked in all the juices and was so soft. Their seasonal item was the butternut squash tortellini and we almost had to order another dish. Service is amazing and Im never disappointed.",

The watermelon salad was delicious and interesting to begin with but I found it better as a cleanse between all the other foods we were eating. The fried chicken was okay, the spiced maple syrup tasted like chutney on the chicken so I didn t find it as good as other reviews have mentioned. The halibut ceviche was amazing, nice acidity balanced with the chip. It was a hit between the both of us. The steak and pork were delicious, it was very well prepared! Lastly the deserts were lovely! The lemon semolina cake was very nice as I enjoy more tart and sour flavours. The sweet basil yogurt ice cream was the star of that desert for sure. The ice cream sandwich was good, but the ice cream was a bit too hard to enjoy straight away but I understand it would be hard to have a clean cut of ice cream between two cookies if it wasn t. Overall the food came out fast, the atmosphere was nice and the server and staff were all kind and made the night enjoyable! Highly recommend!",

            "review_text": "My partner chose this place for a surprise birthday meal for myself. We were sat at the chef s table, which if you re sat in that section don t be disheartened. It s fantastic. The service was superb, wine selection was impossible to select a wrong glass or bottle.   The kitchen was organized,  and impeccably maintained. The expo chef even ran dishes if he had the time. As two people who ve worked in the service industry for over a decade, it s hard to be so impressed by a place like we were at the Nightingale. My sincere hats off to the entire team who work so hard to make their environment as warm and welcoming as it was. We will be back! Vegetarian options: So many flavourful options! My partner is vegetarian so I ate more vegetarian dishes than I normally would. We had the marinated beet salad with citrus and whipped ricotta. It was fantastic. My partner who does not enjoy beets loved it. They were marinated to take the dirty taste away but still left that classic earthiness. Dietary restrictions: Although no modifications are allowed on dishes, they are allergen safe and knowledgeable on which dishes you may have.",

Dish 3 cavatelli bolognese perfectly al dente more like al dente to perfection no more like perfectly perfect and nice sauce with a kick. Then if your sweet sauce drizzle from the chicken melds with the heat from the bolognese you have it folks throw that fork down! Bahaha couldn t stop saying yum throughout the meal and wouldn t let the servers take away my plates with leftover sauce cuz I just wasn t done til the last drop. Not only that they have a kids menu!!!! My vegetarian toddler is going to eat up that kids menu chicken sans sauce like it s ice cream! And the service is impeccable friendly, courteous, relaxing, attentive in a subtle manner, even the host had us smiling and laughing before we got to the table.

All our dishes were fantastic and the service was excellent! The only very minor knock was that it was slightly loud (and would have given 4.5 stars on atmosphere but half-stars was not an option). We had a wonderful meal and definitely want to return again! I would highly recommend this place.",

I was not able to make dinner reservations ( need to make far in advance), so appetizers and cocktails it was. We had the  Paper Plane  and  Bramble  cocktails which were amazing (especially loved the paper plane ) , and for appetizers enjoyed the Buttermilk fried chicken and warm marinated , spiced olives. I am not kidding when I say it was by far the best fried chicken we have ever had. I would love to know how they were able to cook it so light and not greasy   every detail of the recipe was perfect contributing to the flavour of the dish including the slice of pickle. I can t wait to go back and try some of the other cocktails on their list as well as different dishes. Lovely staff, location, and decor as well!",

Best brussel sprouts I ve ever had and one of the highlights of the night. We then had the Braised Meatballs, which i just found okay, tasted like any other meatball, but my partner loved them. Then for my entree, I had the Arctic Char, which was great. I ve never had that fish before, so I would say it s like salmon. My boyfriend had the braised pork cheek which he says was great as well. Lastly, we had the Banoffee Cake and that was to die for. I would come back just for that alone - absolutely mouthwatering and delicious. This was all worth every pretty penny. I would love to come back to try some of the things we missed. Again, wow!",

Theres lots on the menu to try... meant to share as some of the meat dishes would be too heavy for one person to have all in one sitting. I think the menu changes seasonally if I heard correctly so will def comeback and try some other items we didn t get to try this time around. Highly recommend",
