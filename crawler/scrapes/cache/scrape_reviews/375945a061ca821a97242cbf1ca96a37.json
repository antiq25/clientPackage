            "review_text": "This small little gem was the perfect spot for a Vegan/ Carnivore duo to dine together.  I had the cornbread with pulled pork and it was so delicious.  The bread was just the right amount of crisp and crunch around the edges, moist and full of flavor.  The presentation of the food was too pretty to not capture the memory and everything else about the meal and drinks was above average.  Even their grapefruit juice was better than I ve had and noteworthy! Having our server interact with us throughout the entire meal added to the fun.  He even sat with us for a few minutes for conversation as he cheered us on to try our first ever pickle back. Great experience and a shout out to our camera shy server that we would ask for by name if only I could remember it!",

It was a very hot day and we chose to sit inside because their outdoor area is in the back and smelled very strongly of garbage. The inside doesnt have AC so it was prettttyyyyy slick inside too. They have some cool rolling windows which they opened and that helped a bit. The food and service way outweighed the issues with the location. Highly reccomend!",

Even the local craft beer purveyors are charging $9for these same beers??? Then, the bbq menu is so deeeelish and i had a dandy pull pork sammy for $14 bucks with salad... Seriously!?? So many F&B places have lost perspective on value. The heat level was kept warm so you actually feel you can stay before hypothermia sets in. Music is very conducive, the renos are very character oriented. Cozy, very good food, no price gouging... A definite go there!!! (one red flag, give it a rest on 18% tips appearing, its a gawdamn recession, your service is the same, my wallet is thinner, pay your staff better, its not my cross tk bear!!",

Those hot links are seriously great though, I have to stress that. My partner is celiac and we were thrilled to learn that the vast majority of the menu is gluten free! We had fair amount of leftovers, which were just as tasty the next day. The redone bar looks great, its larger but makes better use of the space. Its warm, woody, and has bourbon.
