The fish burger was so fresh and tasty, fries are home made and not salty, chicken wrap is full of flavor with lots of veggie and the hummus is seriously the best Ive had. Highly recommend and will definitely come back to try more food. I dont like food that is too salty and the food here is just right!",

I ordered lunch today - the online order process was easy and straightforward. The food was ready according to the time displayed on the website. And the food was EXCELLENT! I had the chicken sandwich with medium spice and coleslaw, with a side of fries and tartar sauce. The bun, chicken, and coleslaw were amazing. The fries  outstanding! I think they season them with paprika. I hope that everyone tries this place out because it s great. I moved back to Vancouver in the spring and I d say that this is the best meal I ve had. Edit: 9 hours later Lunch was so good that I got take-out for dinner. My wife ordered the Chicken Feast and I had the beef street wrap. LIKE WOAH. Everything was amazing, and the prices suspiciously low :) There were only two staff behind the counter on a busy Saturday night so I felt bad for them,  but they were keeping up and the quality of the food is top notch. Also, the cheesecake is sublime.",

            "review_text": "Chefhyve is the hidden gem that nobody knows about. Hidden on the corner of Slocan and Kingsway, chefhyve offers a variety of fresh menu items which include vegetarian options. The french fries are, hands down, the best french fries in the city.  They remind me of french fries back home in Montreal. The fish burger is so fresh, it quite literally disintegrates into heaven in your mouth.  And just when you think it cant get any better, the wraps are fully loaded with fresh, homemade ingredients, including the wide selection of homemade sauces. I recommend the spicy garlic. If you have a sweet tooth, the make your own ice cream bar lets you create an ice cream bar like no other.  From skor pieces to edible flowers.  Highly instagram-able and equally delicious. To top it all off, I always have a positive experience with the friendly staff.  I had the pleasure of being served by Alex and Daria tonight which prompted me to write this review. Chefhyve makes you feel like you are visiting friends as opposed to just being a client in a restaurant. If you havent tried Chefhyve yet, you are missing out on something special and local in Vancouver.",

We got the double smashed burger, coleslaw, and Cajun chicken plate. Burger was very good, especially liked the sauce. Didn t have the super crispy edges, but was also less greasy. Cheese could ve been melted a bit more, but small nitpicks. Coleslaw was surprisingly my favourite. It was very light and balanced. Slightly tangy, peppery, and just a very nice flavour that was easy to devour. Cajun chicken bowl was alright. It was healthy, and tasted healthy. Nothing too special, thought it could ve used a tad bit more S+P, but personal preference. I m a bit surprised the sun dried tomatoes weren t sliced, as they just put them into the bowl whole. Since they weren t cut, it made them chewier and hard to enjoy as they overpowered every bite. My feedback would be to omit the sun dried tomatoes unless more prep is going into them, as they just detracted from the dish. Overall, everything was delicious and will be back.",

It was made fresh when I ordered it - freshly battered in a light coating with their special seasoning and fried. It s nice to be able to enjoy a Fish Sandwich without any worries of cross contamination or having any Haram ingredients to worry about. Also got some of their falafels with crispy pita chips to start with their hummus. They make all their sauces, hummus, coleslaw, salsa in house from fresh high quality ingredients. Also their fries are hand cut in store daily. FYI their Halal Meat supplier is Mediterranean Halal Meats in Vancouver.",

This hole in the wall is not your fast food healthy bowl or typical middle eastern grill. I made the mistake of thinking that as I passed by numerous times and did not go in. I only realized when I saw the chef took out the fresh ingredients and started preparing everything from the beginning in the open kitchen. At first, I was impatient, but then I saw how much care and pride he put in the cooking, and I knew it would be worth it. The pictures cannot capture it because things like hummus and falafel looks similar but taste worlds apart. This may arguably be the best in the city. Even the spicy garlic and tartar sauce was house made and they were so good I kept these for my next meals.",

Its one of the best places to eat in the city, and they dont skimp on portion sizes either. What makes Chefhyve truly exceptional is the remarkable flavors they bring to the table. The food is nothing short of delicious, and each bite is a delightful adventure for your taste buds. I have absolutely no hesitation in giving Chefhyve my full recommendation. Its a must-visit spot for anyone looking to savor outstanding food in Vancouver.",

Growing up, my dad had a fish and chip restaurant so I am very picky about these things. This place completely exceeded my expectations. Plus the price was incredibly reasonable.

The Fish&Chips is not your typical English batter style food.  Not greasy and doughy tasting.  Very crisp and not oily at all batter/coating.  The fries are  fresh hand cut kennebec  chips  that are also very tasty and not oily tasting at all.  The dessert waffle was also nice and sweet. But not too sweet either that makes it very enjoyable.  I don t have photos of before eating except for the end results. (Sorry).  Ps .. Fish&Chips seem to be very popular dish as 5 ppl did takeout while we were eating there.",

It is more than evident that Ala takes great pride in his work, his team and their offerings. This level of food business may seem a little out of place, considering the surroundings, but that just adds to its charm. This menu has literally something for everyone and, no matter what you order, you will not be disappointed. Top props to Ala and his team.

Ordered 1pc fish and fries, double cheeseburger and crunchy garlic chicken wrap. The fish wasn t as crunchy by the time it got here but it definitely wasn t soggy and was still so delicious, can t imagine what it would be fresh. The wrap was delicious, it was different. So tasty. I love smash burgers but so far from where I am and this was as close to that. So delicious, my husband and I really enjoyed everything! Can t wait to order again or try it fresh!",

My wife had the In and Out inspired cheeseburger which was juicy and deliciously messy. Everyone there was genuinely passionate about the food they were serving and made us feel like regulars despite us visiting for the very first time. Cant wait to go back!",

There is a wait BECAUSE it is all made fresh. Fish and chips are not frozen so get them when they are available, chicken so fresh and juicy cant stop eating. The fries are from fresh potatoes, not frozen like the rest of the food, so quantity is limited get it or come back next time. The owner is also an absolute ray of sunshine. Hes kind, friendly, and wants to give the best product and service, and he suceeds! Your doing a fantastic job!",
