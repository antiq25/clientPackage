            "review_text": "There are a lot of options for Vietnamese food on Victoria Drive, but La Maison Da Nang is my go to. I am a big fan of their vermicelli bowls, and the fried spring rolls are amazing. I love that they do the crispy thick wrapper, whereas many restaurants do thinner wrap. I ordered a grilled chicken with spring roll vermicelli bowl for take out, however there was some miscommunication as when I got home I realized they gave me pork. Regardless, it was so good that I ended up dining in the next day. This time I successfuly got the grilled chicken and it was also delicious. Ive tried their pho in the past and it is a good standard bowl of pho. The restaurant is clean, feels new, and our server was attentive and nice. Will be ordering from here whenever I crave Vietnamese!",

We ordered the crepe/pancake (banh xeo da nang) , the shrimp-topped mini pancakes (banh khot), da nang udon (banh canh da nang), Vietnamese tapioca dumplings (banh bot loc la chuoi). My absolute favorites were the da nang udon (banh canh da nang) and tapioca dumplings (banh bot loc la chuoi). Those 2 items are definitely stand outs. The noodle broth was so tasty and umami and the noodles themselves were very delicious and wonderfully chewy but also tender. The tapioca dumplings were beautifully made and had a good amount of filling in them, the shrimp and meat inside were so yummy. I really like the food here and the zero pretentiousness. Definitely coming back and bringing my fam here.",

Came back here again and the food didn t disappoint. Everything was great and authentic. Updated on the 20th Aug. came back again and still as great as ever. Portions are still just as large.",

The Banh Canh dish was one of the better soups we have ever tried. Udon style noodles with a rich broth, shrimp and pork and great presentation. Really, really good. Fish cakes in the Bun Cha Ca were really good, tasted really fresh.  Spring rolls were amazing too. The best we have had since Thien Trang on Nanaimo closed down. Service was efficient and took all the steps for covid safety. We will be back to try some of the other dishes. Highly recommend.",

Never heard or tried  #37 Banh Hoi ($13.95) it was similar to Bun Cha from Hanoi. Long menu got my overwhelmed at first since I love BanhMi, Pho and Bun Cha and almost everything looked good. Waitress helped me answering my question on  BanhHoi and the Bun Cha(dipped noodle with meat and spring roll) on the menu. She was very informative and friendly. #37 is a popular dish from DaNang according to what she said. This dish was quite impressive it came with variety of leafy veggies and meats. Meats were fresh and tender. Im not sure if beef was in it, but skewered pork was tender and yummy. It also had chargrilled BBQ flavour. Shrimp with sugarcane was pretty good just that sugarcane was hard to eat. I nibbled a bite to squeeze the sugarcane juice. My dish was hearty and refreshing overall. Perfect summer dish I would say! It also felt like Vietnamese style of lettuce wrap with noodles and meat. I want to try different dishes next time; thank you, LMDN! I left the restaurant feeling full that day.",

But Im on a hunt for banh canh (crab meat udon / rice noodles) so hell, Ill bite. And boy am I glad I did. Food: Ive tried the banh canh (obviously) and 2 of their appetizer dishes so far and theyre all delish, taste very close to what I had back in Vietnam so you know the authenticity is no joke. I must admit their customer service is not the best, waiters dont go around and annoy you with is everything okay every 2 minutes like other places, you have to make efforts to even grasp their attention. But I think this could be improved overtime or when it get busier. Tldr: excellent food, meh customer service but I see theyre reading the reviews and are trying so 2 extra stars for the effort. Also, they accept all kinds of cards, credits, debits, amex, you name it for payment which is a big plus since most of the places in the neighborhood are cash only or just debits.",

We ended up ordering the pho house special, 2 banh mi, and the banh xeo. The pho soup was tasty and the beef nice and soft, and the banh mi had tones of delicious lemongrass chicken and vegetables. The banh xeo was my favorite!! The yellow rice pancake part was wonderfully crispy, while the inside had lots of pork and shrimp. Then when its wrapped in lettuce and herbs and dipped in the sauce it becomes almost magical- the sour from the sauce, the sweet and almost spicy zap of the herbs, and of course the crunch and savoriness of the pancake itself- you just need to try it :) unfortunately we didnt take any photos because we were too hungry, but we will for next time!!",
