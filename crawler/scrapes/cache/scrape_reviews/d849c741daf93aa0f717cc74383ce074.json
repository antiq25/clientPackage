We ordered a Greek feta salad, pork souvlaki, lamb souvlaki skewers and the platter for 2 in which we got chicken skewers, pork skewers and tiger shrimp. I highly recommend checking this place out as it has many options and it s located in a great area. Will surely be back to try the other options.",

As you enter the place , you can feel the warmth with the smell of good food. We went there for lunch and although the lunch menu is a 1 pager, it has all the favourites from souvlaki to gyros and just apps including pita and dip. I had the lamb youvetsi, and this lamb just falls off the bone. The orzo and tomato soup just pop and adds a great warmth to the food. Being served in mini banbarries are great, even though you would think they warm, but they are not. The food inside is though.",

From the greeting, the seating, and the kindness that stemmed from our server and bartender was unmatched. The knowledge of product, mixed with the fun candor created  not only a safe place to share a meal and healthy conversation but a place I would feel confident recommending to friends and family. Not only did I feel like a long standing regular, but someone whose needs were met. Bartending for over 10 years and after a really hard day I required a tequila shot. The lime topping the gateway to my relaxation was trimmed perfectly and was presented with a vibrant green which celebrated my order. This may seem small, but the care taken in protecting fresh garnishes was represented proudly. Hats off to my two new friends, Rayanne, and Lane. Incredible experience. You made my dim day too bright for even sunglasses.",

Their menu is fresh, tasty, and healthy, staying true to its Greek origins, but with lots of modern twists. Happy hour on the patio is one of the best ways to spend a couple of hours people watching and enjoying their drinks menu. The staff at the Greek are the secret sauce that makes it special. From Skerdi, the friendliest manager around, to great servers like Amanda and Adam, youre always made to feel welcomed. Highly recommended.",
