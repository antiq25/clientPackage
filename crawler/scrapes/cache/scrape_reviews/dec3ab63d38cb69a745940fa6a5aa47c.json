            "review_text": "Just had an Oreo McFlurry from here. Pretty good! Have you seen the prices of Dairy Queen blizzards lately? Its outrageous! You can make a decent argument in the difference of size between a regular McFlurry and a medium blizzard, bit of a battle right? But pound for pound and buck for buck, youre going to want to go for the Oreo McFlurry over the Oreo Blizzard, especially because I went around 10:45pm. Dairy Queen closes at like 9:00pm. Crazy! Everybody knows soft serve cream hits different post 10:00pm. This McDonalds experience has brought me happiness and they have gained a loyal customer over their opponent. Cheers.",

I have talked to you multiple times due to very bad management that I faced in your store, but today I wanted to congratulate you with hiring -Pegah-. What amazing customer service she provided to me today. Honestly, this was the best level of service I have ever received in any fast food. I can tell the level of customer service was in a level of a high end luxury dine in restaurants. There was a big mistake that happened at the drive thru by one of your employees and after I got to the payment window, I saw -Pegah- already there to make sure there is nothing to get mistaken, she actively listened and apologized to me for the mistake without me even get upset, so at the point that I found that I have been taken care of to get  the right food, I was even thinking about time, mistakes and getting angry. It was an amazing feeling I have received when I got taken care of not only for the money that I paid extra and the wrong sandwich, but she kindly provided me with free apple pie and asked me to keep the wrong sandwiches even though I didnt order them. As a long term manager in retail, I want to thank you (Mina) for getting amazing people like -Pegah- hired in your team and thank -Pegah- for her amazing service. I want to let you know that I just bought my items less than half an hour ago, but I found it will be so unfair to not mention this to everyone with this level of customer service. Thank you so much.",
