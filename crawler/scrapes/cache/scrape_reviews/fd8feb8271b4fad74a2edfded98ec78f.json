            "review_text": "I have never had so many problems with a pharmacy before. I have used this pharmacy for years but in the last year have had nothing but problems getting my prescriptions and my sons prescriptions billed to our medical carrier and they have given me different excuses everytime. Started by saying that they tried billing it and they were unable to get the coverage ( checked with my carrier and superstore never even attempted) and the last time I tried superstore told my that my coverage was denied and I was no longer covered by the provider. So I instantly went into stress mode, turns out that was a lie. I know manually entering in your prescription details and getting the refund a week or two later isnt the biggest problem but it is still very annoying being lied to and told a number of different reasons why they do not do direct billing. Will be going anywhere else to have prescriptions filled in the future.",
