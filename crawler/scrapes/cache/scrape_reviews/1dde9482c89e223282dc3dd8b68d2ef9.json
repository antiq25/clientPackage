She was so patient with me and gave me awesome drink recommendations.  I ended up with a cider and did try the IPAs. The soup and salad were fresh and delicious.  I believe it was a chicken curry soup. I then ordered the Poutine with bacon and mushrooms. Very tasty! I loved how the place was right across the Gastown steam clock. So I was able to hear the steam go off while enjoying my meal and the view. If I ever come back to Vancouver, I will go out of my way to eat here again!",

            "review_text": "While visiting Vancouver in 2018, we stopped at the corner of Water Street & Cambie and the Gastown Steam Clock. After taking some of the usual tourist photos & waiting for the steam to blow the whistle, we found our way to the Black Frog Eatery. Settling in at 1 pm we were warmly welcomed and quickly seated. From our table we had an excellent view of the Steam Clock. I watched tourists posing with the clock as we awaited our order. We weren t very hungry and decided to share a club sandwich.  I m happy to say that it was made with real meat none of that sliced processed poultry!  The fries were good too, and I washed it all down with a local award-winning Kokanee lager. The ambiance of the Black Frog is definitely that of a pub-style eatery and the decor accentuates that feel.  That s a good thing, and to me, very comforting. Lot s of wood, brick, and pub-style elements all around. This is absolutely the type of place I d have lunch at if I d worked in the area.  Their menu has a good selection to satisfy everyone s tastes. Prices are on par with other restaurants offering similar fare.  The type of place that I call  no nonsense and basic good eating . Service was prompt, efficient, and the staff knew their menu well. When we find our way back to Vancouver, I will certainly plan on coming back.",

Thanks to the owner and the great staff (Nemo, Sally and Taylor) for making me feel welcome from the start.

As the only Oilers bar in Vancouver they serve as a much needed refuge for us Oilers fan in a sea of Canucks. They are friendly and do their best to keep their Oilers atmosphere (if the Oilers are playing and you don t watch hockey it s best to avoid it). They have a decent menu, beer lineup, and they re a stone throw from the steam clock in the waterfront. Give them the work if you re an Oilers fan or if you re just a fan of a good pub in a the waterfront area. They ll take care of you. And personally a good old tip of the hat from me to them, for making a home sick Edmonton boy feel at home. Cheers to you guys, thanks for everything see you next season.",

The Black Frog is located near the water, just past that silly Steam Clock (which you will hear frequent patrons groan about as it rings at the top of every hour! ). The Black Frog offers amazing in-house specials including, an Edmonton street food favorite, green onion cakes! The last time I went, I ordered the Pork schnitzel burger, and was raving about it for a week! Everytime Ive gone, there has never been a wait time for a spot to sit. The menu prices are very reasonable (nothing higher than 30$), drink menu is solid and changes from time to time (they have very good specials depending on when you go), and the service is very friendly and attentive. They play sports on the televisions and hang regalia of national, and international soccer teams on their walls, in the form of warm scarves! This pub truly is a little slice of Edmonton in the bustling Vancouver downtown. Feel free to strike up conversation, or try your hand at beating the pinball machine in the corner (I hear they love new names on the leaderboard!)",
