The prawns were enormous and perfectly cooked. Every flavour was balanced and expertly executed. I will be coming here more often for sure to try the rest of the menu. I had no clue International Village had so many good options in the food court. The only advice I give is go easy on the spice. I ordered Medium spice with my noodles and, though I could handle it, I m at the age where the rest of my body is not too keen of a certain threshold of chillies onwards. I will be paying for this level of spice later. But for now, HOT DANG was it delicious.",

I was looking for a place to eat and the reviews from previous customers had all indicated two things: you should not miss this when your in the area and that the food is authentic as it is in Thailand. I couldn t pass and I agree with the previous customers and enjoyed the service and the food itself. The gentlemen at the cashier was very friendly by greeting me in Thai - it s appreciated. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was delicious. It had the perfect spice to it and the spring roll was just right. I loved the soup that came with it as it washed down the after taste. Next time I will try their soup and I will come by soon! Thank you for the experience today :)",

            "review_text": "Sometimes you find the best food in the most unexpected places. Walking into International Village Mall for the first time, you might be taken aback by how empty and dead it feels, especially in contrast to the surrounding lively Gastown district. But you d be surprised by how alive the food scene is. Especially this little hidden gem. We had: Pad Thai Combo ($14.99 + $2 for choosing prawns) - one of the best Ive had, the flavour was a perfect balance of slightly sweet, savoury and a little kick of spice (you can adjust). The combo comes with the following: (1) a salad, (2) a spring roll, (3) a soup, and (4) your choice of a drink. The soup was clean and clear but packed with flavour. It was a clear sign that the chef is talented Tom Kah Goong (Prawn) ($14.95) - this is very reminiscent of the more popular Tom Yum soup but with the addition of creamy coconut milk. It was piping hot (seriously, be careful!) but I fought through the pain to gulp it down because it was so delicious! Those hot, sour, creamy flavours all melded together into an amazing concoction. Bites of mushroom, lemongrass, tomatoes, onions, and prawns throughout were delightful The fact that you re getting this level of restaurant-quality (and honestly much better than some restaurants) food in a little place like this is unbelievable. Theyre the sweetest and they obviously pour so much love into what they do. If you re ever in the area, I hope you ll consider stopping by this hidden food court! While its exterior may not seem particularly extraordinary, it holds some amazing flavours and wonderful people.",

Ive tried so many of their dishes, and theyre all great. Some of my favourites are the Pad See Ew, spring roll, eggplant stir fry, and curries. You pick your protein or vegetable/tofu and level of spice. Ive had no problem asking for vegetarian options, in fact when I do, Sam asks if egg is okay- yes, he goes the extra mile to make sure your food is how you like it!  Tasty food, good portions. Hot Tip: They dont hold back on spice. I like spicy and I usually ask for mild. My partner usually asks for no spice. Vegetarian options: They have tofu or vegetable only versions of most of their dishes. I usually ask for no fish sauce, egg okay, and theyre always on point. Although, Im not sure if they even use fish sauce... I just always ask to be sure.",

Dishes are fully customizable and the proprietors are the nicest people who always bring a smile. A great place to grab a spicy bite before a movie or event at Rogers Arena!",

Kid-friendliness: So kind to my daughter and always giving her snacks while we wait. Keeps her occupied. She now loves to greet him and show him whatever she s wearing and loves babbling at him.

In the food court of The International Village Mall, a cute couple runs it. They are very appreciative for your business and have great customer service. Unlike other food court eateries, she made our food to order. I ordered a veggie stir-fry and asked her to make it spicy for my boyfriend and she offered to include a spicy chili oil for him in case he needed more spice. I ordered a tofu red curry and it was delicious. Both orders came out hot and fresh from the kitchen. This place was way above what we expected!

Staff told me Wow Thai is gone and the owner went back to Thailand. Anyways, the lunch combo sounded appetizing which really was. Pad Thai Combo ($14.99) was impressive. Pad Thai was freshly made it was yummy. Spring roll tasted okay, but salad and soup were pretty good. Food was quite flavourful overall. Ill become very indecisive about my lunch since Bali Thai (next door) is good as well. Little Bangkok Thai is pretty good; itll take me back to memories of my Thailand trips.",

My only complaint is that sometimes they take a really really long time to give you your food (40 minutes last time I went) or sometimes as little wait as 10 minutes, so its kind of inconsistent.
