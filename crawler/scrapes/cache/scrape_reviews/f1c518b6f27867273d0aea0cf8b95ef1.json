It was around 10pm and they rushed us to order food and drinks. Only good thing was our server. Guy worked really hard and he was the only one on the floor. We ordered rose lassi and margrita. Drinks were great but obviously it took some time to arrive on our table since there was only one guy to do all the tasks. Five stars only for him and i dont want to affect your restaurant ratings. I didnt get a chance to catch his name but if you are reading this.. you are doing a great job. U saved 4 stars for your restaurant otherwise i would have given only one star for food.",

Huge variety of Indian food and few Chinese food as well. CAD 26 with Tax and you can eat as you wish from the buffet. Lovely to see how the staff refills the buffet with closely paying attention.

The made to order is probably even better but I tasted the buffet. Huge selection including fresh salad bar which is always great. Literally 40 - 60 dishes so you can have a taste of many. Happy hour 3-6 has wine at $5 and beer @ $4  Happy hour or not good value for your buck. Clean, plain atmosphere. Service was good. Outside patio if you want fresh air. Help the businesses on Broadway during this construction. The dinner will feel even better. Highly recommend.",

Usually people tend to mess up when the selection is this big but not this place. Each curry was finger licking good and tasted amazing. The only downside I felt was that the chicken felt slightly harder to chew probably coz it wasnt the freshest but the taste of the curry more than made up for it. The taste is genuine Indian and the staff is super polite and helpful. 10/10 will recommend.",

The flavor, the packaging, spice level, sizes of meat, longest grain basmati rice, actual chunks of ginger and spices - at 11pm at night on a snowy Monday - this place absolutely blew my socks off. What a pleasant surprise. What a dinner. This may well be the very best Biryani that is possible to make in Canada. It will cater to any taste bud. Nothing but best wishes and compliments to this place. Keep up the great work, highly recommended and will definitely come again.

EDIT 2: Updated to 5 stars because I cant help but love this place. Im going to start by saying that Im only leaving this a 3-star review to hopefully get the attention of management. Ill change the review to 5 stars in the near future. This place is amazing. The service is awesome, and the food was incredible. Note: was. I have been ordering from New India as my regular takeout place for at least a year now. I have been ordering the same thing every time: 2 lunchboxes, 1 veg, 1 non-veg. Every single week. Its gotten to the point where the staff recognizes me by name and knows my order. Like I said, great service. The value is incredible, and the food has been top-notch. My girlfriend (from India) has said that this is the best Chana Masala she has ever had in her life. Now to the reason for my review. They recently changed something, within the past month or so. New chef, new recipes, Im not really sure, but the taste has completely changed. The chana has much less flavour and tastes watery, the butter chicken tastes plain, and this goes for a lot of the curries that we were eating with the thali. Its truly a shame, because I loved the atmosphere and the service in this establishment, and I looked forward to the treat of Friday night takeout from New India. With this change Im not sure if Ill continue. Ive been actively looking for a new takeout spot, but what Id love most is for New India to return to their original flavors.",

FOOD: This is a buffet which is all-you-can-eat offering a nice selection of curry and side-dishes. There were plenty of vegetarian dishes as well, with around 50% of the choices in the back being suitable for vegetarians. There is only one choice of rice but other sides such as naan give a good variety of dips to accompany the curry. DRINK: Since I always gorge myself, Ive never ordered a lot of special drink such as the chai tea or mango beverage they offer but the cucumber water provided in the buffet is cool and refreshing after eating a lot of the spicy curry. INTERIOR: I am always tempted to take a nap inside because of the dim lighting and comfortable couches! This is definitely a place that is welcoming to sit for extended periods of time and I would definitely bring a dinner or lunch party here for impressing others. There are sports constantly playing on the TV, and the restaurant would do some special events during holidays or sporting events. SERVICE: Always friendly and attentive. If a food needs freshening up because its been sitting too long, someone runs out of water or plates need cleaning up, the staff come without anyone flagging them down. The restaurant is always tidy, a testament to how well they clean the place.",

I understand this could be due to them sitting in the warmer a bit longer. Best of all they have free parking in the core of the city!  I will definitely be back again!!

Same goes for the baked vegetables. They have steamed rice, pilaff/ polao, nun, chow mine etc carb and butter chicken, goat curry and tandoori chicken. You can make your own salad by picking different ingredients and dressings from the counter. As I was driving I did not drink, but believe they have almost everything needed in their bar. Important: they have free parking at their basement which you can access through the rear end of the building.

Also a large variety of dishes that would satisfy everyone. Also the curry dishes have lots of meat in them and not just all sauce that Ive had at other restaurants. The service isnt bad from my experience. Ive been seated promptly and water brought to the table right away. They as for drink orders right away. After that Im left to do my thing which I like and its never an issue to wave a server over if I need anything. I find everyone there very friendly and easy going. One of the cooks was putting some food out - she was like a grandmother and had a huge smile on her face. I thanked her so much for the wonderful food",

I would like to Thank Raghav our host/server made our experience a memorable one. After a long rough week we just wanted a warm and cozy meal and Raghav s service made us feel so comfortable. Loved his positive, kind and uplifting attitude. He always had a smile on his face checked up on us and got the most appetizing food straight to us without any delays. He also accommodated my dietary needs without any hesitation. Never ever have we got such an amazing service by a host at any restaurant. Thank you so much Raghav you made our night :) We really appreciate people who go an extra mile and put all their efforts to provide an unforgettable experience. Then i would like to jump onto the 2nd thing that this place is our spot from now onwards because of their DAL MAKHANI IT WAS MOUTHWATERING. Hats off to the chef who made it. When i took that one bite I had tears in my eyes. It was so rich and flavourful, I haven t had such good Dal Makhani in years literally IN YEARS. It was so good both me and my boyfriend were astonished by how good it was. So cozy so warm and so creamy  perfect comfort meal and they have the best butter naans too. Chef s kiss  Can t get over the fact that it was so delicious. Perfect blend of spices and the texture I have to say its a MUST TRY. I am so impressed by my dining experience that I had to write this long review. THE CHEF AND OUR SERVER DESERVES A RAISE  Truly a Luxurious experience :) would recommend 100%",

This restaurant had perfect buffet selections to my surprise. I eat a lot of this kind of food and have not felt as satisfied as I was with New India Buffet! I could have a little bit of everything I love most at reasonable cost. Spices and ingredients were on point. Friendly helpful staff. We are Vegan so I am very grateful for restaurants that label which selections are suitable for us. There were SO many options and it made our time there a breeze. Cool to see a little salad bar too. I was also pleased with how clean and fancy the atmosphere was inside. Also a great patio for those who wish to sit outdoors. Thanks NIB!   (yesterday was my husbands birthday and we were suppose to go to a different style restaurant but it had a long waiting list. Glad everything worked out the way it did because we got to go here for our first time). Now we dont want to waste time anywhere else!",

Great spread very tastefully made, deserts are a major let down though. Ambiance is amazing. Staff is thankfully smiley except for they are not trained to be at the edge. Basic thing like the moment you enter the restaurant someone from far will ask you to come in and sit. They somehow lacked polished hospitality. Later I also heard owners fighting in restaurant. That s was like super weird. Now all that being said I totally enjoyed eating here because food taste was great, thanks to the cook. Rest everything else I will rate 2star.",

Neat place and Ambiance  is really nice, does have enough sitting arrangement inside and outside. Thumps up for the place. If you are living or visiting in Vancouver, should visit once. Tried other places as well but this was a really good experience. On my next trip, I am coming again to this place..",

The buffet looked amazing, but we opted to get a few other dishes instead from the kitchen which was all very tasty. Samosa platter was amazing Chicken Pakora was very good Peshwari naan was very, very good.  Ive never had it before but I will choose this more often,  Was very nice. Staff was friendly, not too crowded.  The music they had in the restaurant was great as well.",
