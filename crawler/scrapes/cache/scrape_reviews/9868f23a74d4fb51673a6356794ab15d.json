My wife had the Steak Diane, the sauce is made with red wine and chanterelle.. she said the steak just melted in her mouth. We paired them both with local BC reds. The service was old school style, gracious and friendly. 5* dinner !",

            "review_text": "Had the pleasure to take advantage of the three course 2022 dine out lunch menu. For $25 per person (pp), we received a three course meal which started with a goat cheese salad appetizer (also had a choice of a chef selection soup   which was coconut chicken that day), a main   three options available salmon, short rib pasta and a vegetarian option which was a portobello mushroom burger   we selected the latter two. Both tasted great; albeit, the pasta was heavy as it was made with a cream sauce. We ended the meal with a slice of decadent chocolate cake. For a $25 pp price tag, it was good value, and worth the trip. Erin was our server, and she was both helpful and friendly. Location is conveniently located in Coal Harbour, and we also lucked out with a mountainous view that day! The restaurant wasn t too busy, so noise was moderate and seating comfortable.",

We stayed 3 days and nights and had everything from the delicious breakfast buffet, beautiful dinner ( the share platter and ravioli were BIG hits) to a few cocktails and snacks at the bar. We had consistently fantastic, fun and genuinely caring service at every turn. This was a a special girls trip as our guest of honour has had a tragic year and very much needed to destress. The playful  banter and extra care was especially appreciated! Thanks so much to Pavel, Jessica, Max, Raju and the fabulous James . Go see him for the kick butt pomegranate margarita!!",

My cousin was staying here and mentioned it after we had been shopping and looking for somewhere to have a bite and catch up on life. They have  happy hour all day so we decided to get a few side dishes and share. Probly best idea ever. They make a homemade potatoe chip fry with a garlic mayo dip that will send your taste buds to heaven.  Ceasars salad is one of my favorites and this place didnt disappoint. The best Ceasars salad I have ever had. The service was great. The only problem was the food was so good that we didnt catch up on life we just devoured all the food. Its one of those places that you wouldnt come across unless you were staying there. I will be back with more friends to show off this hidden gem",

I have enjoyed the view, just wish it would last a bit longer... service is great everyone is very attentive. There is one person in particular that I think deserves extra recognition and he went well beyond his duties. Max (I think hes an assistant waiter? He serves the drinks and food but never takes the orders) on my first visit I could see he was watching over the tables and when he noticed someone needed more water he was quick to respond. But tonight he went the extra mile! I sat down to have my dinner, I had just come down with a cold and was loosing my voice, I ordered a tea, Max delivered my tea and ask how I was? I replied by saying I have a cold. He then proceeded to ask if I would like some honey? I quickly responded yes and shook my head. Shorty he returned with the honey. I then proceeded to try and open the individual honey jar and I was struggling. Max noticed and came right over to me and asked if I needed assistance. He opened the jar! Just then a cold breeze blew past as someone had just opened the door. Max noticed I got a little shiver and asked if I would like a blanket to keep me warm and I said yes. Shorty he returned with an airline blanket! Even the lady that was sitting a few tables down from me noticed how he went above and beyond! His service and thoughtfulness is what really made my meal that much more enjoyable! Thank you Max!",
