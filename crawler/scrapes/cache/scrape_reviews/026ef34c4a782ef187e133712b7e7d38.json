The bulgogi beef portion was a little lacking, but does taste good. The service was also great. One of the lady cashiers was very polite and served with a smile which is nice. Good recommend Note: the waffle fries with the chicken burger was a side order.",

I just had a chicken sandwich with a whole gigantic chicken breast in it. It was tender and spicy and came with delicious waffle cut fries, and I had a beer with it, all in a lovely diner with air conditioning and great ambiance.  I would love a bigger selection of local beer but on the rest I have no notes. Well done!",

            "review_text": "Visited today for late lunch. I had the best chicken sandwich I have had recently (based on my personal experience). The chicken inside the sandwich was juicy, crunch and well seasoned. The sauce and the slaw worked really well together. We ordered the OG hot chicken, hot and sweet honey garlic, and kids tenders. I personally liked the honey garlic sandwich more but the OG was also really tasty. Waffles fries were great too with a good portion size. Their house mayo was also delicious. Most of all, the lady who received our order was  so kind, attentive and friendly. The service was beyond 10/10. She even came to check how our food was and also to kindly interact with our son. Such a sweet gesture. The only criticism I have was that it was a bit cold in the restaurant. Got a tall can of beer with the chicken sammy, and this meal was so satisfying. Definitely going on my favourite restaurant list. Kid-friendliness: Kids tenders, great portion and flavour.",

Being a crispy chicken sandwich connoisseur, I had to fond out for myself. I was a little bummed to be told they were out of Thigh meat when we got there as chicken Thigh is superior to breast in every way, but I understand that sometimes you run out of things. I ordered the spicy sandwich and the bulgogi fries. When you order, you can choose the spice level. I chose the second from hottest option. It was not spicy in the slightest, but damn was it delicious. Easily in the top 5 crispy chickens Ive had. The fries were absolutely glorious. I dont know what was in the sauces and toppings but I just about ordered another order of them. If you go here, go all the way spicy if youre into that kind of thing and dont sleepon the bulgogi fries.

Hands down they are the best fried chicken spot in the city. Apart from the usually delicious sandwiches, they have added the double decker to the list which is two boneless fried chicken thighs(one coated in a sweet soy sauce and the other in a hot yang nyeon sauce), cheese, lettuce and house mayo stacked between two toasted buns. The sandwiches are huge and delicious. They also do Chicken bites tossed in a sauce. I love the ones in hot yang nyeon sauce. Try the Bacon cheese fries as well. You cannot go wrong with it.

I want to try every item on the menu and the prices are pre Covid prices - e.g. great value for money.

Mozzarella Skirt Chicken Taco: The shell was really crisp and the mozzarella skirt added a lot of depth to the taco, although the cheeseyness of it can be overwhelming for some. The chicken tender in the tacos were great of course. 10/10 would recommend This is best chicken",

I ordered the mild heat level which had a bit of spice to it but not so much that I couldnt enjoy the sandwich which was great. The slaw, mayo, and pickles all complimented everything well. Im putting it up there among the best fried chicken sandwiches in town. The waffle fries were how one imagines they should always be, slightly crispy on the outside but soft in the middle. Perfect for dipping sauce which the order did come with (mayo based chipotle style) and I also ordered a side of honey mustard. Will certainly try them again and explore other menu items.",

It s a flavour bomb.  Great thing is you can choose the level of spice in the menu as you order. We got Kimchi Rice Bowl, Hot Chicken Rice Bowl with amazing side dishes and their best seller Original Hot Crunch Chicken (thigh or breast)Sandwich with side dish of Waffle Fries or Yam Fries. Everything we got were perfect. This is a self-serve restaurant. The place is nice, clean and has good vibes  . The staff are nice and friendly. I highly recommend this wonderful place.",

Had the tacos, dirty fries and the burger - all were exceptional.  The restaurant itself is new in an old space so needs some interior design, I hope they can get to that soon to make it feel more lively.

My wife said her burger was great and I really enjoyed mine, if you enjoy hot food I would definitely recommend it. 911 was hotter than I had in the past from the food truck (I dont think it was available from there at this heat at the time) but I would definitely have it again.

I rarely find Korean restaurants with good service but this place is exceptional. The fried chicken sandwich is crazy good  it is juicy and the quality of the meat is A+. I love this place so much . I wish you guys were also open during weekday lunch. I am already thinking of my next visit. I wish this business nothing but the best. The food is 20/10. Absolutely delicious!",

My boyfriend and I are from Toronto so we have our share of good food but this is some of the best food we ve had in Vancouver, and Toronto as well! The fried chicken sandwiches were delicious, the waffle fries were cooked perfectly and the service we received was absolutely outstanding. Everything came out super quickly and we truly enjoyed our time there from start to finish. We ll definitely be back the next time we re in Vancouver!",

Looked them up on google maps and noticed they did open up a restaurant, so I decided I had to go there and try out their food! I went with the famous hot chicken sandwich with 911 sauce. Added on fried egg, bacon and cheese. It was delicious! Highly recommended! If you re in the neighbourhood, you most definitely want to check out this restaurant!",
