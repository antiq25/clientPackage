The atmosphere of the restaurant is vivacious and lovely and the music playing really matched the vibes of the place! We ordered the horchata, salsa and chips, chicken quesadilla, and the torta de pastor. The horchata was delicious and wasnt too sweet or bland and had the perfect amount of cinnamon. The salsa and chips were amazing and had such a great amount of flavour (the bonus homemade tortilla chips were also great!) Both the chicken quesadilla and torta de pastor were seasoned so well and I would totally recommend both dishes to anyone who plans to come visit.",

I could say so much about the dishes but today I will only tell you about the ones I have tried! Delicious tamales with that cream topping I was fascinated, the chicharron gordita is a delicious thing and the two sauces they give you as accompaniments wowwww amazing, the pambazo is delicious as well as the tacos. We ordered champurrado which is so delicious, the michelada is good, the palomas and margaritas are super nice, the prices are extremely good. It is worth mentioning that I made a reservation for a friends birthday, they adapted a table for 10, the service was very very good, the waiter made us laugh so much, we were informed of the tip included before paying, (many places dont do this) he took pictures of us, it made the wait for the dishes more relaxed. They kept the birthday cake for me and brought it at the right time with candles.... Thank you for your attentions, you have a very nice team and a taste in the food that makes you want to come back. P.S. Thank you for allowing me to decorate the table and the place . Hugs .",

Their salsa verde (green salsa) is so fresh and perfect. In other Mexican restaurants, the salsas were a big disappointment. Im a big fan mushrooms so I often go for the mushroom gorditas (with lotsss of salsa verde). The fillings are also very generous. My only complaint is how far it is from my place",

Carne al pastor Is my go to and this one is very flavoury. Also the restaurant is very clean, everybody is so friendly and the ambience is authentic Mexican folklore.

Both were spot on and so satisfying and I can t wait to go back and try more dishes soon. The salsas were also awesome and all the chips tasted fresh fried in house.

You can t go wrong with anything on their menu, but if you re looking for a recommendation the quesabirrias are the bomb. On top of great food and service they re always blasting awesome music that really resemble the environment of eating out in Mexico. Muchas gracias! I love coming here",

If youre looking for mexican food that offers more than just tacos & burritos, definitely check out this Mexican restaurant in Kitsilano. Our server was excellent at taking accurate orders and ensuring our party of 7 was always satisfied without hovering over us. Overall it was a successful birthday dinner and we all enjoyed our meals & drinks. Im not a huge dessert person, but their churros.... Soooo good!",

            "review_text": "This restaurant took my breath away from the moment we walked up the stairwell. For one thing, this place basically just opened up during this time of Early June, and this place is Busy; for good reason! The food is succulent, delicious, and its price is reasonable for how well it fills you. The key thing for me though is the Atmosphere. Mexican food is some of my favorite, but I notice many other places here in Van miss the mark when it comes to capturing that lively Latin Atmosphere. Here? The music is inviting and enjoyable, but its music you can chat under. Its not too loud, or too known, or too Party-Inducing. Its lively enough that you want to get on your feet, but calm enough too that it just makes you wiggle happily in your seat. The lighting is also Superb, and gives that sweet Sundown in the City of Sun kind of feel, and the decor is highly thought provoking and truly inspires a warm atmosphere. My companions and I were enjoying ourselves so much we found ourselves chatting with other smiling faces around while we waited for the food, which was a rare treat. It wasnt as if we had long to wait though, because even with every table permitted being filled, from what I saw everyone, including ourselves, were receiving their food before a full conversation was even done. Excellent service, Marvelous design, Stunning and truly delectable food that I could see was being appreciated. Its rare for a restaurant to so perfectly capture the essence of an Authentic Mexican Experience, but I truly felt myself drifting back to Mexico with every heartbeat, laugh, and swallow. A Superb place to visit, though I advise calling ahead as you arent the only ones who now know it! This place is abuzz with visitors, and for good reason! So go enjoy some fantastic food before restrictions climb up again, and send many compliments to the chefs from Kiko!",

Ive been on a 7 year quest to find good tacos al pastor here, and most places in town, even if they are otherwise great restaurants with Mexican cooks, dont make tacos al pastor anything like the ones in Mexico. Both the flavour and texture are usually wrong. The ones at Mi Casa were as close to the real thing as Ive found in Canada. Some of the dishes we tried, while all good and authentic, had small portion sizes in my opinion, but we would go back for the tacos for sure. Also, the service we had was excellent! Very attentive and friendly, (it wasnt very busy at the time we went though, just in case that makes a difference). In case youre wondering why in my quest I did not try this restaurant sooner, and its making you skeptical that I truly tried most Mexican restaurants in Vancouver, I just somehow missed it because its not in a neighbourhood I often go to and for some unknown reason its missing from many Best tacos lists.",

I love the people who work here (and the food). They seem like a natural part of the neighborhood and really want to do right by you. My table was a small group of four who came ate and drank in a loud robustness that would have been right at home in a GoT episode. They handled us well. Our food was great. I think it might be fairly authentic.",

Like others have said, it s definitely more authentic than the Westernized Mexican food we ve come to expect in Vancouver (no burritos or nachos in sight).

Their house made salsas are delicious too, and the service was very friendly. Definitely worth checking out, we will be back!",

I recommend this restaurant to anyone who has been to Mexico and has been yearning for real, traditional tasty food that has not been diminished by American ideas of what traditional, Mexican food should be!! I am not Mexican but my Mexican friends that have been there say it is the real, yummy thing and I have been to Mexico enough times to know the difference!! A shout out to Denise and the staff there that provide friendly and prompt service. The chicken flautas are delicious, the tacos al pastor as well, the flan is really good and do not forget to try the cafe de olla!! Prices are very reasonable and it has good Latin music in the background. Buen Provecho!!",
