The food took a while to come out but the chicken sandwich and burger was so juicy and delicious! Sauce is super good too. Little overpriced, $4 for can of pop, but was worth it. There is a bar downstairs and you can hear and feel the vibration of the music when you are eating. It was quite loud.",

The atmosphere is super aesthetic ~ I do wish that there was more seating in the Hundy area (instead of a giant yellow pole) without having to go into the speakeasy The Stockroom. But this isnt that big of an issue as the burgers stay fresh when you take them to go as well! Very yum!!",

            "review_text": "Hundy has been on my radar since their soft opening. I sat at home watching their instagram stories of people snapping photos of their burgers and fries. Yesterday night, I had enough, it was time to try out Hundy. First impressions, the music playlist really sets the vibe of the whole place. I love how they converted this place into a restaurant at night and a coffee shop by day. I also like that the take my phone number and text me when my table is ready approach. It s a counter service restaurant (like PDX restaurants) so while we waited for our table we ordered beers. Their beers are constantly changing but I had the Farmhouse 33 Acres experiment beer and it was amazing. It s a very refreshing IPA without too many hops and fruity flavours. Alright, 4th paragraph in, I should start talking about the food. I ordered the bacon cheese burger with fries. The sauce in the burger is what makes this burger amazing. It s hard to explain what it is, but their secret sauce is boss. Bun, patty, veg, and cheese were all great sidekicks in this burger. But, the true Robin to the Batman were the fries. These fries  their like my crown jewel of fries  places like Cockney Kings and other OG fish and chips places. You think you come here for the burger, but when you leave  the fries are what you think about. My buddy Bryan ordered the bacon poutine with a chicken burger. I tried the poutine and must say it was worth the $7. As for his review of the chicken burger, he said,  I ll be back. . Once I posted the pics on IG, the DMs exploded with,  How was it?   Is the hype real?",

We didnt try the fries  because they happened to be having a poutine special that night, so we ordered two of those instead of fries. Absolutely delicious.

Inside the seating is bar style along the window with stools and a couple of tables and chairs outside, a very clean establishment inside and out. I ordered from Dave who was great. He explained what they offered and also made suggestions and pondered mixing and match sauces with us. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with the Hundy sauce and a poutine. We didn t have to wait long and they provide you with a buzzer so you know when your order is ready. I was amazed with the food and absolutely loved it. I have not had a great sandwich like this in a long time. Prices are not bad and the experience is straightforward order, eat, enjoy. Then come back again. I know I ll be back. Nice job Hundy. See you soon!",
