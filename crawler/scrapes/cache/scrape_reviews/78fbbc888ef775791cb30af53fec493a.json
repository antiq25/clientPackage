            "review_text": "This is an Italian restaurant that I love We visited at lunchtime and ordered 3 kinds of menu and tiramisu All the dishes were perfect The pasta was especially delicious The three of us were moved after eating this pasta The house wine I drank at Happy Hour was really cheap, but it tasted luxurious and it was enough to make me happy lunch time We ate tiramisu here after eating, and we were even more impressed ngl This is seriously delicious!!! Im still drooling while writing this review. Im going to visit there again and eat tiramisu The server was very friendly and elegant, and the atmosphere of the store and the music was good It would be nice if I could visit here on Christmas evening",

            "review_text": "I went here for my friend s birthday and we throughly enjoyed it. The ambiance was cozy and homey, it was perfect for the winter. I really enjoyed that the food here was made to be shared like a family style dinner making it really enjoyable and memorable. Food here was great and the house wine, it really can t get any better especially with the price. Starting off with the Panzanella and Carpaccio with red wine was delightful. For the main we got the half Rosticciana and the Gnocchetti and ended off with a birthday Tiramisu. It was perfect portion for the three of us to share!",

            "review_text": "Had an amazing dinner at this Michelin Bib Gourmand restaurant in Vancouver. We said we wanted to get their $55 tasting menu and they picked a delicious selection from their menu to try. Everything was seriously great. I will return very soon to try their lunch menu, which features sandwiches using the amazing Pane Casalingo bread! 1) Arancini - well balanced risotto balls with delicate flavours topped off with a nice pesto sauce 2) Pane Casalingo - this bread is seriously amazing and why Im going to go back soon to try their lunch. They serve sandwiches with this bread at lunch! 3) Panzanella (missing from photos, too busy enjoying food) - nice fresh salad with a sweet sherry vinaigrette. I love the vanilla pickled strawberries they add in there. 4) Carpaccio - high quality beef with   ubriacato di vino  buffalo cheese 5) Rosticciana - braised ribs where the meat just falls off the bone with a gentle nudge. The smoked cherry glaze was so amazing I had to stop myself from licking the plate. 6) Ravioli al Nero di Seppia - squid ink ravioli with sweetcorn that pairs so nice with the lobster and prawns 7) Coccoli e Proscuitto - this is a ** MUST TRY **. Deep fried dough is very unique and paired with whipped stracchino cheese and 18 month Prosciutto di Parma makes it an incredibly delicious must try. 8) Gnocchetti - excellent texture on this Gnocchetti, which is a smaller gnocchi. The flavours are wonderful. I loved that there was a bit of spicy kick to it. 9) Torta allolio - I love the citrus from the orange balancing out the slight sweetness of the cake 10) Tiramisu - this Tiramisu is very nice. It has a darker espresso flavour, not acidic, which I really like and the cake overall is sweet, but definitely not overly sweet.",

My younger daughter cant have dairy and we were pleasantly surprised she had enough options, plus our server let us know we could get the gnocchi with red sauce to avoid dairy. Whole family left happy and full! My husband wishes he could get the recipe for the cherry sauce they have for the ribs and my older daughter wishes we could get more of the ravioli!",

The staff were super accommodating, recommending what we could get in our half hour time frame. We had two cocktails and the carpaccio, it was the best I ve had in my life. The timing was great, the bartender serving us was super attentive, so at no point did we feel rushed. We love it so much we returned the next morning to try their sandwich menu. Fresh ingredients, chill vibe, and the verde nigroni was delicious. Thanks to the team for a lovely meal! Dietary restrictions: Thoughtful and accommodating to my allergy",

Beef tenderloin carpaccio with buffalo cheese and red wine mayonnaise was the top 2 carpaccios I ve had.

The service was attentive, which I appreciated. After ordering, it did take some time to get our food. I happen to love mortadella so was pleased to see a sandwich with mortadello as its focus. This had to be one of the loveliest sandwiches Ive had in some time. The bread was thin and not overstuffed with fillings (which I like). The combination of flavors was delicious and the sandwich was enough to fill me up. We also ordered a caesar salad to share and it was remarkably fresh with a wonderful lemony dressing. I wished there was a place like this in US where I live. It really was a unuqie sandwich that I cant recall having anywhere else.",

The dishes are a bit on the smaller side so I recommend ordering 4-5 dishes just to share and have variety. We got the Fritto Misto, Carpaccio, Coccoli and Prosciutto, and Ravioli al Nero di Seppia. Every dish was really delicious! Out of everything we got, the Fritto Misto (basically fried seafood + vegetables) was the most memorable. I have yet to have anything similar to this in Vancouver. I mean, yeah you can get calamari at a lot of restaurants nowadays, but the way they do it here.... *chefs kiss*. A definite must try if you come here! Will be back to try more items on the menu soon :-)",

Team was kind enough to squeeze us in the end of the lunch menu. Lamb meatballs with an amazing salsa verde, saffron potatoes with a garlic aioli (cant go wrong with that). The panzanella salad was really well received by the younger family members as well as the adults (simple, colourful, and refreshing). Orecchiette al ragu di cinghiale was an amazing combination and everyone loved it. If there was any criticism it would be the tirammisu (good but not great, was missing stronger coffee notes). Will be back for sure :) - Too hungry for food photos... next time",

I contacted Fiorino and they were so helpful and answered all my questions prior to taking our reservation.  Our server that night was so helpful in helping us curate our meal, based on our tastes and budget.  What a spread!  We samples 8 dishes at such a reasonable price point. I could not even sample the last two dishes I was so stuffed!  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a beautiful cozy venue with delicious Italian food.",

That house made focaccia is the perfect vessel to house all the delectable meats and cheeses. Really did remind me of Venice and sitting on the bridge and watching the people pass by. The panzanella salad was delicious with all the bright cherry tomatoes and pickled grapes (I think). The arancini was divine with the mushrooms and balsamic reduction with a great crunch on the exterior. We will be back!",

            "review_text": "Bright orange umbrellas and white table cloths attracted my attention to Fiorino. A quick check on Google tells me they offer Italian Street food. Although we are mostly off gluten, the idea of sitting outside on generous sized tables with white table cloths, on the artificial grass (no bugs) platform, and on proper chairs (vs stiff metal chairs) has a strong appeal. So, I informed and waited for my partner to join me. While waiting, the Coccoli e Prosciutto caught my eyes. The server explained that the big donuts are deep fried dough (oooh). Gluten free or not, we are having some. We also ordered Gnocchetti (might as well!) and Panzanella. The Coccoli was additive. They are super chewy   made from Artisan Italian sponge bread dough deep fried. The manager presented the dish and explained that the 18 month prosciutto di Parma will be the best prosciutto we ever tasted   yeah right! One look a the thickly cut prosciutto tells me that they are likely going to be very chewy. But I was wrong and the manager was right. Although the prosciutto was thickly cut, they melted in my mouth, and they were not too salty either. Wow! We are lactose intolerant, so the whipped stracchino cheese didnt sound that appealing on the menu. But the combination was absolutely delightful. Because of this menu item alone, this wont be the last time we enjoy a dinner at Fiorino. The Gnocchetti with boar ragu was also very delicious. Lastly, the Tuscan style vegetable salad proved to be the perfect match for what we ordered. At first, I was hoping to get grilled vegetables, but the Panzanella consisted mostly of raw cucumbers, a variety of tomatoes, strawberries in a sweet dressing. Very refreshing on a hot summer evening, but also cooling for the fried dough and gnocchetti. Perhaps we will come back with another couple to try the 45 day dry aged porter house steak for four! We returned for lunch, the place was a bit different. After taking our order for sandwiches, they ran out of zucchini and came back to ask if it was OK to substitute mushrooms. The mushroom sandwich was quite good. I found the prosciutto sandwich a bit too thin and on the dry side   I would have preferred more greens.",

And finally for the dessert we got the tiramisu and it was really yummy. The service was really good. I asked for drinks recommendations and our server recommended the Amalfi.

What i liked: 1) creative appies: they served me a small snack not on the menu (warmed focaccia bread and warmed green olives in with balsamic oil and vinegar). Nice touch! 2) large portion: The sandwich we ordered was a large portion (unfortunately no sides) and another fish my friend ordered fir Harte was a decent side dish. 3) happy hour: it s all day until 6! The longest happy hour I ve seen so far 4) wine price: their house wine is $1 per ounce! Location is great. Ambiance is unique. Prices are reasonable and the service was pretty awesome..",

Gio, one of the owners, was brilliant and he made the night very special with added enhancements and touches to the service. The Wild Boar Gnocchi was exceptional and definitely the highlight. Highly recommended, especially if you enjoy rustic and authentic Italian street food. Initial Review: Came here on opening night. Overall, the experience was positive. Anything mentioned here is meant as constructive as I know opening nights are often used to iron out the kinks, etc. Service was friendly, but a little bit shaky. A couple minor things like having to ask for more water, utensils, etc. Nothing concerning, but the service could use some refinement. The menu was appealing and we ordered most of what was on it. All-in-all, there were some items that were beyond spectacular and some that were definitely underwhelming. Ultimately, the gnocchi and the tiramisu were and are home runs. The meatballs were over cooked and the sauce was slightly bitter and not that desirable. Unfortunately, we found a piece of metal in one of our dishes (although I often don t fault the restaurant necessarily for this). The ambience was phenomenal and it s a cool room. Definitely worth a visit. I m absolutely positive that they ll refine a few things on the menu and with the service and it ll get up to a five star rated. Make sure you give them a try. Our experience last night was positive, although there is room for improvement with the food and service, especially the food.",

            "review_text": "A diamond in the rough located in the sketchy Chinatown area. Fantastic Italian toasted schiacciata sandwiches.    Didnt do my beforehand research on Italian street meats/food items, the menu descriptions were like a foreign language to me, saw the word prosciutto and ordered it.  Also ordered the tomato soup and arugula salad. Soup bowl size smaller than what Im accustom to, cup size was the size of a teacup. Sandwich arrived nicely toasted and already cut in two since we decided to share one sandwich, plenty of prosciutto with arugula and mushrooms which softened the strong prosciutto flavor profile. Prosciutto was plentiful, moist and delicious. Gio very knowledgeable and quick to explain and answer any questions from the menu. Part II- dinner menu Ordered: Patate Arrosto Polpo Frito Misto Gnocchi Great vibe at night.  Bar busy serving cocktails, house white wine superb for the price. Potatoes appetizer was fluffy and moist with a nice thin crispy crust, perfectly cooked Gotta be the best Gnocchi i ever had, perfect match with the boar ragu. Octopus tenderly cooked paired with tasty pistachio sauce which didnt overwhelm the delicate taste of the octopus. Seafood was lightly battered and cooked to perfection to preserve the flavors of the seafood/vegetables (squid, shrimp, onions, peppers, etc) Top all this off with a flavorful serving of pistachio ice cream for dessert Both lunch & dinner very enjoyable, especially with Gios friendly knowledgeable menu explanations and his obvious passion shines through.",

This place is owned by three hard working guys in their 20s. You can tell that every single part of the restaurant is well thought out and the food is excellent! It s a small menu but I actually like that. If you went over to your Italian grandmother s house, would she give you ten dessert options? No, she would offer you tiramisu but it would be fantastic. The plates are small but meant to be shared. Oh and they take American Express so it s great for a business meal. Highly recommended.",

Me and my boyfriend had the Vegetarian Gnocchi, Verdura Fritta and Crostini Misti (we asked them to make it vegan so they gave us the mushrooms & tomato which was soooo good)! Our fave was the Gnocchi and we ll definitely come back for more!! Their service is also top-notch   we got to meet Mitchel and Mario and they both explained the menu and even the ingredients to us. Hands down to our new fave Italian restaurant in Vancouver!!",

The food and house wines were amazing as well. The gnocchi, lamb and arancini were so good! The least favourite item ordered was the polpo - but understandably it is probably an acquired taste, however the sauce it came with was really tasty. Would definitely come back here to try out the rest of the menu.",

The host was pleasant and chatted with us about the menu, as it is family style. We ordered 2 entrees per person, which we found to be loads of food for our table.  The stand outs were the ribs with cherry glaze and the fried dough with prosciutto.  Delicious.  But everything we had was outstanding.  We ordered drinks and dessert and enjoyed the meal from beginning to end. Parking was not available on the street, so we used the parkade directly across the restaurant.  However, the door was locked upon our departure so we had to walk up the ramp. Our friends parked one street over (connected by an alleyway) and found the gate and the door to their parkade was locked.  They had to call the posted number to let them out.  It was only around 8:30pm.",

From the initial approach, the server was really welcoming and made great suggestions to our dishes such as saving our sauce from another dish to use as a dip with an upcoming dish which was stellar, by the way. I asked him (I forgot his name!!) for a wine recommendation and it was one of the best red wines Ive ever had. From the start to the end, my partner and I loved Florino and we are definitely making a trip to come back here when they have a new menu out!",

As the name suggests, much of the food served here is street food, so youll want to be comfortable using your hands to devour your food. The dining style is a bit different and very family and large group friendly. All dishes are meant to be shared. I love this concept as it allows you to taste many different flavours throughout your meal. Have a hard time making up your mind on what to try? This place is for you. Just make sure to bring along several of your family members and friends. Otherwise youll have to roll out of the restaurant. Enjoy. Parking: Parkade across the street. Street parking is paid. Kid-friendliness: Our teenagers had plenty of choices to choose from, but if you have a picky teenager the food here may be a bit too creative for the fast food junkie  . If they are open to broaden their taste pallets, it is a great place for them.",

I made a reservation for a larger group and the pre-visit communication was phenomenal. Both Mitchel & Gio were very accommodating  they were so quick with responding to my emails. The restaurant welcomes with you with such a warm and inviting space, even when we were sat in the middle of the restaurant! I was very pleased with the service, everybody was so genuine and helpful, which is sometimes not an easy feat for a large group. The food was amazing, there were so many options to choose from but the choices were still concise. My personal recommendations would be the Arancini, the Carpaccio, the Porterhouse Steak (preorder) and of course, the Tiramisu. There are so many more dishes I d love to try so I hope my friends and I can visit again soon!",
