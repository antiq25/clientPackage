Highly recommend the brioche French toast. Its crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The French omelette was perfectly cooked but there was a bit too much dill inside for my taste. It comes with fries but I enjoyed it with sourdough instead and made little egg sandwiches :)",

            "review_text": "My favourite place for brunch in Metro Vancouver! The food was amazing and the menu isn t your average brunch menu. Staff were attentive and hospitable. The Egg Cocotte had perfectly poached eggs and the tomatoes, olive, red pepper sauce underneath was a burst of flavour. The French Omelette, again, was perfectly cooked and the herb and cheese inside paired well and was not too heavy. I don t really like fries but I kept eating their fries. Every piece was crispy and even after it cooled, they didn t become soggy. The Maxine s Bacon were thick cut bacon with a slightly sweet taste. They also have regular bacon as an add on if you prefer savoury bacon. They don t take reservations for brunch and their peak hours are around 11am to 1:30pm. If you re a party of 2, you ll be seated relatively quickly. Larger groups will be a longer wait as most of their tables seat 2-4 people. They also don t have an indoor waiting area so I wouldn t recommend coming on a rainy day if you don t want to wait in the rain.",

It was out of this world! But the best part is the service! Our server today was Lydia and we ve had Javi in the past. The day manager was Maria. They are all super friendly and knowledgeable.

Some might say that the hash brown is too much but I love having more grains to go with my food since I eat a lot of food with rice, the hash brown complimented the meal so much!

After experiencing a sunny Sunday morning brunch here, I definitely understand why so many people love this place. We came in at 10AM, with a party of 3 and were seated right away. As time went along, it got really busy and the line built around the corner by 11AM. The interior is designed with a modern French Cafe vibe, while the service is highly professional and exceptionally friendly. We ordered the salmon rosti, dutch baby and french toast to share. The rosti and dutch baby are quite unique, delicious and beautiful dishes! The salmon rosti though, seemed to be our tables favorite. Unlike other places, we didnt leave feeling like the food was too heavy or greasy. The portion sizes are big, especially in comparison to other french restaurants in the area. We paired our food order with their iced lattes (definitely a must try, and can order them with either real milk or oat milk). Overall, Id say that Maxines represents the pinnacle of Vancouver brunch and I would highly recommend this place to visit with your best friends.",

I finally made the time to go around 10:30am and while there was a wait at the front, it went by super quickly (10-15 minutes wait which was reasonable unlike cafe medina s). Parking can be tough but if you drive further down near Burrard Place building there is street parking there (some free, some $2/hour). Hostess and servers were very nice and sweet. I sat outside in their patio which was super nice on such a sunny Vancouver day. When I wanted coffee to start, server showed me the boozy ones in case I wanted to try and I ended up ordering The Dudeness dalgona boozy coffee and it was pretty amazing!! Creamy and rich with just a bit (shot?) of alcohol; very yummy and high recommended!! Caesar was also tasty and came with a pickled green asparagus only. For food, one Google review mentioned the Dutch Baby being the  best value  so I ordered it without even knowing what a Dutch Baby actually is lol. So it comes in a skillet and it s almost a soft pudding-bread with ham, cheese and runny egg on top. It was pretty substantial and I couldn t finish it. Very tasty and the server offered to bring hot sauce, salt and pepper too. Also ordered an avocado sandwich and that was tasty; the avocado mash was mixed with something making it way more delicious than when I try the same at home lol. Overall the brunch was amazing and the lineup was always present and moving steadily (I watched while eating). There is also a side/back patio that s totally in the shade in case the front patio spots are too bright and sunny. Such a lovely brunch experience that I will definitely be back to try their other drinks which were the highlight and food (their french toast looked amazing too although seemed quite small).",

The service was also great, our servers were always checking in on us and super friendly! I had the oat milk latte and the Dutch baby. Both were fantastic! Coffee was great and the Dutch baby was so delish! Its really a heavy meal so get ready to eat a lot of carbs. My friend had the cocktail, juice and the breakfast sandwich which she said was also very good. Very generous portions for sure! The only downside is that the space is not really wheelchair accessible, toilets too. Overall, we had a great time and I can totally see why this place is always crowded! Will definitely return!",

Staff are extremely friendly and helpful with choosing your meal. The food is delicious, lots of flavor and decent portion sizes although the prices are pretty high. But you pay for the experience and the service on top of just the food. This spot is great for date nights especially. Its got a few dozen tables inside, some outside and a bar area as well. Id recommend making reservations as they get pretty busy, especially around the weekend. Beets and burrata is pretty solid, and their steak is cooked wonderfully. Kid friendly as well which is always a plus.",

We showed up 10 min before opening time and they were able to accommodate us. The decor was very nice and they had comfortable seating. Perfect for a family. We had their Egg Cocotte and the Smoked Salmon Rosti. Both dishes were very good.  The Egg Cocotte was very flavorful and the egg was cooked perfectly. The tomatoes went very well with the egg and cheese. The Smoked Salmon Rosti was amazing. Although the ingredients seem heavy, it did not feel heavy at all. It was seasoned perfectly and the egg and Rosti was cooked perfectly as well. Oh, their cappuccino and latte were great as well. Hope to return to try their lunch and dinner menu some time.",

(Can t wait to go through the whole menu.) The West End breakfast plate was tasty and filling. The latte was slightly on the bitter side for my taste, but the giant portion of spongy coffee cake balanced that out for me. Welcome to the West End, Maxine s!",

Second is a mushroom and onion tart with poached egg and not sure about the cream sauce but was SO good!

I chose the dutch baby which was delicious. It is definitely a combination of savoury and sweet. I loved the melted beschamel cheese that they poured on top. I would give this a try if you havent already! My cousin had the hash with the hollandaise on the side since shes pregnant. I ended up eating the hollandaise myself because it was so good lol. It was mixed with dijon and super tasty. The meat that came with the hash was also so good and had the right amount of fat mixed with meat. The bottom hash layer was perfectly cripsy and not too oily. I enjoyed the food here and the ambience and would love to come back and try more on the menu!",

We each had an appetizer (mine was the fried chicken, crispy sweet and hot!) and a large burger that came with fries or a salad at $15. I would definitely come in again to try their other appies on the hh menu.",
