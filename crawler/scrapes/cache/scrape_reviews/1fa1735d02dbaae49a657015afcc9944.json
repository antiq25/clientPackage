I believe they achieved it.  Today is my first time here and bought some Chinese dishes for tonight s dinner.  I was surprised to see how much they served for my order.  Unlike some other places that  provide mediocre quantity or just fill it to the container.  Tantos Kitchen staff filled my order above the container.  I like it  .   Service was excellent as well.  Food quality is excellent too!  Tantos Kitchen also serve ice cream.  All foods are take out only so bring your own bag.",
