(What with the name I have on my post !lol)  here goes if you have ever uncounted a retail store that normally the people that work there are nice somewhat helpful somewhat knowledgeable then I suggest you just keep going there BUT if you truely want a store that leans towards making you feel like family not like just a friend of that family but like your true family . People if I were you Id be heading over there with my scrips in hand and asking could I please transfer all my prescriptions over to you cause I know youll take care me like Im family  NEED I say more ! K look it these people that work there have gone way and I mean way out of there way to help me out when I was I need . Way above  the call of there duty  as pharmacists ! All yous out there do yourself a favor just go and see for your selfs . And you dont need to bring anything with you just yourself and they will do the rest keep up the good work guys thank you!",

Not organized, we went for flu shot and covid vaccination (they said no appointment needed), we were told to wait for 10 minutes to see the pharmacist who came and said to wait for 20 minutes as he was busy, at the end of 15 mins, he said he needs to give shots to other people who have appointment, so it means to wait for another 20-30 mins....not sure how they manage the walk-in and people with appointment but it was a waste of time for us. 2. Not professional, were asked to write down all our personal info on a blank paper (not a formal form with the short questionnaire and signature etc like other pharmacies do). So not sure how strictly they manage the patients personal info written on the plank papers...",
