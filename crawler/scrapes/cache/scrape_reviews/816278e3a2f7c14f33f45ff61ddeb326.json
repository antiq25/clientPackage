Both bowls looked great when I got them back and tasted fantastic. Fresh veg and flavoursome rice. The beef was juicy and the falafel was crispy on the outside and soft inside. Highly recommend.",

            "review_text": "I recently visited Superbaba for the first time and was impressed enough to want to return. Although Im not typically inclined to spend a lot on food, I hesitated when I saw the $15 price tag for the dish I wanted. However, after observing others orders, I decided to give it a try, and Im glad I did. I chose the chicken bowl, and the Middle Eastern flavors were fantastic, while the portion size was adequate. The only downside was that the restaurant was a bit chilly, but since its located near the entrance and its freezing outside, this is likely the case for most places along Main Street. I had a great experience here and enjoyed the shawarma. The meat was very flavorful and everything appeared to be fresh. The portion size was decent, although the bowl had more veggies than meat. Additionally, the cost was a bit high, but overall it was a positive experience. Its worth noting that all the meat served is Halal.",

Everybody was very happy and the food disappeared very quickly, leaving only satisfied customers. Sort of like the best, healthiest, street trick food you could imagine. Not cheap, but way cheaper than   and just as as good as   a regular restaurant serving the same kinds of dishes. Will definite do again.",

CRISPY EGGPLANT BOWL $15.50 Battered & fried eggplant, seasoned egg, tomato & cucumber salad, pickles, hummus, tahini, shug, and amba.  So many different flavours, I would get this bowl again and again! So good! 9/10 Would I come back? Definitely!

You cannot go wrong with the menu. Everything here tastes absolutely amazing. I love the sandwiches, especially the chicken one. The meat is tender & tasty. Also the addition of fries to the sandwich is a nice touch. The bread is freshly baked in house. Dont forget to ask for the hot sauce. Also their Falafels are the best ones Ive had in Vancouver. Another thing I love on their menu is the Sabich (Tempura eggplant). Crispy on the outside and soft inside. Superbaba is one of the very few places where ill pay to eat vegetarian food and enjoy it. Also did I mention their turmeric cookie is really good? The owners are super friendly and passionate about what they do.",

One thing I would change is putting the Cucumber and arugula salad into another container as it gets soggy within minutes of being in the same container as the hit food.

Since the opening of this location about a month ago, my partner and I have made a point of getting dinner there once a week, and it is delicious every time. Fresh and flavourful. The wraps, falafel, fried cauliflower, mint lemonade, cookies (both types are fantastic) -- you cant go wrong.",

I got the falafel wrap with an extra fried eggplant which was so good. I loved all the sauces and it was a nice large wrap. My boyfriend got the steak bowl which he said he really liked but wish it had a bit more rice or meat. Also got the mint lemonade which tasted super fresh and very tart but still sweet and nice. Overall great experience and really nice staff. Definitely try it!",

I will definitely be returning. The food was phenomenal and give the Mint Lemonade a try and thank me later :) Old Review: We went in to order take out. The staff were super friendly. Issue was that after picking up our order and walking to our destination to eat our food, we found multiple HAIRS in our food. At this point we had walked too far to go back and it was around closing time. Ended up not eating the food (besides this being disgusting, we are in the middle of a pandemic). I sent an email to the store with pictures, and the least I was expecting was a were sorry, we will make sure ALL staff whom are handling and/or exposed to the food wear a hair net. But instead, there was no reply from the restaurant. In conclusion, they make very yummy food, but I would caution you to check your food and perhaps avoid the restaurant altogether until the kitchen staff wear hair nets. Good thing is that you can see the kitchen staff if they dont wear hair nets.",

Unlike most shwarma places that are greasy and heavily decorated in sauces, this place manages to keep it light while still retaining an amazing flavor due to how well all the ingredients compliment each other. Highly recommend trying it if you are in the area even if you think you wont like it due to the ingredients, because you are probably wrong.",
