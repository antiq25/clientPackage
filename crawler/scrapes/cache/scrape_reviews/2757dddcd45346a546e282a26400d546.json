And when I did have to go into the clinic I felt exceptional safe with all the Covid protocol the office had. Only complain I had was that during my short visit there, some possible wait in patients did try to barge in while being very rude to the office assistants.

Although many people on here complain about the receptionists (yes, I think they need some more training in telephone communication, manners, courtesy, etiquette, etc.), I do think that this clinic is super efficient in my personal experience. Let me give you a few examples: 1) While the clinic my cousin goes to regularly refused to refer him  to a gastroenterologist, J-Von did it timely and soon he had the endoscopy and colonoscopy done; 2) While the clinic my cousin goes to never called him after receiving the endoscopy and colonoscopy results, J-Von called as soon as they received the fax and booked him immediately for a follow-up to give him peace of mind; 3) After J-Von prescribed my mother a new drug, J-Von called us a few days later for a follow-up. Besides, Dr. Zong, a young doctor, has up-to-date knowledge and is English-Mandarin bilingual. I want to ask you: How many clinics would go that far to do these? None! If you had an unpleasant experience here and if it is all trivia (like with the receptionists, etc.), come on, have some patience and give it more time! It cant be wrong.",

If I dont like one, I just dont go there anymore. And if I find one thats satisfactory, I will stay there. Im guessing most people are like me. And once in a while (if youre lucky) you will come across a clinic that goes above and beyond your expected level of service and knowledgeable staff. Such is the case with J-VON Medical and Dental. They have set a new standard of what customer service should be. They also have a very well trained team of medical experts and dental professionals. The first time I walked in I was greeted with a friendly smile by the super helpful reception team. They were able to book an appointment time that worked for me, given my busy schedule. And when I came in for my appointment they recognized me and greeted me by my name. How awesome is that? It really felt like a warm personal welcome. The clinics are always clean, and the place looks so modern. All the equipment there looks new and the technology used in some of these are pretty slick. The dentist who was assigned to me was named Howard. I cant say enough of his professionalism and respect. He works with his patients to ensure they have all the information to make the best decision with regards to the treatment plan or procedure. I highly recommend this medical/dental clinic because of the friendly knowledgeable staff, exceptional service, and highly trained professionals. And on top of that, they are so conveniently located next to Metrotown Station and super clean and modern.",

You are not happy, just because of that, your lips have to move and fingers have to type to let your anger out.
