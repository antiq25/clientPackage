All were a little different but delicious. Service is decent and there is some seating inside but not a very large restaurant. No real parking, although there is a paid lot behind the building on Richards. Give it a try. Parking: Paid kit located behind the building on Richards",

The burger was very delicious and served with a side of Lettuce salad. The taste of the food was delightful to the point that it didn t need any sauce or extra additions. The Volume of cheese used in the burger was appropriate and the price of burger was a bit expensive. There were also some large french fries on the side, which were good. It was served in a stainless steel dish, which I didn t like very much, but it s definitely better than a plastic container in my opinion. Overall, the food was good, and the restaurant s location on Rabson Street was convenient and accessible. The staff and the restaurant s master chef were excellent.",

The bread was low quality, the grease was not drained rendering it very soggy (see pic)...to a point that I didnt finish, and for a price point of $14.99 it was a super let down. Obviously for a sandwich which has a saucy base, youd pick a different bun than the others that strictly are served with only meats and veggies. A crispier and slightly robust bread would not only survive the gravy but welcome it with its crunch.....magnifying the texture and taste. The Brain & Tongue sandwich. Ok....so this meal is described as a mixture of both meats. There was barely any brain and mostly tongue and even that was scarce. Brain meat is much more expensive than tongue and for the price of a whopping $20.99 per sandwich it is way out of left field. The first thing you notice when you walk in are the high prices for what really is fast food. Sadly, the food didnt justify the digits. This corner is extremely tough with so many options, variety and incredible foods. Toranj I hope you strive to do better in the future. Best of Luck.",

It was a cold windy day and I was very uncomfortable. Two men came after me and sat whenever they liked. The kebab didn t taste good. I gave you two star only because the staff apologized, but remember whenever a women comes to your restaurant alone sit her in the best place possible.

            "review_text": "I visited Toranj Food on November 25th, excited to try their unique lamb brain and beef tongue sandwich. The price seemed reasonable at $21.99 before tax, and I willingly added a 15% tip. However, my experience quickly turned sour. Initially, I requested the sandwich to be cut in half, a simple ask that was overlooked. The wait for my order was unexpectedly long, and it was disheartening to see others who arrived later receive their food first. When I inquired about the delay, the response from the staff was dismissive, attributing the delay to the kitchen without any apology. The sandwich, when it finally arrived, was not cut in half as requested. The explanation that it was cut from inside was baffling, especially since it was wrapped in paper. It took further insistence to have it properly cut. The biggest letdown was the sandwich itself. Halfway through, I discovered an absence of the promised lamb brain, with only faint traces of it for flavor. This was not what I expected, especially for the price. Adding to my frustration, a review of Google reviews revealed that this issue with the sandwich lacking lamb brain is not uncommon among customers. This consistent problem suggests a pattern of misleading menu descriptions. Based on this experience, I cannot recommend Toranj Food. The service was lacking, and the food did not live up to its description. Disappointed, I doubt Ill return or try other menu items.",
