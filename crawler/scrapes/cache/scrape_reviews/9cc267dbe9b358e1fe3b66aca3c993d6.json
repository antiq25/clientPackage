            "review_text": "I had an absolutely fantastic dining experience at Johnny s  on Oak today. I made a unique order of 2 chicken breasts with spanakopita, salad, and extra tzatziki sauce. Despite this not being a standard menu item, Connie, who provided impeccable service, went above and beyond to convey my requests to Johnny. Without hesitation, they not only fulfilled but also surpassed all my culinary expectations. Having worked in the restaurant industry during my young adulthood and even having had an 8-year connection to a Greek family, my standards are exceptionally high. The chicken was impeccably moist and flavorful, while the spanakopita boasted a perfectly flaky exterior with a delectably moist and delicious filling. I requested a little extra tzatziki, and Connie promptly delivered it with a welcoming smile. In summary, my dining experience at Johnny s on Oak was nothing short of delectable, and I left thoroughly satisfied. The combination of superb food, exceptional service, and the willingness to accommodate unique requests truly made this visit unforgettable. Kid-friendliness: I noticed a couple of families in the restaurant during my visit.",

Got a spanakopita and a ham and pineapple pizza and it s like I had a slice of a memory. My family has been eating here since I think 1990 maybe before that and Alex and Kathy were the owners, now it s their son Johnny and his wife Connie and they too are such lovely people. I have also worked here when I was 18/19 years old and it was a pretty fun job.  I have had my fair share of pizza here, but I think it s to be noted that it still tastes just as good as it did 35 years ago. See you guys soon :)",

Well worth a try  .. sweet like Connie Johnnies wife and cute like Bonnie Connie and Johnnies baby. This place is where I take my lady for a lovely evening meal. All folder than good . Douglas",

At the table for entrees were two roast lamb dinners, a moussaka and a lasagna dinner. Everyone s food was tasty and filling. The service was very kind and warm and the vibe was most definitely care and welcoming. We will be back and this is our new go to!",

Ordered Calamari (it was cooked to perfection) the taztziki was delicious too, also had a Greek Salad for us to share, dressing was light & simple exactly how a Greek dressing should be! These were just our appies... for the main we decided on pizza....  it was to die for :) again some of the best I ve had anywhere! Perfectly sauced, quality mozzarella, and my idea of the best crust, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside not too thick and doughy at all!  The server was absolutely fantastic even gave us some free lemon pound cake for dessert!! The prices and portions were perfect... anytime I m in this area I ll be sure to stop in for a bite!!",

It was that good! Tasty sauce, lots of great cheese, good meat, perfect noodles and baked perfectly. Loved it. The server was very friendly too. Ill keep going back here for pizza and lasagna.",

Hands down this is one of the most consistent places I have eaten from! Doesn t matter if I dine in, pick up or get it delivered. The establishment looks are warm and inviting. Good space between tables to feel  covid safe . The staff are prompt, very attentive and I just love their  friendly like family  demeanour. And what can I say . THE FOOD IS SIMPLY AMAZING! All the traditional Greek dishes and authentic and delicious. The French Onion soup is to die for. The Ahi Tuna is a fave for me. The fried chicken burger you won t find a better one. And did I mention . THE PIZZA? Only downfall which isn t even a big deal is I wish the patio was bigger for those warm summer nights. What more can I say? Just go!",

It was light and fluffy and very well executed but maybe punch the onions though a dicer for a uniform presentation. Unless you going for the rustic finish then great. looks and tastes good too. Our mains were perfect and everything was cooked well to perfection. Thank you and have a wonderful evening .",

            "review_text": "Monday Labour Day I had family come into Vancouver. I went to visit them at their hotel and one of them decided that we should go to Johnny s on Oak. He read on line that they had the best pizza. I was in. We met a friend up there and after an awesome night I have to say I was quite amazed. I have worked in the hospitality for a long time, so it takes a lot to impress me. I have to say...we were greeted immediately at the door by two servers...the owner even greeted us. They help us find a nice table. The service was fast, efficient and they anticipated all our needs. The atmosphere was fun...great music and all the other customers seemed to be having fun. I would say that all the customers knew the owner. It was like a neighbourhood restaurant. The served looked professional. They didn t forget a thing. The pizza was amazing...thick, cheesy with a lot of toppings and so was the Greek salad and desserts. The beer was cold and the drinks were exactly what we ordered. They checked on our table many times and the servers were friendly. The owner gave us free dessert and he asked us how everything was? Yes, I am happy to write this great review!!! Congratulations to them! All the best in the future! I will definitely go back and I highly recommend!",
