We had early reservations which youll need to make at least a month in advance. We sat at the bar which had great ambiance. The staff did an amazing job of the small details and with the dishes. The charcoal udon was just so incredible. Out of the 6 dishes we got, the only one I did not enjoy as much was the salmon. It wasnt bad but I just found it not at the same level as the other dishes. Still for me five  !",

Most of the dishes we had were exceptional and a couple just very good what impressed me the most was the unpretentious nature. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and she would look up some info if she didnt know that her than just make something up. Its expensive for sure, but like some other Michelin star restaurants you dont leave wondering if the food and experience were worth it. If you want to spoil yourself have the $90 Japanese truffle omelette... Wow!",

            "review_text": "Good food with amazing service. Everything was done perfectly and there was nothing that we didnt like. Went with the omikaze and the recommended sweet spot for pricing of approximately $170 - $200pp. We werent too hungry so the waiter went more for higher quality food rather than quantity. The waitress asked a series of questions in order to tailor the menu to us a little which was nice. Youll want to make a reservation if you want a better chance at getting a seat. Walk-ins are possible but fill up quick. Paid street parking is available and relatively cheap (couple of dollars for the 2-3h duration we were there). Definitely a nice experience and worth trying at least once if you get the chance, but it is quite pricey. For the total price you could eat at a few nice restaurants instead, but lifes short and you cant take your money with you so as long as the wife is happy, youll be happy. Parking: Decent priced street parking. A couple of dollars for the 2-3h duration that we were there.",

Unlike other fine dining places I felt like this one is more informal and also provide bigger bang for your buck in terms of portions. At the same time the quality of food is superb. We had oysters, octopus salad, olives, spaghettoni, and chicken, everything was excellent. I recommend a la carte menu as it comes more affordable than prix fix and still lots of food to try. Overall unforgettable experience and I would definitely come back. It s too bad that it s highly popular and you need to keep looking at the booking it one month in advance.",

We had the octopus salad, the off the menu omelette (yes it s worth the price!), the udon noodles dish and the Tallarin. service was fabulous the only thing I d like to flag is that when we arrived we were surprised by a complimentary offering of champagne for our anniversary. We don t drink so we had to turn it down. Nothing else was offered in exchange and even though we did order two mocktails they weren t comped. It s fine. We didn t expect it but it does feel like a slight whenever the same offerings arnt given to sober people. Regardless I still left a 22% tip to the waitress who did a great job but it just left a bit of a sour ending to an otherwise perfect experience. Total bill for 4 dishes, 2 mocktails after tip was $250",

            "review_text": "Tried nearly everything on the menu- started with the half dozen oysters, fried olives, carne cruda, and octopus salad. The octopus, brined for 24 hours, was addictive- perfectly crispy and smokey. I wasn t a big fan of the cruda, the flavor profile was a little fruitier and more melon-y than I d expected. For the mains, we got all 3 pastas- tajarin, spaghettoni, and charcoal udon. The chef prepared a morel risotto for one of our friends, who s vegetarian. The pastas were clear standouts of the evening and I highly recommend getting all of them if you can (and the risotto, if it s available). The spaghettoni was our favorite- the ragu exemplifies Japanese curry at its epitome. Tajarin was incredible too. The salmon and duck mains were underwhelming compared to the rest of our meal. The salmon was very acidic, and the portion was tiny. The duck was perfectly cooked and the accompanying jus was great, but still paled in comparison to each of the pastas. For dessert, we got the cannoli, tiramisu, and panna cotta. In my experience, dessert at Michelin star restaurants tends to fall short of expectations, but not here! Every dessert was exceptional and perfectly balanced. Service was great, and our drinks were amazing. My beach club mocktail was a wonderful balance of sweet and savory.",

There is a whipped potato pate combined with bits of tuna, creating a whirlwind of vibrant flavors and textures. I then enjoyed the Charcoal Udon, which was exquisite. The noodles were fresh and prepared perfectly. A healthy save quantity was flavored with tastes of curry powder, lemon, and herbs, and it was combined with squid ink and fresh seafood. My wifes Shaghettoni was a curry flavored twist on Balognese.  We finally finished things with their tiramisu, which also had a Japanese flair, using soy and plum wine. Everything was delicious and seemed generously priced for the portions. I would gladly give Kissa Tanto 6/5 stars if I could.",

            "review_text": "What. An. Experience. I was lucky enough to snag the last walk-in seat at the bar as a solo diner at Kissa Tanto on a Saturday evening. It s an intimate but lively space. I was grateful that they do an omakase/chefs menu for one since many restaurants in the area require a minimum of 2 for that option. The tasting menu starts at $155 but you can  name your price  north of that amount for a more premium experience. I did the  standard  experience and was blown away (nothing seemed standard about it!). The meal started with a delightful pickle plate and then to oysters and a heavenly crispy octopus salad. Sausage-stuffed fried olives then led to the most delicious Japanese omelette I ve ever had (or really the most delicious egg dish of any kind I ve ever had). It was so rich and decadent with the brown butter and king crab meat. A fresh, egg yolk pasta followed (not pictured) and a beautifully composed salmon rounded out the night. Dessert was a matcha dusted blueberry mascarpone cannoli. Every bite of food was so elegant and flavorful. It s such an interesting marriage of Japanese and Italian flavors and techniques. For drinks, I had the shore leave martini which I very much recommend for any martini drinker. Besides the outstanding food, I think this may have been the best service I ve ever had at a restaurant. The bartenders who took care of me, Cassandra, Fraser, Denis, and Avi were truly the best - genuinely kind people who you can tell love what they do. Cassandra was my main bartender and went above and beyond and then some. She had on-point recommendations for the food and drinks but then gave me a list of her favorite restaurants and bars in Vancouver. Not only that, she even texted a friend who owned one of the bars she recommended to let them know I was coming and save me a seat on a busy Saturday night. I have so much appreciation for all of these wonderful people. I d go back for the service alone!",

This was not that at all. I ve been waiting months to eat here and it exceeded my already very high expectations! We asked our very cool server for his recommendations to go with our entree, and he crafted a perfect seafood-centric meal for us: octopus salad to start, butternut squash crab ravioli that wasn t on the menu, leading up to the charcoal udon. We had some natural wine and dessert of tiramisu and yuzu cream, which I haven t had anything like before and was delicious. It was truly an intellectual experience. The atmosphere feels authentically refined and jazzy and transported me to 1980s Shibuya and I felt like a businessman that closed a deal. I was so engrossed in the meal that I forgot to take more photos",

            "review_text": "Kissa Tanto lives up to the hype. The fusion fare is refined and intentional, yet not lacking in depth or complexity. Execution and presentation was spectacular but not pretentious. Youre not coming here for the fancy service (even though the service was great) or the beautiful views, youre coming here for fantastic a-la-carte style food that leaves you wanting just the right amount of more. We started off with the oysters which didnt stand out. But then came our first appetizer, two ounces of delicately seared A5 Wagyu with a vibrant, peachy emulsion. The melt-in-you-mouth steak on its own did the trick, but the sauce brought it to a whole other level. Our second appetizer was a black truffle omelette. In contrast to the elegant Wagyu, this omelette was technically brilliant and beautifully messy. The truffle was not at all overpowering, and the eggs really stood out as the main star of the show, rightfully so. This was probably my favorite individual dish. The pastas were the centerpieces for me, they underscored the Japanese-Italian fusion and tackled the flavors involved masterfully. Surprising yet delightful flavors throughout. We ended our main courses with a whole flash-fried fish. The seasoning was great and the fish was tender. I didnt love the daikon soy sauce, but the meat was flavorful enough that I didnt mind eating it without anything else. We finished off with a tiramisu and a cannoli. The tiramisu left me a little disappointed, the plum and coffee flavors really overpowered the delicate and light mascarpone and whipped soy base. But the cannoli was fantastic, deep, and perfectly decadent. A refreshing side of yuzu ice cream helped offset the richness of the chocolate and matcha, which was much appreciated. Overall, Kissa Tanto was great and I would definitely recommend it if youre looking for unique and technically excellent food that you really dont have to try hard at all to enjoy.",

            "review_text": "I saw a photo of the deep fried perch a few months before their Michelin award and so they went on my list of restaurants to try. It was not until our friends told us how much they enjoyed the interior that I started checking OpenTable regularly for reservation openings. 5:30 is when the restaurant opens. We got a table at the bar and lined up in the rain in Chinatown outside Kissa Tanto with other keeners. When the door finally opened, we all filed upstairs to the 2nd floor restaurant. My partner and I were pleasantly surprised by the interior: nice level of lighting, nice looking lighting fixtures, nice colors, a bar that is not cluttered. Seems like everything thing was placed there for a photoshoot   a comfortable space that is pleasant on the eyes. The images that came to mind were women in short hair with cloche hats or sparkly headbands dancing to Charleston music. THE FOOD. Since there were a couple of items that we did not desire in the fixed menu, we ordered a la carte. The Burrata Salad was supposed to come with organic greens, but they were served with beets instead. Even better! It turned out to be the best beets salad Ive ever had. There were different types of beets, including dried, and fermented(?). All delightful, with their very own flavour, but an overriding tangy orange dressing. I particularly love the softened black pieces that almost taste like olives   I am guessing they are fermented. We received Michelin standard table service. Fresh plates and cutlery were provided for each dish, and the servers wiped our bar top between each dish. That really enhanced our anticipation of the next item. For carbs (Tender to the Tooth), we chose charcoal udon. The udon was made with semolina and spelt   very chewy, very delicious. The chilli butter provided just the right zest. The first two dishes were so good I wanted to order a repeat of the beets burrata and charcoal udon again. I guess thats a reason to come back again and hopefully, they still have these delicious dishes(!) Now for the deep fried perch. It was large enough for us, and so beautiful I didnt want to destroy it. We were told not to waste the meat in the cheeks but I couldnt identify where the meat was. In any case, it took us a while to extract the meat to make sure we do the fist justice. It was a fun thing to have, but next time, I might go for the sable fish instead, if nothing else, to reduce the amount of deep fried food in our diets! I cant write about the seasonal vegetables side dish because it was boring and I decided to focus on the fish. Now to dessert   it is not something we normally order due to our low sugar diet. But being able to get in to Kissa Tanto was a big deal and we werent ready to leave yet. We are lactose intolerant, the ingredient of the Tiramisu is soy mascarpone. So, we tried it. Wow, so light, and not sweet at all   We breathed it in! We have been to other Michelin Star restaurants in Vancouver. But this was truly the best weve encountered so far. If I can give six stars I would. Truly an evening to remember and repeat! And repeat!",

Well the food was crafted with expertise. Sometimes you eat a meal and it tastes good, but you know that they used bold and easy-to-use flavors. This was delicate, yet with enough power that it was leaving me speechless. Please, for your own sake, try the charcoal Udon - it may not change your life, but it changed mine :)",

            "review_text": "I am normally not a fan of of food like this: fancy and $$$. But I absolutely LOVED this restaurant. We got the autumn salad, fish crudo, octopus salad, charcoal udon, braised greens and whole fried fish. The autumn salad was probably my favourite dish of the night. I normally do not like beets and this was refreshing yet creamy and all the flavors worked well together. I still crave it til this day. The fish crudo and the octopus salad were both great- seafood tasted fresh and tender. The charcoal udon was very unique; I did find it a tad salty but it was otherwise delicious. The whole fried fish was amazing as well. I do not know what fish I was served but it was great - the soy daikon is mandatory to have with the fish cause otherwise its too greasy on its own. The braised greens were served with the fish but that was the one dish that I found I did not like. It was VERY bitter (not sure if they cooked it enough because it was honestly inedible) but thankfully it was just a small side dish so we simply left it so we could enjoy everything else. Yes, the prices are quite high but they obviously use fresh ingredients and the highest quality so it is worth it. I would definitely come back here if I had a special event. Also, make sure you have a reservation!! We reserved much in advance so we fortunately had a seat but it filled up very quickly because its a smaller restaurant and it is popular.",

The food (Italian & Japanese) and experience with Belinda S. made us feel so welcomed and at home.  We throughly enjoyed each dish -> here we go! Carne Cruda - Snake River Farms wagyu, nashi pear, charred scallion soy, parmesan, arima sansho, gnocco fritto.  My goodness, this was so delicious! Mezzi Rigatoni - nut fed pork ragu, tomato xo butter, sesame crumb. Homemade pasta and loved the crunch from that sesame crumb Organic Half Chicken - shio koji dipping sauce, herbed oil.  It was so tender and flavourful. Sablefish - nanban oyster mushrooms, chili salmoriglio, marinated currants, pine nuts, sunchoke pure e. My favourite dish as it was cooked perfectly and the flavours made this dish come alive! Yaki Onigiri- grilled pressed rice stuffed with himematsu mushrooms, Parmesan, roasted chicken consomme, pickled shiso, Piave vecchio.  Crunch crunch. Fantastic flavours with each bite. Memorable experience dining at Kissa Tanto.",

My only complaint is that they don t open for lunch! I d love to eat here in the day time so I can really admire the interior. We had the fried stuffed olives which were excellent. The octopus salad was super popular as it seemed like every table ordered it. Tender octopus with layers and layers of flavour. Definitely a must try. The tajarin pasta was also very good.  The steak was delicious as well.  Maybe a tad small for the price though.",

The food was equally as fantastic. Its best to dine here family style and share plates with your friends and family. The Carne Crudo, Tonno Mantecato, Octopus Salad were all excellent starters. I really loved the octopus as it was super tender and had a great smoky flavour. The Carne Crudo was like beef tartare elevated to the next level! The Spaghettini Nero was great as well. We had the whole, friend rock fish and we enjoyed it a lot! The fish was seasoned nicely and the deep frying kept it moist with a great crispy outside. Our server, Belinda, was friendly and attentive! Actually, all the staff were great. Service was spot-on! Cant wait to go back again!",

            "review_text": "Love this place (except for one thing which I will mention in the end)! The food was amazing   a fusion of Japanese and Italian, which are both favourites of mine. We had the Burrata, Truffle Omelet, Tajarin (very creamy and mushroomy), Sablefish, Braised Greens (this was a bit salty and was the least favourite of the night) and the Yuzu Cream. Everything was amazing but the highlights were the Sablefish, Truffle Omelet and the Yuzu Cream. The one thing to note was that while the Truffle Omelet was actually very very delicious, it was one of the specials of the night and our server did not let us know how much it was and I was a bit shocked to be charged $75 for the Truffle Omelet. It did not seem like it was worth $75 based on taste and presentation. I don t care about $75 but was not expecting that. Partly my fault, I should have clarified so lesson learned.",

Found this place through looking at Tomasz Wagners portfolio, it looks super cool in his pictures and it didnt disappoint me. It doesnt just look cool but both food and drinks were amazing. We enjoyed all the dishes specially the egg omelette with truffle omg!!! Two bonus we got: Our request for specific seating was accomodated. Our server Carolyn is very sweet and attentive, our table is wiped clean every time a new dish is served. She even surprised my fiance with a candle in our dessert for his birthday :). One thing I would like to warn you is the floor is quite slippery, just be careful, I almost caused a scene",

We ordered the fried stuffed olives and the octopus salad as appetizers, both options were excellent specially the salad with such a fine sauce. As mains we had the Tajarin pasta and the Wagyu beef, the pasta texture was so nice and could tell it was handmade, the beef sauce and the mushrooms were delicious. As desert they brought us a tiramisu as it was my Birthday, such a nice detail! Thanks so much! Oh and don t forget to try some of their cocktails :)",

The favourite for the night was the appetizer, octopus salad. The parsley and chili sauce was to die for in contrast to the crunchy, tender but chewy texture of the octupus. For the entrees, was sablefish, risotto (featured) and polenta - personally leaned towards the polenta due to its use of the yuzu balm adding a citrusy element to this heavy dish. For dessert, the tiramisu was so light and fluffy with the soy whip and the added sweetness with the plum wine was a nice touch.",

I could just let you know is cooked perfectly, all the moist was keep in the fish. The sauce is lovely with the fish, something taste familiar yet more surprise. Crispy smoked octopus, fresh and pickled radishes, mustard greens, parsley and chili puree salad. I just copied this from their menu, is exactly what they describe but they just couldnt mention the flavour. The octopus was fired lovely, great texture. Again their sauce add some magic to a salad. Tajarin cooked butter, roasted mushrooms and miso cured yolk. The chef knows how to play with the sauce for sure, the flavour is like mum, but i think is gods mum who make this pasta sauce. The pasta i would expect a little more al dente and maybe slight less salty will be perfect.",

Don t be shy if you try to book online and it s sold out. It s possible to seat at the bar on a first come / first served basis. My friend told me to take our chances arriving early. I was  mentally prepared  to seat by the bar but we were luck to have a table at 6pm provided we would leave before 8.30 as the table was already reserved for others. It was plenty of time for us to try different plates and sip excellent Italian wine. We will, definitely, be back!",

            "review_text": "Kissa Tanto is one of my favourite restaurants in Vancouver! Normally I m not into fusion food, but they ve nailed down combining both Japanese & Italian flavours and balancing their plates. The ambiance is also another big plus! Since covid, the seats are all spaced out and much more enjoyable then before covid. Bar is also great too, but try to get the bench area if you can. You must try their Tajarin pasta if you come, and if their truffle mushroom risotto is on special get it! I also really love their octopus dish and daily pickled vegetables. Drinks are always great too!",

The moment you enter, you are welcomed by exceptionally hospitable service and a charming interior that artfully blends Japanese and Italian aesthetics. The culinary offerings are nothing short of phenomenal   expertly crafted and promptly served to satisfy even the most discerning palate. The octopus salad is a must-try, featuring smoky, tender octopus atop a bed of refreshing radish and delicious sauce. Whisper the secret off-menu truffle omelette to your server and be rewarded with an irresistibly fluffy cloud bursting with aromatic truffle flavors. While slightly pricey, its a tempting indulgence. The charcoal udon, drizzled in sublime yuzu cream, is a dish you simply cannot pass up While the visually stunning whole fish delivers tender, succulent bites, although it may not outshine the other standout dishes in flavor. Dessert at this incredible restaurant is the sweetest crescendo: the ethereal tiramisu delivers a luxurious softness accompanied by enchanting Japanese wine notes, and the seasonal mochi tart is an irresistible treat you wouldnt want to miss. This unforgettable gastronomical adventure ranks among the finest dining experiences ever encountered. Dont hesitate to pay a visit and savor these culinary masterpieces! Parking: It might be tricky to find a parking next the restaurant, but you always can find a free spot on Keefer street. Parking is paid ~ 2$ per hour.",

The layers of flavours and complexity in the dishes shows the chef really understands how to bring out the best in his ingredients as well as play on the umami aspect of the dishes. In terms of drinks and cocktails they have a wide selection. Our favourite (and recommended must try) was definitely the tajarin pasta, octopus salad and yuzu cream dessert. I do suggest starting off with a cocktail but not all flavours cater to everyones palette. So ask your bartender for recommendations. Ever since Air Canada rated Kissa Tanto the best in Canada and Globe and Mail best 100 restaurants we havent been able to secure a reservation. I have to give Kissa Tanto credit for allowing some walk in tables. Without this I am sure most of us would never be able to eat here.",

We shared main dishes of Charcoal Mafaldine consisting of white ragu of lamb, guanciale, chanterelles and toasted nori. This was followed by organic chicken with ship mojo dipping sauce. The final dish was a large fried perch with daikon soy dipping sauce. This is a unique gem restaurant and worth trying due to its unique disjoin and flare.",

All this happened in out 1st two minutes. Right there I felt appreciated. The bartender was a phenomenal mixologist, crafting some truly delicious drinks. His version of an old fashion was off the charts! Also since we sat at the bar he took our order which he knew off the back of his hand and made some amazing recommendations. Tops on my list are the oysters. Wagu beef, tiramisu. If I write about every flavor experience I would need 10 pages. To keep it short every plate was well balanced, flavorful and just enough for sharing. Hands down one of the best experiences Ive ever had. Make a reservation well ahead of time and go. You will thank yourself later.",

Reservations are highly recommended and be prepared to have limited selection on dining times. I hate tossing 5 stars out too often. This place definitely earns it. The service, the atmosphere, the food, the cocktails all come together as a triumph. The eggplant fritters and octopus salad were our appetizers. Both were great for sharing. The octopus salad disappointed only due to the wanting of more octopus. Smoked a crispy, it was unfortunate there wasnt more on the plate. We both had the specials of the day for our main course. The tagliatelle was cooked perfectly and the seafood accompaniment complimented each other. No heavy sauces to clutter the flavour. The pork chop was aged 36(ish) days and brined. Crispy outside and juicy and tender on the inside. And the presentation. Just look at that and try and say no.",

Reservations are notoriously hard to get, but they do save the bar area for walk ins only.  Sitting at the bar, you ll think you have been transported in time, with mid century modern decor and vinyl records adorning the bookshelves.  The atmosphere is a treat, and the cocktails impressive, but it s the food that keeps us coming back.  The tajarin is spectacular, made with handmade pasta, mushrooms and a dusting of parmesan.  We opted for the truffle addition, but honestly it didn t need it as the mushroom flavors came through just fine.   The drinks are carefully crafted with meticulous detail, keeping with the Japanese Italian menu.  I had the Salary Man s Song made with tart yuzu, and I thought it went quite well with the tartare appetizer.  We did bring our own bottle of wine for a special occasion, but the BYOB cost is pricey at $45.  It s a gem of a restaurant in Chinatown worth checking out!",

We didnt have reservations but we got seated in a timely manner. The service was fantastic. The host and the waitstaff were super friendly, and personable. The food and drinks... everything was great. The pasta dishes and octopus were my favorites....as well as the one-of-a-kind cocktails. Everything was on point. I definately recommend making resos and trying it out.",
