It is expensive but it lasts 2 meals. Also the service is basically absent to barely existent but I personally like that because I m just there to eat! (Thus the 5 star rating, solely based on food). You have to try La Casita!",

We also tried the nachos and jalapeno poppers. The nachos had toppings on every bite (nacho fans will know how important this is haha) and the poppers were perfect. The service was wonderful. Friendly and charismatic staff! We also had some margaritas (mango and strawberry.) 10/10 would recommend this spot. Date spot or a night out with friends, the atmosphere suits any occasion.",

The (half) quesadilla was also spectacular. The meal itself was not spicy to exactly my liking (I usually put ghost pepper flakes on my Mexican food - yes I like it super spicy) There were a couple bottles of hot sauce on the table, however none of them were that hot at all. But, the unnamed house hot sauce was very delicious and well rounded, just not that hot. The meal also came with a set of fried chips and some dips. One was a nice light spice dip, the other was an interesting egg and avocado or cilantro dip. Also, the table water came in a really cool (what looked like) tequila bottle. We also ordered the fish tacos and loved it! Would highly recommend going here.",

            "review_text": "Really beautiful ambience. We came around 6pm and it wasnt crowded. My friend and I sat in a cute place on the left side from the entrance. There were pretty paintings hung around our table. The food was really good! We ordered: wings in hot sauce (on Wednesday its $6), Casita Salad, Veggie Enchilada and Churro. The wings werent spicy for me rather had a tangy taste and paired with the blue cheese dip, it was full-on tangy salsa in my mouth. I couldnt stop eating them! My friend did find it a bit spicy but she loved it. I had the Casita Salad which was refreshing. My friend was full with delicious looking Enchilada. I had to end it with Churros! It was crunchy, sweet and sooo good! Overall really lovely place with helpful staff! Will come again!",

They came from Miami to Vancouver to stay since Christmas and every outing has been awful! We walked out of a few locations on a night out, due to unfriendly customer service. we FINALLY had a successful and accidental find of this place tonight at 9:30PM on a Tuesday night! WOW Im absolutely recommending this place to all! Our server Omar was extremely helpful and nice. He made her a special virgin Pina Colada in a giant Fish Bowl and  even brought out candle lit churro and helped us sing Happy Birthday! This place went above and beyond anything weve seen since being here.. We found our new favorite place and with a wonderful menu and beautiful atmosphere right in the heart of gas town, it cant be beat!",

I had the eggs Benedict which was delicious and particularly enjoyed the potatoes. Also, when our server asked if we wanted chips, I was surprised to find that they came with 3 different kinds of sauce, each one delicious in their own right. My favourite was the green one... that wasnt guacomole... dont know the name. Youll just have to go and find out!",
