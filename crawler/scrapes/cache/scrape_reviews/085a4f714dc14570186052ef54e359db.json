So happy that they have thought about dietary restrictions. From how good their plant based patty is, it really shows that they cared. My burger had everything I d like to have on my burger. I really enjoyed the crush fries and tofu nuggets too! Will go back for sure. It d be lovely if they bring some sour beers too!! Vegetarian options: Yummiest veg burger everrr",

            "review_text": "Quality veggie burger joint in downtown! Walking into the restaurant, it s an order and pay before eating like a fast food joint. Very clean inside, ambiance is very comforting and the staff was friendly. The person at the till was super helpful with recommendations and I went with all his recommendations. What I ordered: Veggie style Cheese Burger, Single patty (Recommend) $11.50 Combo: Fries and a Orange Milkshake (Recommend) $11 This veggie burger hit all the spots for flavour, their in house sauce laying under fresh tasty veggies and the veggie patty was satisfying, slightly crispy but not greasy in a brioche bun. Highly recommend, the burger was super filling so warning the fries were very tasty as well but it was quite a lot! They fresh cut their fries thin like McDonald s but tastes so much better, crispy, thin and not as greasy. To top off my order I wanted to try their milkshakes. Staff had reco the orange milkshake and what a pleasant surprised that turned out to be! Reminds me of a cream soda orange pop but in a creamy milkshake version! Overall everything was super tasty, I d recommend taking your order to go if you re making it a combo but the burger itself was good enough. I d come back to try their vegan burger with the vegan bun. A little pricey here but tastes like fresh ingredients and quality ingredients, so worth the $27 bill with tip.",

Prices were higher than the Golden Arches or competitors but reasonable given the quality and service. I went with the single patty cheeseburger and fries. Delicious burgers, delicious fries. Perfectly messy. Perfectly cooked burger and fries. Excellent. Presentation was above what you d expect from a burger place. Washrooms were clean, accessible and gender neutral. Dining area was frequently cleaned by staff as soon as people were finished and leaving. I have no complaints and no areas to offer improvements, however, I did visit at 2:00pm on a Friday, your experience may differ depending on timing! Enjoy!",

Paris immediately comped our order this time and apologized. Again, no expectations and insisted he not but did so anyways - which was so kind of him. The staff kept saying we want to keep our customers happy. Super important and just adds to the amazing experience here.

This place deserves thanks for making a fast food veggie burger that actually tastes like fast food (anyone who doesnt use a brioche bun for a veg burger is just trying to poison you). And that root beer shake was amazing. If youre into tofu those nuggets are pretty much the best veg ones Ive ever had. Vegetarian options: Good for veggies and vegans.",

The small menu was actually a huge plus for me as it can get overwhelming when you have so many options. They have the classics and the quality is incredible. The burger was cooked perfectly. Id compare it to in-and-out burger but this is honestly way better because the bun doesnt get soggy. Fries are also the best (thin and crispy). Didnt have a shake but they looked delicious, will definitely try one next time Im there. Slightly sad I dont live closer, but slightly relieved because Im sure Id eat this multiple times a week if I did lol",
