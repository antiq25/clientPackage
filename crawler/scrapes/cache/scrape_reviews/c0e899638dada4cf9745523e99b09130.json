            "review_text": "Our first time in Vancouver BC and after a heavy days shopping we visited this restaurant, having passed it earlier in the day, for a quick drink. We initially sat outside at street level only to be directed to the roof terrace accessed by a lift - this was a fortunate move for us that was well received. Briefly; a stunning roof terrace with the kitchen open to the seating area. Not much of a view but the cool vibe, smooth fixtures and furniture and chilled sound track more than made up for this. Our drink quickly turned into a meal and several drinks. The food was excellent and not as pricey as the surroundings would lead you to believe. The waiting staff were as alert and attentive than any that I have encountered. A lush experience. I fully recommend a visit.",

            "review_text": "We went to Black & Blue on a whim - we had an old gift card we need to use from Glowbal, it was a sunny day in Vancouver, I had heard great things about The Roof - so why not go see? We were greeted by a lovely team of hosts who said they could add us to the wait list, and us, being oblivious (we did not realize the dinning room wasn t open yet), asked if we could sit at the bar and wait. They didn t even flinch, the bartender allowed us to sit and hangout while he prepped, within 45 mins they somehow had a table for us upstairs and boy am I glad they did! We very much so took advantage of the happy hour ordering margarita s (on the rocks and so yummy), sangria (could actually taste the wine which was a refreshing change), and then for food we ordered some fresh oysters (we re obsessed, sue us), the crispy calamari (marinated in buttermilk and spices to make it so tender and flavourful), the ahi tuna tartar (each bite was to be savoured as it was a melody in your mouth), the Quattro formaggio flatbread (not our favourite but still so tasty), and the prawn cocktail (could have passed on this, was good but tuna and calamari were just exceptional comparatively). All in all it was a fantastic visit, the service was amazing, and the atmosphere was a 10/10. If you re ever downtown looking for a happy hour spot, this is it.",

My girlfriend took me here for my birthday, and it was first visit and I would certainly come back.  We had the mussels to start which were by far the biggest I have ever had, and incredibly flavourful. I had the NY strip with Lobster Mashed potato s and my Girlfriend had the Eggplant Parm with some Brussel sprouts. My steak was cooked  medium  but seems a bit over for my taste. I believe it was cooked right, but my expectations on medium were a bit closer to their medium rare. They happily remade the steak for me with the second being a perfect cook. The manager Sumit was wonderful and very helpful during the whole service. We will most certainly be back",

Its menu is sort of a hybrid of Black+Blue downstairs and nearby sister restaurant Coast. We dined early to take advantage of the latter part of Happy Hour.  The Happy Hour cocktails were very nice, the related appetizers were tasty, and both were a good value.  Our entrees were amazing, including the impressive tomahawk steak shared by the birthday celebrant and partner. And, we finally got to use several gift certificates I had purchased last year for a special occasion. Definitely worth trying like all the Glowbal Group restaurants.",

The happy hour is the best out of any restaurants in this category in yvr.  We started with the charcuterie board and all had burgers that were so good!!  They made our daughter s birthday extra special with the yummy comp birthday treat.  The bill I thought was very reasonable for what we enjoyed. Special thanks to the lovely hostess Diana who made sure we didn t lose our table as we were running late and our lovey waitress Cara you both were so nice and made our day perfect!  Can t forget to mention how beautiful this restaurant is inside as well as the patio, well done B&B!",

The vibe is impeccable, and the food is top notch (please try the Mac & Cheese sticks).

I ve really never had such exceptional service. The food was great, the crispy cauliflower was delicious and the steaks were some of the best I ve ever eaten. When we mentioned we wanted to share, Ryan even made sure our steaks were cut up on a nice platter for us to share. Just all around great experience and maybe this will be our anniversary spot!",

They pointed to take the elevator and we walked in. I walked in confused and taking everything in. Then the hostess sat us down and introduced us to our waitress, Rachel. She was lovely and recommended some really amazing things! For our meat we had rib eye, Mac and cheese stick and more!! It was delicious! I was surprised at how well marinated the meat was!! Also lets not forget the drinks!!! If you live for alcohol, then Id highly recommend it!!! Its a good compliment to the meal!! Also had the butter cake and chocolate ecstasy for dessert!!!
