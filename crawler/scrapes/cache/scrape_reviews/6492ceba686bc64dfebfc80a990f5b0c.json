They cant even successfully change the phone number on record. Sometimes theres one pill more than the labeled quantity (2 pills per dose...) Shouldnt have a license to operate.",

A lady who looks like Indian who always ask you to wait 1 hr or ask to come tomorrow even if you had visited after 4 hrs of prescription faxed by your Dr. Also her attitude was very bad, no respect to customers, she never understands the patients urgency , I would give negative or 0 star here only because of her attitude, other 2 ladies were really good and explained and delivered medicine soon. Also they won t call you even if the medication is ready for pickup regardless of urgency. I don t see this issue with other pharmacies like Walmart, I requested Dr to change the pharmacy to Walmart.",
