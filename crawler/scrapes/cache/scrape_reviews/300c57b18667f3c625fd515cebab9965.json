I must admit, at first I thought, Huh, its in a pet store. It might not be the first place I would have thought to take our pets, but we love our neighborhood Tisol, and its close by in case of emergency. We have had great experiences here. Totally exceeded expectations. Dr. Uri and Dr. Hannah  are both very knowledgeable.  Together, they have now correctly diagnosed and treated: our Boston Terriers knee problem, my cats weird extra rib thing, an ear infection my cat has probably had for years, allergies, etc. Just when we were thinking Vancouver was some weird unregulated veterinary wasteland,  were so happy we found competent, professional, caring vets right down the street at the pet store. They dont try to sell you stuff you dont need or extract all your cats teeth to finance their vacation to Thailand. They do urge gold standard veterinary medicine, and while some people might not want to pay for diagnostic tests, etc., I believe they would only order a test  if they felt it was truly in the pets best interest.",

QQs growth is again, not malignant and I dont have the words to to express how grateful I am and how much I want other patients to know what an outstanding person and vet Uri is. I have had the opportunity to recently have worked on a project with him, outside of the office. He shines, not only as a vet, but as warm, sincere, and fun person. Theres a bed commercial in which one of the speakers says, I wish I could give the ____ bed more than 5 stars. I feel the same about Uri.   Andy Krieger, QQs dad  Vancouver  Aug 4, 2019",

Their Google maps opening hours here clearly show open on Saturdays, yet we came today from the other side of town to pick up medication, and the clinic has a sign inexplicably saying  CLOSED . We received a phone message from them last week saying our medication was ready to be picked up, but now when we phoned to check where it is, they told us there is no record of it in their system. Very disappointing. Would no longer recommend this place.",

            "review_text": "Ive been to this vet a handful of times, but have not had a positive experience.  Theyre supposed to be a walk-in clinic, but whenever I walk in, they dont have any vets available.  Either theyre not there or busy for the next 1-2 hours.  Fine, so I tried calling in for an appointment before going.  Appointment confirmed by the front desk, then I must have gotten 2-3 calls asking me to reschedule for various reasons. Finally settled on an appointment, then I go in and I still have to wait a long time to be seen.  Every other time I had to make an appointment and every time I had to wait 15-30 mins. Then there were the issues with the food.  I was sold a bag of prescription food that expired within a month of the purchase date, but I didnt know until I got home.  I asked to return it, but I was told they had a no return policy.  They said I was told that I was buying almost expiring food and was given a discount.  I was not told this, and the invoice didnt note this either.  Finally spoke to a manager and had to settle for a credit for half the amount. Another issue with food, I was quoted one price over the phone and when I went in to pay for it, they raised the price.  My dog needed it, so I couldnt say no...  Not happy. The vets there are good though, and attentive...  So it seems the issues really are from the front desk staff only.  Its a bit of a shame, as this is a convenient location.",

            "review_text": "We recently moved homes so we had to find a new vet in our area. I saw the reviews for Vancouver East Veterinary Walk-In Clinic so we booked our cat in here. Sadly, this was a huge mistake on our part. We took our cat in for her annual checkup. All of the documents were transferred from our previous vet to this one, so it should have her up to date vaccine information and other health background. Unfortunately, Dr. Shura didnt even pay attention to her vaccination history anyways, and despite our cat having gotten her 3-year vaccines in 2018, he said it was done in 2017 and then vaccinated her anyways. I didnt notice this until I got home and saw my previous invoices from the previous vet that said she last got the vaccination in 2018. A few days after we got home from the vet, my cats hair started falling out in the area where the vaccination was injected. We tried calling Vancouver East Veterinary Walk-In Clinic on Wednesday at around 10AM and there was no pick-up (they are closed most of the week, open only for limited hours in the afternoon), no voice mail, and no emergency line you can call. We ended up having to drive back to our old vet to get her looked at because that was our only option. I understand that adverse side effect may happen after a vaccination, but I am very disappointed that the vet misread her vaccination history and gave her something she didnt need, and also we werent able to reach them or an alternate number. When we were getting our cat looked at, Mr. Shura said to us that he doesnt like to overvaccinate animals because hell get our money through teeth cleanings anyways (he had recommended a teeth cleaning for our cat). I couldnt tell if he was a vet or a used car salesman.",

After reading the reviews for this place I took my puppy here for his shots, they kept telling me that he had access ear wax and hairy ears that needed to be plucked at 30 bucks a pop.
