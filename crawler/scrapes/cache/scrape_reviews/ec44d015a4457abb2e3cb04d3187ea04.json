Famous foods promotes supporting local, fresh, organic ingredients and they will go out of their way to accommodate finding specific items on your wish list. It always surprises me when people come down on places we actually need more of for things that are completely out of their control. Like a fridge suddenly breaking down and them having to discard of the cheese for the safety of the public but its now an inconvenience because they never anticipated that or warned said shopper that they didnt have a back up fridge laying around or that 80 years ago they never anticipated a global pandemic and didnt put the proper social distancing measures in place by doubling the isle size so shopper with their newborn could feel safer. They try their best and they succeed at it. We are lucky to have Famous Foods, the staff they employee and the farmers/farms they work with.",

The store is kept really clean, and the aisles are swept, and kept free of carts and boxes. It has been alot busier as of late, and the parking lot in the back is often full.  There is street parking also available, however during the rush hour that parking is non existent. The store is definitely worth the visit, and dont forget your reusable bags.",

Any who everytime Ive been in the place has never been full and the isles are nice and wide so it doesnt feel cramped. As Ive mentioned before this place has everything, Im talking every herb you can think of and some youve probably never even knew existed. Also if youre keen on making your own food such as yogurt, cheese, or beer then theyve got the stuff to help you along. As youve probably figured out by now the store caters to those who are after organic food so it was also nice to see meats as well that were non medicated as well as organic.",
