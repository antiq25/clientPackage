I like that they separated the noodles and soup so it wouldn t get mushy. It was easy to order online and the tracker is handy to know when it will be ready. The wait was quick even during the lunch rush and service was friendly. I will definitely be back to try more items on the menu!",

Followed by Chicken Nuggets and Wonton with Chilli.  Finally completing our experience with QQ Mochi.  The nuggets were crispy but not oily and yet so tender and juicy inside.  Chilli oil were a perfect balance of spice with their homemade wonton, and fillings were soft yet bouncy.  What to say about the Mochi other than  QQ , just perfect!  Great atmosphere, wonderful staff. Thank you, Chef Eric and your amazing team!",

It was surprisingly refreshing trying a drink thats more catered towards the western palate every once and awhile. I ordered the Chicken Nuggets with Rice and was surprised at how authentic the seasoning for the chicken was. Its heavily seasoned (which I prefer) and was fresh from the fryer--very juicy. However, for the amount I paid, I expected a somewhat larger portion but given the location, it makes sense. If youre looking for more bang for your buck, I would recommend giving Wow Full Noodle House a try! However, this restaurants service was swift and is perfect for an officer workers lunch break.",

            "review_text": "We came at lunch time on a Monday and it wasnt too busy at 12. Once it got to around 12:30, all the tables were full. We ordered the chicken nuggets with noodles and braised pork rice. The braised pork rice was heavy on the rice. The pork itself was very fatty which I liked but the flavour was somewhat one dimensional. They are very generous with the portions here. The chicken nuggets with noodles in soup was also generous in price. Lots of noodles. The soup was plain but enjoyable as it off balanced the fried chicken. The fried chicken was okay. Not crispy enough and also not juicy enough. The food was mediocre overall. Not too pricey but not cheap either. Service wise - food came out a bit slow as it was busy but servers are nice and dont rush you even though its busy. I saw the tables around me and they were all eating rice and noodles dishes. Their portion sizes are definitely on the bigger size so keep that in mind when ordering. Its a nice addition to the downtown lunch scene when you are craving Asian food.",

            "review_text": "My recent visit to Deer Alley Restaurant left me utterly dissatisfied and frustrated. Despite placing an order 40 minutes in advance, I was forced to wait an additional 30 minutes beyond the promised time for my food. The portion sizes were shockingly small, and the purported Taiwanese cuisine lacked authenticity. The poor service and abysmal quality of their beverages further contributed to my disappointment. Here is a detailed account of my unfortunate experience at Deer Alley Restaurant. Late Delivery and Unreasonable Wait Time: Upon placing my order in advance, I expected a reasonable waiting time. However, I was disheartened when my food was not ready even after waiting an additional 30 minutes beyond the promised time. This prolonged delay left me hungry and frustrated, as the staff failed to communicate any valid reasons for the delay. Such a tardy delivery process is unacceptable, particularly when customers make efforts to order in advance. Ridiculously Small Portions: When my food finally arrived, I was shocked by the ridiculously small portion sizes. The dishes lacked substance, and it felt like I was being served appetizers instead of main courses. As someone familiar with Taiwanese cuisine, I can confidently state that Deer Alley Restaurants servings bore no resemblance to authentic Taiwanese food. The lack of attention to portion sizes severely impacted the overall dining experience and left me unsatisfied. Lack of Authenticity in Taiwanese Cuisine: Deer Alley Restaurant claims to serve Taiwanese food, but it was evident that their offerings fell short of the mark. The flavors were bland and lacked the complexity and depth that is characteristic of Taiwanese cuisine. The absence of traditional ingredients and the improper execution of staple dishes were major disappointments. I had high expectations for a truly authentic Taiwanese dining experience, but unfortunately, Deer Alley Restaurant failed to deliver. Unsatisfactory Service: The service at Deer Alley Restaurant was a major letdown. The staff appeared disinterested and inattentive, showing little regard for customers needs. Despite the extended wait time, no apologies were offered, and there was a general lack of communication. The unprofessionalism displayed by the staff members further soured my experience. It is disheartening to encounter such poor service in a supposedly reputable establishment. Subpar Beverages: To add insult to injury, the quality of the beverages at Deer Alley Restaurant was abysmal. I ordered a drink, which turned out to be one of the worst I have ever had. It was poorly made, lacking in flavor, and resembled a watered-down concoction. Given the variety of excellent beverage options available in the market, it is unfathomable that Deer Alley Restaurant would serve such a subpar drink. Conclusion: My visit to Deer Alley Restaurant was an overwhelmingly negative experience. The untimely delivery, meager portions, lack of authenticity in Taiwanese cuisine, unsatisfactory service, and the disappointing quality of beverages all combined to make it one of the worst dining experiences I have had. I would caution anyone seeking authentic Taiwanese cuisine and attentive service to look elsewhere. Deer Alley Restaurant has failed to live up to its promises and has left me with no desire to return.",
