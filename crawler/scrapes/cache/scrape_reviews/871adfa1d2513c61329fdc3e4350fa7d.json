I havent had much of a problem at the counter or with wait times, but the first few times I filled a prescription they kept forgetting or failing to bill my extended benefits. Annoying but not awful. My biggest challenge is refills. The phone number currently printed on the bottles is incorrect. The phone number listed on Google is also wrong. Even the automated system you get when you call Superstore sends you to the wrong number. I had to get someone at the customer service desk to tell me the number, hang up, and redial it directly. I picked this pharmacy because I recently moved nearby and I usually get my groceries at Superstore, so this seemed like an easy decision. How could it be less convenient than driving 25 minutes across town to my old pharmacy near my old apartment? Superstore accepted my challenge and exceeded my expectations.",

I didnt understand what she told me was and i asked same question twice and suddenly both of staff(female pharmacist and pick up area staff) they were laughing in front of me which is ridiculous and very rude. This pharmacy needs to re-train your staff there, all the staff there was super rude and they need to learn how to greet customer and also need to learn how to smile at customer.

I did research after that to find out that the company manufacturing the solution either stopped or did not manufacture the 5ml solution.

I understand there are lots of orders to fill but if they know they are never going to fill the prescription in a said amount of time so why do they continue to tell everyone an unrealistic wait time. 35 minutes is alot of time to wait in the first place but when almost every persons wait time is double that.....STOP TELLING PEOPLE YOULL BE DONE IN 35 MINUTES!!!! If you would just tell people come back in an hour, then maybe youd have enough time to do the orders and your reviews wouldnt be so terrible.",

I dont know her name, but she is a girl with short hair and usually stand in the drop off prescription area. The story is I got the prescription from the doctor, and my insurance benefit can cover 100% my bill with the prescription. When I showed my insurance benefit card, she was impatient and said you should give me earlier. Why she didnt ask me earlier? That is okay, after she said this medicine cant be covered by my insurance. I said it is impossible because my insurance cover 100% medicine with prescription. She became very impatient and rude, and said you should check your insurance first, then come. I was really annoyed why I should check first? If I check, how I can know which prescription that doctor will provide me? After she asked me to go to another counter to pay the money in full, she left without any words. It is very horrible service and I feel really uncomfortable. I dont mind If I cant get covered by insurance, but she should treat customer with basic respect, not challenge and rude all the time. I still remember last time I was there and drop off my prescription, and asked her some questions, and she was very impatient as well.  I wont go to this pharmacy anymore, never!!!",

After seeing those doors closed, I realized it must be at the inside store pharmacy. When I reached the pharmacy, it was still before 8pm, but it looked like it was closed already.
