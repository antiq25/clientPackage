I was staying at the Pan Pacific for a work event, and felt like getting some sushi at 9pm. If youre also having a craving, definitely check out Miku! Im a vegetarian, my server Miles made some great suggestions that perfectly suited my tastes. He even made some great adjustments to what I was thinking of getting. Finally, the tea was a delicious matcha that was exactly the right temperature. (Im a tea enthusiast!) I would rate the whole experience a 10/10 Vegetarian options: Great vegetarian and vegan options! If youre a vegetarian, try the garden roll you wont regret it!",

I got the Miku Signature Selection and Surf & Turf Roll for dinner. I cannot recommend the Miku Signature Selection enough. It was an incredible selection of the menu, essentially a chance to try everything except the Surf & Turf roll. Everything in the Selection was delicious and novel. The Surf & Turf roll really blew me away with the addition of truffle flavor. My mouth is watering just writing this review.",

I didn t order a lot as I had a heavy lunch, but enough to try a variety of their fish. Green tea opera cake was also delicious - layers were the perfect consistency, level of crunch and flavours. Good atmosphere - it s light and airy inside, it has a stunning view of the mountains and ocean, and the place is buzzing. Service was professional, attentive and he gave his recommendation when I couldn t decide on two desserts. The staff at the front were polite when I arrived and left. Washrooms are pretty nice, there s dim lighting and it s relatively modern. I prefer this Miku to the one in Toronto. This one has a better location and view - it was nice to walk around Canada Place afterwards too. Overall, I d highly recommend this place!",

            "review_text": "Wow... Wow... Wow... bite after bite was a sublime experience in what Japanese fine dining can be.  Miku is a five star experience that deserves your visit. The modern restaurant is beautiful, clean, and perfectly maintained.  We recommend sitting on the patio where you can either people watch or gaze over the harbour.  Inside tables offer window views or a view of the open kitchen.  Its all beautiful and adds to the experience. Service is professional, friendly, and gracious.  We followed our servers recommendations and that was the right choice.  A team of people keeps the meal moving along and provides explanations of what you are eating. However, the food is the star here and that is how it should be.  The flavors are carefully paired here and you will want to give those flavors a chance to delight your palette.  This is NOT sushi to be dunked in soya sauce.  I think you will also be delighted by how their cocktails complement the food choices. Put Miku on your special meal out list and make an evening of it.  This is one of Vancouvers dining gems and certainly the best Japanese cuisine I have eaten.  I think you will agree.",

            "review_text": "What a great location to eat at. The depths of flavours attained here are quite spectacular. I had the Waterfront 6 course set, and wow....just lovely and quite filling. Their creative approach to plating/presenting each dish and customer service really stuck out. Honestly no complaints. The only suggestion I would have is to coordinate the waiter with chefs/cooks when plating the food at the table. The chefs/cooks struggled a bit explaining the concept to each dish and how to best approach it, as well as answering questions...the waiter overheard once and had to step in to correct the original statement on how to best consume the dish; I am assuming the waiter just has a better depth of knowledge and skillset to verbally sell/market each dish given their position and inherent responsibilities...This is me being overly nit picky though and should not deter anyone from visiting. 100% worth the trip. Overall, for anyone who loves japanese food, this place is worth the time and money. To note, the location is quite busy, so book ahead of time.",

            "review_text": "Food was exquisite, creative and delicious.  They let their ingredients speak for themselves and do not obscure their natural flavours too much.  Portions were quite adequate for the Miku Kaiseki, even considering I didnt eat anything the whole day. Service from the main server was quite good, but the commentary from the runners when they bring out the food was almost inaudible.  The environment was too loud and they spoke way too softly.  Also had the same runner ask me a couple of times if I ordered the Kaiseki so that he could clear my chopsticks, soy sauce or other unneeded utensils. Bit of a hiccup with the last dish of nigiri.  Waited for quite some time after the previous dish.  The whole dinner affair took around 2h15m which was a bit long. The view of the water was a little disappointing as the restaurant overlooks a freight shipping dock.  It was a little chilly too as the door to the patio was left open.  With the aforementioned noise, cant really rate the atmosphere very high. Still, I very much enjoyed the experience and despite the criticisms would rate it 5-stars.",

We then each got the smoky sushi combo (or something along those lines) and it had a variety of different nigiri, rolls, etc. The fish was super fresh and definitely packed a lot of flavor.

We started with a Wagu carpaccio with an egg yolk emulation and different sauces on top. It was expensive, different, and tasty. The Brussels Chips were well seasoned although a little soft for me. Aburri style sushi is synonymous with Miau which takes super fresh fish and applies a torched sear and a light seasoning. All of my offerings were outstanding.

Some of the dishes offered in the 6 course and 8 course meal are not on their regular menu. We sat at a table overlooking the waterfront. It was romantic and beautiful.

Now, this isnt your typical sushi restaurant, in fact, I would consider this to be fine dining and heres why. When it comes to Japanese food, presentation is the most important next to customer service level, and they are bang on. I absolutely love how intricate their sushi  layered to simplicity on a plate. Reminds me of a zen garden. The waiters/ waitress are knowledgeable of their dishes being served and super friendly! Dishes are, at minimum $20, but the portions are decently sized. (Anything with Wagyu will always be expensive). They do offer gluten -free and vegetarian dishes and non alcoholic drinks. (I had their Shiso Nojito and it was the most refreshing non-alcoholic Ive ever had. Not too sweet either). Overall, I would highly recommend it for first time travellers to Vancouver. Its absolutely a beautiful place to dine in! Dietary restrictions: Gluten-free available",

And sake pairing was late for one of the courses. Overall, this was a delicious meal and definitely recommended. We would have liked some lighter dishes that were not fatty-protein-focused, or slightly less portion for lower price (like the omakase platter at the end). Bring a large appetite if you are ordering this tasting menu!",

This is a good place for a celebration, company event, special occasion, etc, or if you re in the mood for some aburi oshi sushi. The location is close to waterfront, and if you get a seat with a view, it s perfect to just stare out at the water while enjoying a delicious meal. Everything is so well prepared and fresh. Service is top notch, warm, and welcoming. Check out the menu before you come here as it s not for everyone, but lovers of sushi and a fine dining experience will enjoy what Miku has to offer.",

Service is really friendly I would like to offer 15% tips with my bill. Wagyu sushi still the best I recommend and their oyster taste really fresh. Also you can enjoy the view for Vancouver river while you having those top level cuisines. Will be there every time I travel to Vancouver",

The set menu might have small portions but each bite is perfection and the amount of food you get overall was perfect - not too full but very satisfied, and the presentation was perfection. The wait staff was excellent, as well, always there when you needed them but they gave my partner and I space to enjoy our evening without being rushed. Overall couldnt recommend more if you can squeeze it into your budget!",

We had 2 servers, they were both attentive, friendly, and took good care of us. I appreciated the female server for recommending the Green Tea Opera dessert. I can see why it takes them 3 days to make this dessert as it was absolutely delicious. Can t rush perfection! The hazelnut wafer crunch in my opinion does an amazing job blending the amazing ice cream and green tea cake. We were given complimentary scallops. It was SO fresh and sweet. A great way to open our appetite. The Oysters we ordered was really tasty. In my opinion you didn t need the lemon or soy sauce that comes with it, because it was sweet by itself. I ordered the premium from the lunch menu and my wife ordered 2 specialty rolls. The premium was a great value as you got 12 excellent variety of sushi. What I loved about it was that you didn t need to eat it with any soy sauce as the fish was really fresh and high quality. Also the portions was very fair. We were stuffed by the end of our meal. Highly recommend coming here during lunch if you want to experience something amazing at a reasonable price.",

Overall it was still great and highly recommended. Lunch Shokai: 4.5/5. Came with two small appetizers, both tasted good. Most of the 10 pieces of sushi were good, except that the green vegetable one and ebi (would be great if it s amaebi). Sushi rice was a bit cold probably because we sat outside and waited a bit too long to consume.",

All the tastes were spot-on, textures were on-point and everything was just perfect! The sea urchin was a huge hit for us. The  Premium  menu option was also one of our favorites. The views are also amazing  seaplane, ocean, boats and mountains. What more could you ask for?? Finally, the service was great! The all took time to chat and guide us through the menu. The servers and workers create a fun environment. They are super quick and super friendly. Overall, amazing! Great restaurant, and highly recommend.",
