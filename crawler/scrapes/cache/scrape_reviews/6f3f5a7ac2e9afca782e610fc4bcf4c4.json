The food was delicious - we shared the veggie curry (which comes with fragrant rice, a beautiful salad and plantains), a side of roti and the coconut dumplings with mango butter (to die for!). The spicy plantain margaritas were amazing - our server added a special touch for us, so that made us feel pretty special. The staff were all so kind. After we left, we went back for dancing later. They played great music and it was a wholesome, fun vibe. The place is highly secure. We felt very safe inside despite it being in the DTES area.",

The location isn t the best but if you re looking for Caribbean food, this is the place to go! The old school reggae music playing in the background adds to the vibe. The employees don t seem to be Caribbean people but they have a good knowledge of what s going on and what they re serving. I would 10/10 recommend.",

Im giving it a five star however it bordered on a 4.5 as service wasnt bad but pretty slow. Possibly a result of pandemic and staff shortages and frankly if youre not in any hurry the service will be quite fine but has a little room for improvement. Bevies were outstanding and food flavours were fantastic.  Perhaps a few more items could be added to the menu. A great salad was enjoyed there.",

Portions are very generous. Drinks were great too. The only negative was really the experience downstairs. They have a bar/lounge with a DJ where we went after our meal. I dont know if it was the DJ or if one of the speakers was glitching, but it was really really bad. The volume would go to extreme loudness then back to low, then back to extremely loud and back to low. It did that for a solid 45 minutes. At some point it was loud to the point of it hurting our ear drums.  We left for that reason, it was genuinely painful. We ended the night at another bar. We were pretty disappointed ! Would ve loved to stay longer.",

The staff are amazing. The Chef is incredibly humble and warm. There is no risk to your safety. If you re driving, park at Tinseltown and walk over.

The DJs played all of my favourite old school tunes. Was feeling nostalgic! The bistro has such a uniqueness, it was decorated with vibrant artwork by local artists. They usually have various events that take place throughout the week and weekends.  There is something for everyone. The next time I make another visit to Van City, I will be sure to check out the restaurant next.",

It was a fun night; just exit towards Pender Street rather than Hastings Street, you won t be disappointed!

The service from literally EVERYONE was fantastic, our waitress was so happy to serve and make a great experience for all of us. I was nervous about the food that was going to be served because im a fussy eater but good god the food was awesome. The atmosphere, staff, food and even the room temperature (considering it was downstairs and quite packed) was all perfect. Kudos to all the staff for making such a memorable experience for me!",

The menu is short and sweet but offers various items without too much repetition. The items, pairings, and flavours are all traditional while still adding a contemporary touch that brings out the flavours rather than drowning them out.  The food was perfectly cooked, and perfectly paired. I ve never been happier with a dish in my life. The manager/server Jan was the perfect touch to an outgoing atmosphere. His comprehensive menu knowledge, recommendations and quick service was exceptional. The cocktails were perfectly balanced and made me realize that I had never had a proper Dark and Stormy in my life. Rum list was extensive, and the rum flights are a nice touch. The atmosphere is fantastic. The art, music, and venue downstairs is gorgeous and the service is incredible. All in all, amazing. We had the plantain with goat cheese as an appetizer, and the large plate oxtail. Drinks were two Dark and Stormy, Calabash Punch and the Mai Tai.",

Don t worry about the location, once you are inside everything changes. We made reservations ahead and as we were eating we noticed the lines were never ending which also included delivery/pickup orders. That really says something about their food and service. They have a great cocktail menu. I ordered the coconut jumby and my husband ordered the dark and stormy. For food, we ordered the jerk chicken and chicken curry wrapped in roti. We would recommend both dishes. We had great service, the staff was very friendly and checked in on us. I didn t have room for dessert this time. I will definitely be back!",

Then, we enjoyed a perfectly spiced appetizer called Doubles, flavorful discs of bread topped with chickpeas that worked so well with accompanying pepper sauce. Next, perfectly tender chicken curry served in a charming picnic-style stack of containers, a side of crispy fries and chicken skewers that melted in the mouth. Portions were sized well, so we were satisfied as it was with a little leftover for taking home, but how could we not at least see what they could do with dessert? We decided on the bread pudding, and didnt leave any behind. Warm, with the perfect amount of sweetness and a small touch of something that we thought was maybe anise? I dont know, but 10 out of 10, would eat again. This is only our first night in Vancouver, but itll be tough to top this meal.",

Combine this with friendly faces and pampering service makes me jealous that this restaurant isnt in Toronto yet. Visited here over half dozen times when in town for work and theyve yet to disappoint. I often read the low rated reviews before going out to eat and found the ones here funny. From the clubbing scene is average to scared to walk from my car to the restaurant to getting pepper sprayed, people have rated low not because of the food or service but because of incidents beyond control. I agree with 95% of the reviews of 4 or 5 stars and applaud Calabash Bistro for staying true to Caribbean roots 10 years and counting.",

The jerk chicken was excellent, good amount of hotness to still enjoy the food. The plantain , delightful as expected. I greedily wish there was more jerk sauce. Also ordered patties which were nice. Next order, roti!. Thanks for being my new fav spot.",

A restaurant that serves food upstair and like a club downstairs? Only thing is...we had a group of like 8,9 and it took over an hourrrrr to get a table, maybe even longer than that. WE killed time by going downstairs and having a few drinks. I got the vegetarian roti which was teuly a blessing. Definitely one of the best rotis Ive had! I was soooooo happy. Afterwards, we went downstairss to party. What more could I ask for. Shots were a reasonable price, I dont remember how much-but if they were unreasonable WOULDNT HAVE BOUGHT EM! lol. I had a great experience here. I was starving and didnt want to leave, but that wait did really kill me. But the food made me happy. There was also a rally friendly host that night who kept giving us updates, she plays a strong role in why we stayed. I dont remember her name but I was here the night of March 16th into the morning of the 17th, so please thank her. I want to come back here next time Im in Vancouver and hopefully the wait is significantly less because next time I JUST CANT (but I still probably will)! thanks so much =) Music was solid, enough to vibe to and it was an overall great time. They need to play soca though...",
