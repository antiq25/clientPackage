They dont have a lot of beer not wine selection, but we enjoyed what they had. Cosy atmosphere, great and friendly service. We will definitely come back!",

It has a great location right at the entrance to Granville island, and the atmosphere in the restaurant is great. We had the floor seating, which made for a great experience- the cushions were comfortable and it was a fun dining environment. We chose the dine out Vancouver menu. Each dish was presented well and was bursting with flavour. The food portions were very generous and made me anticipate my next visit and the other menu items I would try. The service was great and our waitress was helpful in giving recommendations. All in all a great visit, and I look forward to the next one!",

If you re going on a Saturday night, be sure to make reservations in advance, as they have belly dancers. The atmosphere is fun and relaxing, try to get a table on the cushions. We ve had many parties here and the Bally dancer engages with the crowd, getting patrons up to dance with her. Order a planter pot of booze and prepare for a fun evening. Now the best part, the food. The horseman s platter is always a hit, it has a bit of everything and doesn t disappoint. The potatoes are literally to die for. One downside is service can be slow, but to be expected in a busy restaurant. It doesn t sway me from visiting time and time again.",

Despite not having reservations, they seated us.  And politely said wed need to be finished in an 1hr 45m. The place was near empty; but by the time we left, there was not a spare table. The staff was very attentive, and the food was uniquely flavorful.  Next time, well make a reservation, bring friends, and sit in a room with cushions on the floor.",

I also ordered the Appetizer Cocktail Platter thats really good for 2 people. The eggplant dish thats included in the platter is so good! It was the favourite of our group.

First of all, this place really decked out in decorations because the moment I entered the restaurant, I felt like I left Vancouver. They even have an option for floor seating, which I believe is the more authentic way of eating their food. We came here for Dineout and for the $27/person price we paid, I thought it was worth it. I d say some of my favourite items was the lentil dip, which tasted like an extra garlicky hummus. Their pakawra, which had the best crunch the cauliflower, which came with a the vegan platter. I didn t try the lamb shoulder, but my friend said it was pretty good! There wasn t anything I disliked, but I will say the Baklawa was too sweet and oily for my liking, but thankfully it was a small portion. Overall, this place has decent food (which was well priced) but it s really an experience worth trying. It s a fun place for a date or a group of friends to hangout. They have many vegetarian and vegan options as well. I d love to try more Afghan food in the future and would recommend giving this place a try!",

When we first drove into the parking lot from under the bridge the sign was over the Megabite pizza shop and was initially confusing. There is minimal parking in the lot especially given how many businesses are in this building. The stairs up to the restaurant is in the middle of the long side of the building. The decor is an experience unto itself. From the fabric draping off the roof, to the tassel curtains around some booths, to the rooms where you lounge on pillows on the floor. There is no rush so we took our time exploring the menu. All the food was flavorful and well presented. The room was social and we could see what everyone else was having too. We will be back and bringing others for this great experience.",

Delicious food, i love that they have vegetarian options, and cool decor as well. Will definitely come back!",

The service was pretty good, with the server ably attending to the needs of our large group and never messing up an order. The food was excellent. I ordered a lamb kebab, which came with a yogurt sauce, rice, fried potatoes, and a salad. There was ample food and the lamb was extra tender. My mouth still waters when I think about it. One of the highlights of the evening was the giant drinks for 2 or 3 people. It was fun seeing two people with straws drinking out of a massive bowl. Another highlight was the belly dancer. Members of our group even got up and danced with her. Reservations are recommended, because this place is hot and always busy. I would eat here again, and recommend it to my friends if theyre ever in Vancouver.",

We requsted a table in the back room where we could sit in an L shape on cushions on the floor.  We were a party of 10 and it was a great experience.  The platters of food were diverse and plentiful.  The cocktails were delicious.  The vibe was chill and the service was wonderful!! We all had an amazing time and will be back!!",

Service was efficient and menu was extensive. We ordered the special platter to try a bit of everything. It started with a salad and pita with hummus and another sauce (not pictured). The entree platter came with a chicken skewer, a beef skewer, roasted lamb shoulder (the best part), grilled eggplant (the 2nd best part), and cabbage rolls over a lovely bed fragrant rice. There were also deep fried potato slices around the platter. The platter is recommended for 2, but there was plenty leftover, even between two hungry adults. The decor was classic and had a nice ambiance. The outdoor seating seems gorgeous (surrounded by plants)   I hope to sit there next time! There are booth seats and floor seats, as well as regular tables. The Afghan Horsemen lives up to their reputation. Cant wait to come back and try more!",

Being the first Afghani restaurant in Canada, this hidden gem offers delectable Afghani dishes for both meat lovers and vegetarians! I love the Kebabs that came with this dish as they were all super juicy. What surprised me the most however was probably how delicious the Pakawra (batters fried potatoes) were! The batter wasn t too thick or too greasy. The baked rice (aka Kabuli Palaw) was also very flavourful. This platter was worth every single cent. .

This time we got the Kebab Platter and the Horsemens Special Platter, which was split amongst four people. Its definitely a lot of food for four people. The lamb skewers as well as the chicken skewers were very juicy and flavourful! The lamb shoulder was cooked to perfection and just the meat just melted right off the bone. Along with the meat was various other sides, such as their fried potatoes, cabbage rolls (?),  as well as their Afghan rice. All of it complimented the skewers very nicely! I highly, highly recommend this place. You wont get a more authentic Afghan experience here in Vancouver!",
