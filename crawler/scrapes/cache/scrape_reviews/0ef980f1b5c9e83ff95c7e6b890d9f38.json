The food was fantastic and so authentic! We loved getting to have some Indian street food that we ve never had before. Everything was so good we went back the next day for brunch! A few things were quite spicy and I needed to get some yogurt to go with it, but I wouldn t change a thing. It was SO DELICIOUS!!!! We ll definitely want to come back here whenever we are in Vancouver.",

The ambience is so cozy that you could sit and have chit chat while enjoying the flavourful food. Today we had a take away from them , and let me tell you how amazing was the chicken sandwich. Samosa chat was much needed in this gloomy rainy day. We will  definitely go again along with our friends as the location is super convenient in downtown. Would love to try their drinks too as it seems like an interesting menu. Service is always top notch  and perfect. Photos can t do the justice as it s a takeaway, but quantity was more then good enough for two people. Highly recommended.",

Now, lets talk about the food, The menu is thoughtfully curated, featuring a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options to suit every palate. The flavors were rich, vibrant, and perfectly balanced, taking my taste buds on an unforgettable journey. Whether youre craving authentic Indian cuisine or looking to explore new flavors, Delhi Heights is an absolute gem in Vancouver.

            "review_text": "Dilli Heights is a just-opened cafe serving fresh Indian fast-casual food and drink, and some Canadian-style muffins and cookies. It s located below street level down a flight of stairs, so you might miss it if you re not looking. I didn t notice any way to get to the restaurant besides the staircase but I wasn t really looking so maybe there s something. I had a very lovely experience from the minute I walked through the door. I was the only customer at the time and the man working, Sayed, greeted me very warmly and was patient while I looked at the baked goods and gave me a good explanation of the different types of chai they offer (you can pretty much pick and choose the spice combination you want - cool). After I ordered, he invited me to sit wherever I like, and when I hesitated on deciding which table would be optimal, he suggested I make myself comfortable on a single-seat couch in the corner. I ordered a paneer butter masala rice bowl, an oat cookie, and a masala chai. The cookie and chai were actually brought out first after the cookie was warmed up. The cookie was very soft and a little buttery with lots of different crunchy seeds. The chai was excellent - no chai latte business, this is actual strained Indian chai. This one was on the mellow side and super smooth. I usually like bolder flavours but the subtlety of this was admittedly nice. Then my rice bowl was brought out! I was pleasantly surprised by both the size of this and the neat presentation. The curry was rich and vibrant but not heavy, and there were lots of paneer chunks! The spice level was perfect - there was just enough to add the right flavour. The tomato and onion salad was very fresh and the rice was also cooked perfectly. Everything was just right on. Although the food was slightly more expensive than what you might pay at the average fast-casual restaurant, the quality and portion totally justified it. After I finished was ready to head out, Sayed asked me how everything was and offered to clean everything up for me. The food in itself would have easily been enough to get this place 5 stars from me, but the level of care and attention to detail from Sayed made this a very memorable experience. Do these wonderful business a favour and treat yourself to a delicious meal here!",

We started with the momos, which were incredibly flavorful, followed by the mouthwatering pav bhaji and aloo chaat that left our taste buds dancing with joy. The star of the show was undoubtedly the amazing elaichi chai, a perfect blend of spices that warmed our hearts. Not only was the food outstanding, but the service was impeccable. Vanis attentive and friendly approach added a personal touch to the evening, making us feel right at home. Dilli Heights Bistro is a true gem in Vancouvers dining scene. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a taste of authentic and delicious Indian cuisine, served with a smile. Kudos to Vani, Sumit, and the entire team for making our visit unforgettable!",

Mostly I visit this place for Butter Chicken and Chicken Masala Roll. Also the chicken momos especially steamed are awesome. I cant describe in words how I love these items. An absolute gem in Vancouver! The Indian cafe and bistro captivated me with its top-notch ambiance that instantly transported me. The flavors of the food were simply divine, each bite a delightful explosion of taste. A definite must-visit for anyone craving an exceptional culinary experience.",

I am a vegetarian and there are many options available for us and from these I have tried Rice Bowls, Burgers, Momos, Pav bhaji and all the chaats. From all of them Aloo tikki burger is my all time favorite. Prices are justified and right now theyre giving 10% off to the students. Their chai gives me vibe of India not gonna lie. It has became my every day stop for chai before college. I would definitely recommend this place trust me you wont regret !",

            "review_text": "Food was delicious! Very well made and has the right amount of spice. We had the fried chicken Momos, veg Momos, bun egg, and karak chai. I will say, if you cant handle spice, be aware that the Momos are definitely spicy. But in the proper flavourful way, not the north American burn your mouth heat way. Bun Egg was delicious. Egg had a nice caramelized exterior and a creamy eggy interior. The dhaniya chutney inside really added the extra umph as one would associate with an anda pav. Karak Chai tasted exactly how I make my cha at home! Full body, creamy, but not over steeped and bitter. Be aware that karak chai is strong brewed tea boiled with milk, NOT masala chai that most north Americans associate chai with. They do have masala chai on the menu, so go for that if thats more of your thing.",
