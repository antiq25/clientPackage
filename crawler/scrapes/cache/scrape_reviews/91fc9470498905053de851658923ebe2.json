We also got a set that came with Peking duck. The portions here were enormous and you will likely have leftovers if you dont go with many people. Overall I would come here again for their set dinners. Service was pretty good too considering how busy the storefront was.",

            "review_text": "Newer restaurant that replaced Peaceful restaurant that was there prior. The GOOD: place was busy for a Sat night at 8pm so thats a good sign. Didnt wait long for a table for 2. Pleasantly surprised at the preset 2x combo meats + main + soup + 2 bowls of white rice for $56. So we ordered BBQ duck + pork, main was green beans w minced pork & soup of the day. The MEH: menu should have spelled out that the combo soup is the soup of the day; no choosing. We asked for hot n sour, but the server brought the daily soup instead. When asked why, she then said the combo soup has to be daily soup. I found the BBQ pork and duck very tasty and not too oily. The green beans w minced pork were perfectly crispy but not too deep-fried. Again, very tasty. Didnt care for the daily soup, as its just a thin broth w few veggies + few pieces of meat. Would have preferred the hot n sour Final bill w tax was just under $60.",

            "review_text": "Amazing new Chinese BBQ restaurant. I came to dine-in with my family and got their 5 signature dishes menu which included: - House Special BBQ Platter (Roast Pork, BBQ Duck, Char Siu and Soy Sauce Chicken) - White Pepper Pork Tripe Soup - Lobster with Sticky Rice - Baked Codfish in Yuzu Mustard Sauce - Baked Beef Rib Their BBQ is all done very authentically. Roast pork is super crispy with a good mix of fat and meat. The skin on the BBQ duck is crisp and flavourful as well. If youve had their BBQ meat from the same restaurant in Richmond then you will know what to expect here, very high quality and delicious meats. Being a Chinese seafood restaurant as well, you can expect to order your traditional Chinese cuisine from here. What they also have sprinkled in are some slight fusion dishes that you will not find commonly elsewhere such as the baked codfish with yuzu mustard sauce and the baked beef rib. Their seafood is very fresh (both the lobster and codfish) and the beef rib is so amazingly tender. Definitely would recommend both those dishes. Overall very happy a new BBQ restaurant of this quality opened up in the neighbourhood. Service is very fast and friendly as well. Even though its their first days of opening, they already have line-ups for take-out BBQ. Will definitely come back more often and recommend this place to all who are in the area to check it out.",

There are lots of Asian restaurants in Vancouver however this has got to be one of the top. BBQ is always a good option when going out to eat and this is not exception. The BBQ pork is so tender and flavourful and the roast pork is so crispy. Highly recommend!",

            "review_text": "Cantonese BBQ Seafood opened up in the former Peaceful location on Kingsway. The little mini mall has a busy parking lot but you can usually find street parking (both free and paid). Weve been here a few times to grab a quick bbq lunch combo. But we finally visited for dine-in recently. In addition to their bbq service, they have a full Chinese seafood menu offering. We ordered the 3 item bbq combo (you pick and choose which bbq items you want but we opted for the roast pork, bbq, and soya sauce chicken). While the bbq price is higher than the lunch combos, you get more meat. Not a bad price when you consider how much the price of bbq duck has gone up lately. The duck was good... meaty and juicy. Roast pork has nice crispy skin. A welcome addition to the area for bbq. Pea tips were good too. And I like that we received complimentary soup to start and green bean soup for dessert. Really want to come back here and try some of their seafood combos. Update: We did return in October to try a dinner combo with a 2lb lobster sticky rice with 2 bbq items plus 1 other dish for $118 (we picked the sole fillets with veggies). We also added the Taiwanese cauliflower with lap cheung and bacon. Again, you get complimentary soup and dessert. Bbq items were as good as before.",

BBQ pork was very tasty and juicy. Yet very crunchy skin. We ordered double items plate. Half duck half BBQ pork. Duck was good too. Deep fried squid wasnt as crunchy as it should be. Beef green beans was heavily sauced and load of black beans. Over powering the whole dish.  Lastly, eggplant tofu scallops. Good amount of scallops and tasted fresh. Tofu was freshly deep fried before cooking into pot. Very few eggplant.  Tasted a bit too sweet than savory.  Overall a little bit too salty. I will ask for less salt next visit. Service was good and fast. They were very busy. Yet they were able to take care of the basic needs. Polite and friendly. Overall, it is a great addition for this area for Cantonese cuisine. We have enough hot pot or skewers restaurants in this area.",
