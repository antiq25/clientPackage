            "review_text": "The first time I was here was 2020 during the covid lockdown. My roommate and I got takeout, and I dont even remember exactly what I ordered but I remember liking it. I was nearby recently and needed dinner so I thought Id try visiting them again, this time to dine in. I got the veggies and tofu curry on rice. Very good comfort food, flavourful but not overwhelmingly hot, and not oily, making it easy on the palate and the stomach. The portion size was perfect, with a good serving of tofu and lots of vegetables both in the curry and in the salad. I also had the  3 kinds of bean w/ coconut milk and ice . It s under the  drinks  section of the menu but theirs was more of a frozen dessert than a drink since the ice was a little coarse to drink through a straw. It was tasty though, with lots of the toppings. The beans were very filling. They were fairly busy but the food came out pretty quickly. The service here was a step above the hands-off service style that s typical of pho joints. The waitress checked in on me after I got my food to make sure everything was okay, and the whole staff team was really sweet. I think the decoration in the restaurant is fun, it s a little eclectic but not  loud . I would recommend this place over most other  express  Vietnamese restaurants for the experience all-around.",

Neon signs every where, it would be more busy. Makes it seem kinda dive-y but it s very clean inside. I think they d also do well if they offered delivery from Lazy Meal, SkiptheDishes or the like. Would hate to see this lil gem shut down for lack of business. Tried the rare beef pho with spicey satay coconut broth ($8.50), pork spring rolls ($6.50) and lemongrass chicken ($8.50). Huge portions. Each meal could feed two people easily. I d recommend that the restaurant cash in on the late night bar crowd from Granville st and stay open until 2am on Fri/Sat",
