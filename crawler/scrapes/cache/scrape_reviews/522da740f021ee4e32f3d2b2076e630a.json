They pretty much take their time as they please to attend their customers. When one calls them, they take so long to pick up the call, if even they pick up the call. There has been several times I contacted them on the phone and they did not even pick up the call. To me seems like that they dont even want to be there. If I could give them 0 stars I would.

            "review_text": "Do you like your time being wasted? Do you like to have managers be condescending to you? Then this pharmacy is just for you. Extremely slow service here and they dont answer their phones. After multiple attempts to reach them I eventually had to get the store manager involved to help me get a hold of the pharmacy. Even with the store managers help, the pharmacy still did not contact me. Feeling frustrated. I went in person to discuss my concerns with the pharmacy manager (Pouria Jalily), I asked for my prescriptions so I can deal with a pharmacy that will have better customer service. He did not want to listen to my concerns and was happy that I was willing to go somewhere else. He did not provide me with my prescriptions and advised me that my new choice of pharmacy will have to contact them directly to receive my information, he then tells me good luck in a very sarcastic manner. Go somewhere else for your pharmacy needs.",

I experienced long waits in line to drop off my prescription, and longer waits in line to discover that it was not ready, some time after they said it would be and at that point was told it would be five more minutes, not to get back in line, and they would call me.  I had to leave to pick up my toddler from school 15 minutes after that, without my prescription, so require a return trip to pick it up.  Very unhappy with the service here, I will not be returning. Edit:  I finally received my medicine, but was charged more than 5x what the same prescription cost at Shoppers Drug Mart exactly one week earlier, therefore I will have to expend even more of my personal time in order to resolve the billing problems.",

The store manager told us 4 people called in sick and this is a regular issue. He also told us theyre 500 prescriptions behind. No one ever answers the phone. Although youve provided your extended health on multiple occasions and nothings changed... They still cant figure it out and try and charge you. Been looping on hold for 1 hr and 30 minutes. Will be changing pharmacies. Update: Its been 1 week, the new pharmacy had called everyday to have our prescriptions transferred but of course no one is responding.
