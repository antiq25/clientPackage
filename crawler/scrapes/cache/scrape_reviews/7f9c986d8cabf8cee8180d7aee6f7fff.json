All the family physicians are very qualified at this clinic. There are a lot of admin support at this clinic for all the physicians working here so they can focus on their clinical work with patients. I highly recommend this clinic if you are in need of a family physician.",

            "review_text": "When my amazing GP decided to end her practice, I was thinking that it would be a very difficult transition in finding a doctor that would accept new patients but she recommended Forward Care Medical Clinic to me and I was accepted quickly and easily. The receptionist service level is very professional in my opinion. They have a lot of patients calling in and patients walking in and they handle themselves very well. No abrupt attitude given to anyone everytime I was there. The doctor who sees me is named Andrew Chiu, hes very professional, gives great advice, tells it how it is, no sugar coating. The great thing about FCM is if your regular doctor is not available to treat you, any one doctor on site is capable of treating you as they have your records immediately available to see your history. I needed to see my doctor one day during this Covid time and my usual location in Oakridge Mall was booked all day, they said if its really of great importance and I couldnt wait a day I could go to their other location on 41st Avenue and they could see me within the hour. Thats just super convenient. Totally prefer this than going to a walk in clinic. I definitely would recommend Forward Care Medical Clinic to anyone looking for a new GP. 5 stars!!!",

I think most of them are pretty nice.  Some sounded a bit more blunt when they are speaking in English because of some cultural differences in my opinion. For those of you who couldn t sign up along with your family members, talk to your family doctors regarding the situation, they have the authority to override the administrative staff and put you into their system.

            "review_text": "Long time patient of this clinic and the doctors here, but this one incident involving their reception staff was just appalling. Your reception staff must disclose to all patients that there is a $50 no show fee even for phone call appointments. To force someone to pay this fee after a phone call was missed for legitimate reasons ESPECIALLY when it was not disclosed upon booking is borderline robbing. Please reconsider your policy surrounding phone vs. in-person appointments and/or re-train reception staff to be more considerate of patients circumstances. It seems they can greatly benefit from a lesson in using discretion. Not every patient visits the clinic frequently enough to see the notices for themselves. It is the job of the front desk receptionists to make policies transparent. Such a shame to have encountered hostility from your staff after so so many years of being a patient (my entire life so far to be exact...). To expect us to constantly bend our equally busy schedules to fit into the odd schedules of all the doctors here is impractical and a quick way to lose patients. I am starting to think I am better off finding a different practice to seek health care. The current front desk team is truly mediocre at their job at best. Edit: reply received and read. Unfortunately it missed to address the point about reception staff failing to disclose such an apparently important policy. Still not willing to admit wrongdoing?",

If our patients are unable to make it to the time they booked, they are welcome to call in and adjust their appointment 24 hours before their booked time. If our patients have an emergency or a legitimate reason, we usually waive the no show fee and end with a warning. Phone appointments are just as important as in-person appointments, which is why there is a no show fee for phone calls as well. If you still have any questions or concerns, please email us at info@forwardcaremedical.com and we will assist you the best of our abilities. Thank you, FCM",

Most time  I visited her she had wrong information about my medical records and it made me feel she was not prepared before meeting her patient. It seemed it didn t bother her at all. During the meeting, she used to talk to me in an unpleasant way that she seemed she was very annoyed by me not understanding what she said. She probably thought I was a stupid. As a patient I was very discouraged to ask questions and I didn t feel like to keep conversation with her. There WERE times She didn t called me on time, or met me when in-person meeting(which I understood since she could be busy). But she was very impatient and even aggressive when I couldn t received her call on time when I was really sick. She called  7 times in a row  in total to me and my husband which I think is not necessary (she probably want us to receive the call so that she can yell) and said, we d better find another dr if we keep doing this. It sounded almost like a threat. I wish I could recorded the phone call I had with her. If you have a baby, don t take them to her since she seems she doesn t know how to treat with a little one. My baby was literally freaked out whenever getting a shot from her. It was horrible experiences as a parent, but since it s hard to find a dr so I kinda made compromise to keep her as my dr. Now I regret myself being too patient with her and didn t find another dr more earlier. Hopefully nobody had or will have experiences like me. Not sure if anyone from the clinic is willing to talk to me but I want to let dr. Song to know that patients are not stupid, and not her emotional trashcan.",

            "review_text": "Started to see Dr Amanda Lau before they expanded from a 2 doctors office. Too business type of services instead of a caring practice. No more than  2 questions allowed to ask  even if you have not seen them for so long! The office is so crowded like a zoo!  I was put on hold with that terrible ding ding music every single call & you will be told that the next appointment will be a week later! I feel sorry for those sick elderly patients if they need quick assistance! Even worst is when the elderly dont even know how to book the appointment online! Terrible office management with too many doctors working for Dr Amanda Lau, the boss, who only works 2 days a week, few hours a day. Expecting the patients to accommodate her schedules so I requested to switch to one of her staff doctors but no spaces were reserved for us, the loyal patients! I will never come back to this office again!",

Unfortunately, we can only limit our patients to one or two concerns per appointment as there is a time restraint. If we allow our patients to go over the 10 minute limit, other patients would not be able to have their appointment on time. We do however encourage our patients to book multiple appointments if they have more concerns to discuss with our doctors. If our patients require quick assistance, we do sometimes allow urgent same-day bookings. If you have any questions or concerns, please email us at info@forwardcaremedical.com and we will help you in the best way we can. Thank you, FCM",

When she retired she passed her client list over to another Dr who is still in the office to this day. She was my family doctor until I decided I wanted to switch to a new doctor within the same office. I found out recently that she has left forward care medical. And as a clinic that prides themselves of taking care of their patients. They did not pass her clients on to any other doctor. I called today to talk to reception to ask if I can see any other doctor in the office or even go back to the old doctor. This man said and I quote  you can not cause tech you re no longer our patient or part of our clinic anymore since you were dr - patient I understand there s a shortage of family doctors in bc and everyone wants and needs a family doctor. But this is truely heartbreaking to be with forwardcare medical from the ground up and for them to leave you with no doctor and no care. To give you an idea I ve been with them for 25 years.

I asked the receptionist, is this regular protocol? If so, why did you initially tell me that I had to pay a $30 fee and offered to reschedule? And what about the fact that I took time off work so that I could get to this appointment? Are you going to compensate me for work that I had to rearrange for this appointment? The receptionist sounded scared and just said I just do what the doctor tells me and wanted to hang up. And that was it.
