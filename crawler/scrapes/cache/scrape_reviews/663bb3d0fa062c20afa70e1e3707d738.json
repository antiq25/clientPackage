Im so happy I found it and Krishna! Ive been receiving concussion therapy for two months now and its like Im finally human again. I can walk, bike, and drive again, and my cognition and screen time tolerance is improving with the exercises. None of this was the case when I first started with Krishna. During my first session, Krishna quickly identified that my vision was affected by the concussion and that is the likely cause of my symptoms. It was a huge relief to understand why I was feeling so yucky and have a plan to fix it. Thank you so much!!!",

I should ve gone to my doc for a shot(which I found out later), but a week later, I went to MJ physio. She used ultrasound & tens machine to help heal. She told me about certain exercises that I should do to strengthen & stretching my glutes & hamstrings, as I wasn t in good shape to play golf. Doc said it d take 6-12 weeks, but I played my first golf 5 weeks after injury and I played better because I was more stronger in my core and glutes. I m still getting treatments b c of sore left shoulder & back and she s used shock therapy for shoulder and it has rapidly helped the shoulder. My back pain is also getting better. 6 weeks later now, I m playing golf better & I can run if I have to, btw, I m a newish senior. I m planning to check in with Krishna from time to time if I feel aches & pains. Thanks much, Krishna!",

            "review_text": "As an Indian Classical musician, I have been tirelessly working through sitting cross legged and playing my tabla for over 10 hours a day for 30 + years. Needless to say, both Professional Hazard and age has caught up to me and I need intense physiotherapy for my neck, shoulders, arms, hips and legs. Basically, a full overhaul of my joints, ligaments and muscles. I came to see my dear friend Krishna Jeeja at her MJ Physio clinic on Fraser St and 41st in Vancouver and started my treatment. I was quite nervous as asides from the few massages I have had with my wife at couples spas I have never been to any sort of therapy in this regard. Krishna completely made me feel at ease, explaining to me the details of my therapy and what was required. She made correct analysis on all of my problem joints in my body and exactly described my pain as if it was me talking. She is very knowledgeable on the workings of the human body. I feel an intense decrease in pain ever since Krishna started treating me, as a matter of fact I feel much better now than I have in years though I am aware it will take more than a few sessions to correct my body alignment. As I have been having intense pain in my ankle bones as well as my shoulders and neck Krishna was very quick in identifying the problem as bursitis. I assumed that only cortisol can treat this pain but I was hesitant of ever getting that treatment done. After Krishna told me they treat bursitis through laser  I am looking forward to getting laser treatment done in their Surrey location. I will recommend this place to anyone in need of physio. Krishna is kind hearted, professional, direct and an absolute joy to talk to. She is friendly and makes you feel at ease. Their facility has a nice gym, state of the art equipment and a very friendly receptionist. For the first time in my life I feel that I will get better and continue my work in music. Thank you Krishna and thank you MJ Physio for being there- and thank you for supporting the Arts in our city ( MJ Physio is one of our major sponsors for our Mushtari Begum Festival of Indian Classical Music and Dance) and selflessly donating your time to our Vancouver community. I give you 6/5 stars!",

            "review_text": "Update .... This year I have fallen in love with Pickleball, playing almost everyday. The problem , playing outside on the hard court surface almost everyday,  it was giving me knee pain . My family doctor said it is arthritis in my knees and will have to ice and rest my knees every time I play.  Went for treatment with Ram . He checked me over and said with my range of motion ,I do not have arthritis . Ram gave me stretching exercises as well as IMS ( deep needle),muscle contraction and other Physio treatments . I can happily say my treatments were successful with no more Knee pain. I have been going for preventative treatment now every 2 - 3 weeks and still pain free playing Pickleball or Raquetball everyday .  I tell my story to anyone who has any sports pain. Ram gets my highest recommendation....Thanks so much Ram! posted 2019 : I was unsuccessful  with massage therapy  and chiropractors for my sports lower back pain. After one treatment with MJ Physio I felt less pain and could continue my gym and raquet sports workouts . After 4 treatment sessions I feel completely healed . Their treatments of IMS, massage , stretching , electrical contraction machine and an exercise regime has completely made my back 100 % better . Highly recommend Ram and his Partner to my family and friends if they have muscle / joint pain. Thanks MJ Physio for your excellent effective treatment for my lower back injury . I will not hesitate to call on you again if I have another injury.",

During that period I was thinking it will be a lifetime agony, however, with the compassionate and dedicated Concussion management of Khrisna ( she is such an expertise to her profession), the improvement was amazing. Currently, I am starting my gradual back to work and still ongoing physio session and active rehab with Dimuth. MJ physio staffs , from receptionist and all the physiotherapist are so accommodating, nice with good costumer service. Thank you so much for doing a great job.",
