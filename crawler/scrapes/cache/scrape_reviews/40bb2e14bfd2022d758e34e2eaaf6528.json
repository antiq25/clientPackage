The food was really delicious, we especially loved the lamb and the chicken style mushrooms. Really recommend trying a bit of everything, we had about 7 dishes for 3 people and then 2 desserts. That was the perfect amount of food.",

            "review_text": "ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. This restaurant really deserves more than one Michelin star! My family went there for dinner and the service, ambience, and food was perfect. Our waiter Lucas was so friendly and very attentive, and he made sure we were content at all times. I really loved the ambience and the environment. My family ordered ALL of the dishes (including all the starters, mains, and dessert, except for the specials) and everything was literally flawless. The dishes came out super fast, and the texture, flavourless, and display of the dishes was perfection. I could not pick out a single imperfection in any dish! I recommend everything, but especially the Chicken Fried Mitake, Summer s Bounty, Summer Bean Salad, BBQ Pork Collar, and Summer Strawberry dessert. The cost is also way more affordable than other Michelins, and the portions are larger than other restaurants. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. We will definitely be coming here again!!!",

            "review_text": "Amazing experience. The food was very flavourful and the service was exceptional. I would recommend the Fried Buttermilk Mushroom. Looks like chicken and taste great! We had two plates of them. The duck with foie gras was amazing and well seasoned. The hay dessert was a big surprise with the complexity of flavours from the first bite. It was delicious. But, I think it could benefit being a smaller serving as by the end of the entire desert portion my palate felt fatigued and it had a bit of a diminishing return on the experience. Still great though! I would come back again!",

            "review_text": "We had an extraordinary experience dining at Published on Main. Everything from the food, to the service, and the atmosphere made it obvious why this restaurant earned a Michelin Star. The standout dish to me was the octopus. This dish had a nice tang to it, and the octopus was tender and bursting with flavour. The ingredients for all dishes were nice and fresh. Particularly, the tomatoes used in the ravioli tasted homegrown - a taste unique to only the highest quality tomato. Overall, I would describe the flavour notes of our dishes to be zesty citrus. One minor thing that stuck out to me was the plating of the pork collar dish. I found it a little awkward that the pork was only on one-third of such a large plate. It looked like most of the dish was missing. Other than that, our experience at Published on Main was fantastic!",

            "review_text": "I was eager to try the food at Published on Main after it received a myriad of accolades over the last couple of years (including its Michelin star). The food, overall, was great but a few were true standouts. The bee pollen milk buns were little pieces of heaven! The morel ravioli was the best stuffed pasta I have ever had. Just incredible. Order the pasta, you wont regret it! Service was, as is expected of an establishment of this calibre, impeccable but perhaps for that very reason the restaurant did feel a bit stuffy.",

It totally lived up to the hype. Though every dish was fantastic, if I had to point out one standout dish, it would be the wagyu carpaccio, which was a special. The aebleskiver, a mainstay on their menu, was also incredible. It surprised me with how flavourful it is. Many of the dishes had some sauce plated with them, which took them to the next level. Perhaps most surprising of all was how it didnt completely break the bank; it was about $115 per person. I was also stuffed by the end.",

Service was very informative and attentive, the restaurant intimately lit and clean, the food amazing. We were a large group and shared a lot of dishes, I dont remember the exact names but we tried mulitple orders of- the pasta with mushrooms and kimchi, schnitzel, fried mushrooms, milk buns, burrata, squash, chips and dip, and aebleskiver(?). The pasta was very flavorful and melded together so nicely- the mushrooms were tender and the sauce.. I could drink it! I loved the aebleskiver, which was a savory herb donut that tasted like a mcd big-mac to me, it had very similar flavors and was very substantial. The schitzel, a very good large portion and crispy. The chips and dip had fish in it but it was mellowed nicely and it tasted like sour cream and onion. For dessert we got some sort of coffee mousse, which was amazing. Looking forward to coming back in the future and trying more dishes!!",

The daily special of the Maitaki gnocchi was our favourite. The balance of acidity, buttery creaminess and the soft pillowy gnocchi with a slight pan fried char was excellent. We (including my Italian husband) didnt think the dish needed the corn, but still, delicious. Service was attentive, and we requested for things to speed up in pace a bit as we had a three hour drive home after. They very much honoured our request, and did a good job not rushing us through but offering everything as we meandered through each course. We didnt have time for the tasting/didnt book enough in advance for it to be available, but would absolutely come back to give it a try if we ever find ourselves back in Vancouver.",

            "review_text": "Dining in Michelin star restaurants isnt something that I aim to do, but Published on Main happened to be on my radar since before they were awarded the coveted Michelin star. I dont really agree with a lot of the stars and recommendations that were made by the Michelin guide, but in the case of Published on Main, they truly do deserve the Michelin star. We were blown away by the flavors, presentation, innovative use of ingredients and exceptional customer service that we received. Featured here: Bee Pollen Milk Buns Torched Hiramasa Summer Bounty Pacific Octopus Lobster Mushroom Lasagna Chips & Dip Wagyu Beef Carpaccio Burrata Side Stripe Prawns Roasted Zucchini Cappelletti Coffee Charred Milk Ice Cream Hay We tried so many wonderful dishes but here are a few highlights: Chips & Dip: I didnt partake in this as there was a beef fat powder in it, but the meat eaters reported that this dish was phenomenal. It was creamy, with a very delicate fish flavor which was brightened with fresh dill. Roasted Zucchini: Slightly crunchy, with a hint of spice. When I inquired as to what the crunchy ingredient was, I was told that the kitchen called it crunchy cheese business! Summer Bounty: The winning dish of the evening! It had a creamy, smoky, charred flavor and a supremely tasty sauce with pecans in it. Hay: This dessert was mind blowing. Hay isnt something I would have ever thought of eating or working with in a kitchen; yet somehow they used it to make an incredibly beautiful and tasty dessert! It seemed to us that the restaurant had been quite deliberate with the order in which the dishes were served, as it seemed like the earlier dishes were more subtle in flavor and that the flavors gradually became more pronounced with subsequent dishes. We reserved about 3 months in advance and at the time that I made our reservation, I had been asked whether there were any dietary restrictions within our group. As Im Pescatarian, I made a point of mentioning that. Three months later I forgot that Id sent that information to the restaurant. The restaurant however, did not forget. We were all extremely impressed with the lengths they went to, to ensure that the food served that night would meet with my dietary restrictions. Our server brought us a hard copy of the menu and marked the dishes that were Pescatarian for me. As I also have a huge aversion to cilantro, he had also marked the dishes that had cilantro in them for me. Even when a different server was sent to our table, we found that she too had been made aware of my dietary restrictions and was very knowledgeable about which dishes contained ingredients that might not work for my diet. Also, Im someone who likes to drink a lot of hot water with my meals and I always watch for how often a server comes around to offer me more hot water. Our server at Published on Main came around several times during the evening to give me more hot water, so I was very happy with this as weve been to other upscale restaurants where they failed to refill my hot water and  I left feeling quite thirsty after our dinner. A truly remarkable restaurant, worthy of their Michelin star status. Highly recommend this place! Service:  Good Parking: Paid parking on the street. Location: 3593 Main St., Vancouver",

The Chocolate and the Charred milk were both wonderful. Not overly sweet with a nice crunch. Super great service from all the staff. One of my favourite places to dine in Vancouver.",

Dining room is immaculately designed and furnished for a laid back but polished atmosphere. I like that the music level is just right - not too loud and just enough for the background. There is no TV which is a great + for me. Came here as a group of 4 and what impressed me apart from the amazing taste of food is the pace of food. The waitress and kitchen really nailed the timing. We didn t feel rushed and there was also no big pause in between each plate. The food menu is very unique and diverse. A couple of different twist to European dish. Overall all very polished - personally I found that the entre meal the least impressive. It was still very good but it is not different to other fine dining places. Appetizers were my highlight because of how unique the dishes were - you definitely cannot find this elsewhere in Vancouver. Overall for its quality, the meal was modestly priced. Highly recommend to try their cocktail list as well which is also very polished and high quality.",

Published uses a small plate, family style arrangement. 5 shared courses + dessert is sufficient for two adults, 6 if you are really hungry. The food relies on exquisite sauces, rather than strong seasonings such as onions and garlic. The presentation of each dish is beautiful. The service is friendly, helpful and prompt. The overall experience is right up there, matched only by a very few other Vancouver restaurants. All this quality does come at a price, as one might expect.

Published on Main was on our last night, and it was a great way to conclude a 25th wedding anniversary trip. We had a lot of great dishes over four days, and PoM had some of our clear favorites.  My wife LOVED the BBQ pork collar. Im a little embarrassed to say I was impressed with the burrata - their version twisted, tweaked, and reinvented something they places have been serving for a long time.  Id also come back and just order the beef crudo again.  It was incredible. (Note - we also tried the bee pollen mik buns.  Dont get me wrong, they were delicious. Theyre fancy, glazed Hawaiin rolls with salt.  Save some room, go out on a limb, and try something in / out of your comfort zone. Itll be worth it) This was the only restaurant where we ordered desert.  My wife preferred to find a gelato place on other nights.  Their Chocolate dish came recommended, and it did not disappoint. If we were told we could only go back to one of the four restaurants we tried for dinner when we visited Vancouver, Published on Main would get the nod.",

This time we had: - fresh cheese with preserved summer berries, black currant leaf oil (number 1 fave) - japanese style milk buns with bee pollen and whipped butter (good as usual) -  freshly foraged mushrooms (special of the day) -  bison tartare -  octopus -  roasted bc halibut in a turbo egg yolk sauce with crispy cropthorn beans - chicken schnitzel with cafe au lait sauce and a bauernhof condiment -  roasted lamb loin with a morel scouse, spring legumes, and sweet onion (perfect) - aerated hay custard with green apple and chamomile (interesting) -  charred milk ice cream with raspberry disks and rye cake - nitro espresso martini and adrian Highly recommend Published on Main!",

From the affable staff, to the menu, to the decor and comfy seating, not a miss at Published was found. As I have some food allergies, I was very impressed by the written menu with all items left available to me they handed me when I sat for dinner. They also called ahead for questions regarding details, which was incredibly thoughtful and considerate. It put me at ease and allowed me to focus on everything they have to offer. The cauliflower, lamb two ways and short rib were exquisite. The drinks were also brimming with creativity. The non-alcoholic mushroom soda was a particular delight. As a Michelin star restaurant now, expectations are high but prices were quite reasonable, and expectations were exceeded. This location deserves to be top of the list if youre planning a special occasion. Youll understand what I mean as soon as you walk through the door. 10/10. Will be back, again.",

Ambiance: The space was dark and intimate, making it a great choice for a special occasion. The only downside was that it can get slightly crowded when fully booked, but it s not too noisy and overall experience won t be affected. Price: The price of the tasting menu was also very reasonable. Before it was awarded a Michelin star, the 12-course tasting menu was only 125 CAD, and even now it is only 150 CAD. This is a great value compared to prices for similar dining experiences in the United States. Food (Summer 2022 menu) The courses were well-prepared, with a focus on using seasonal and locally sourced ingredients from British Columbia. The restaurant also demonstrated great technique in incorporating fermented ingredients, which added depth and complexity to the flavors. While none of the courses particularly stood out as being especially memorable, the overall execution was impressive and each course was interesting enough. The wine pairing was A LOT. I was a bit overwhelmed with the amount of drinks. Overall, I recommend the tasting menu here. As I think it has an opportunity to compete with some of the other restaurants in the US. At 150CAD, it definitely worth a visit!",

The food was superb and artfully presented, all deserving of the various awards given to this restaurant. The atmosphere was also quite fun and vibrant, where we were sitting at the bar, thus getting to watch the preparation of many cool cocktails, of which we tried a couple (which were fantastic). As mentioned, the experience is a fun and vibrant scene, but with fantastic food, which is exactly what we were looking for. Of course, there are fancy high end restaurants with a fine dining experience, where the focus is entirely on the food, but this place seems to hit the mark with atmosphere, food, and service, if you are wanting a fun night out. We absolutely loved it! Highly recommend.",

And the food - The food was visually stunning, and every flavor was ON POINT. It is simply delicious from start to finish. Dishes are designed to be shared and tasted by all, and honestly, we tried many of them. You cant go wrong with anything they offer. The Chef is a master of his craft, and the front of house staff were ALL fantastic and friendly. Thank you for a very special dinner. I cannot wait to come back for another amazing experience!",

            "review_text": "Their menu changes every few months so some of the dishes I mentioned may not be available anymore. Everyone seems to order the milk buns here but honestly I thought they were kind of underwhelming. It s similar to some of the bread/pastries you can buy in Asian bakeries. I enjoyed the Chips & Dip appetizer though because the dip was delicious. We went here earlier this year and I loved the squash appetizer and chicken fried maitake. Last year, I had their Roast duck with seared Foie Gras and their Mascarpone & Corn Cappalletti and enjoyed it so much. Unfortunately, they werent available anymore when I went again this year. My favourite here is their dessert called Hay. Its the one dish that I will keep coming back for. Since getting their Michelin star rating though, I think the service has actually gone down. The last time I came here, our food took so long and it was so hard to flag our server. I guess its because theyre much busier than ever too. So just be prepared to wait a while for your dishes, especially on weekends. Despite the service we had during my last visit, I still highly recommend this restaurant. I enjoyed my first visit here so much that I hope my last visit was just an outlier. Their dishes are just so creative and well thought out. Definitely a must-try restaurant.",

Our server, Lucas, was very nice to us and we loved how proactive he was as he asked if we had any allergies and was interactive throughout the meal. He was also great at promoting the dishes while being honest and genuine. The food was amazing too (except for a few dishes). Hay was by far our favourite dessert. We did not expect much from it, but we devoured the whole thing once it arrived. The caviar and waffles was also amazingly made. It was so soft and delicious   The pollen bread was also so soft and yummy! I would definitely get that again. The only disappointment was the octopus dish as it was a bit too sour and salty. Some of the other dishes were wonderfully done, but it just did not fit our tastebuds. Overall, fantastic restaurant",

The quality of the food is unbelievable - my favourites are the scallops and prawns. The meat was so smooth and had a hint of sweetness - the subtle flavours were mind blowing. We had their tasting menu with wine pairing, both were phenomenal. The wine pairing complimented the dishes really well , 11 courses with 10 wine pairings which was a lot of alcohol but I didn t feel uncomfortable at all after drinking all the wine (I usually wake up with a headache if I drink too much the night before). It says a lot about their sommelier. The vibe is modern and chill. The service was amazing - truly one of the best I ve ever experienced. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to give it a try - date night, friends dinner, business chats - no matter what the occasion, you ll have a good time. I can t wait to return!",

            "review_text": "I visited Published for the second time yesterday, this time for the tasting menu experience rather than the a la carte approach I took for my first visit. I loved my a la carte visit, but I felt compelled to update my review because of the experience I had with the tasting menu. I cant stress enough how sublime the tasting menu was, and how it is unequivocally the best way to experience this restaurant. The 10 courses take you on what I can only describe as a culinary odyssey of consistently mind-blowing flavour and creativity. Every course is unique, delectable, and worthwhile in its own way. The snack smorgasbord that opens the tasting menu is a brilliant start, and the trio of the beef shank broth, the side stripe shrimp, and hiramasa serves as a fairly delicate yet exceptionally flavourful lead up into the menus three savory courses. Those savory courses hit HARD - the sablefish, ravioli, and duck are mind-blowingly rich and exceptionally delicious while never feeling heavy or overwhelming. The burnost tart was a charming transition into the two desert courses, with the douglas fir malt crumb (seriously, who is this creative??) being a profoundly satisfying finish. You can really taste the thought and care that went into not only the individual recipes, but the overall structure of the menu itself and how best to shift from one course to the other. This is art in food form, the best tasting menu Ive ever had, and is as good as fine dining gets in Vancouver. Did I mention the service is exceptional, as well? Or that the wine accompaniment is a journey unto itself? The only thing left to say is that I am greatly looking forward to coming back.",

The service is impeccible- both my friend and I have food sensitivities and the care that was taken by our waitress to explain things to us, check with the kitchen and check in with us, was amazing. Everyone was so friendly and nice, it really made the dining experience that much better. The menu is good with a good number of choices. We were told that around 5 to 6 dishes is what would be recommended for us - we went with 6 which was the perfect amount. I really loved every single dish we ordered but the Squash, Waygu Carpaccio and Roasted Manitoba Pickering really stood out for me. We then had a dessert each and that was really good. I got the Hay and all of it was so tasty except for the apple balls that was buried in the custard - it left a strong after taste that I didnt really enjoy which was a shame as everything else was so good.

A la carte dining for two, we had: - bee pollen milk buns (sweet, soft, and scrumptious buns with a creamy smooth butter - chicken liver mousse (combination of sweet cookie and pumpkin gel with the rich savoury mousse were perfect) - hiramasa (amazingly cured fish and pickled radish. The red beet was quite bitter, though) - fresh cheese (fluffy cheese with a perfectly toasted bun and the bright flavours from the preserved blueberries and strawberries) - duck confit (crisp skin with juicy interior, great combination with the mushrooms and sunchoke and parsley puree) - lamb two ways (the braised lamb shank is to die for and pairs well with the tabbouleh salad to cut on the gamey notes. Not a big fan of the roasted lamb loin, but only because the shank was way better) - dessert: coffee mousse with the toffee crisps were a perfect combination of sweet flavours and textures. Paired well with the espresso martini Shoutout to Lucas for the great dinner and drink suggestions!",

The server mentioned that they would have to talk to the chef and will have to push back our next dish. Service was really good and everyone was super friendly. 10/10 would recommend!

Loved the orange wine and my partner is still thinking about the Sake. 10/10 would recommend. The only thing I personally wasn t a fan of was the Douglas fir dessert, just not a flavour for me but enjoyed by my boyfriend. The side striped prawns and torched yellow tail were standouts and the chefs selection of snacks really started the meal on a high note.",

The food is elegant, delicate and smooth. 11 courses tasting menu is a wonderful journey of taste, appetizers are especially wonderful. Not like most of the restaurants in town, Published is a kind of fusion in between North Europe & East Asia, I was told their executive chef is come from Noma - the No 1 restaurant of the world, and that explains everything. Though not every course is perfect (for example, duck breast is a bit dry coz lack of fat, and salty. Same as halibut), its quality still at the top level, considering the fair cost (125 CAD / pax for tasting set), I would say it is the place that you have to try at least once if you are in Canada. It definitely deserves a Michelin star, if not 2 or 3. The tasting set definitely needs a reservation, which seems not easy now - I dont think it will be available in 2 months. But you can try walk-in for a la carte, usually there will be more seats around 8pm.",

The food was very complex and creative, yet all the dishes were very approachable, and more importantly to me (with a laymans palette) i could tell what each individual flavour and texture was while appreciating their combination. The decor was unfussy, and our server was fantastic, going so far to accomodate our somewhat accelerated schedule for the tasting menu (we had a young screaming infant waiting for us at home), without us feeling pressured. Service was kind, courteous, and thoughtful. Very deserving of its Michelin star, and should probably have a second. Simply the best food experience I have had in Vancouver (and probably Canada).",

We both enjoyed the tasting menu thoroughly. Both our waiting staff (Katie) and sommelier (Michael) were very friendly and knowledgeable, without being snobbish. The setting was beautiful setting and we liked that it still had the West Coast casual vibe for such an amazing culinary experience. The food was all tasty. Some of the highlights include the first course of the first course of a selection of canapes, beef shank (amazing broth!), pickerel (my first taste) with koji butter sauce, and the beef with rosti and mushroom. The cassis sorbet dessert was spectacular!  Was not crazy about the last course of Douglas Fir malt crumble, so I felt it didnt finish strong. I agree with the earlier review that it was a little off putting that they were trying to sell the additional options, without informing you of the price. I think that part can be improved to make it a more pleasant experience. Nevertheless, I would come back again and recommend it.",

The flavours in both pastas were incredible! The appetizers all pleasantly surprised me too. The drink was tasty but definitely my least favourite of the night. The atmosphere is very modern and sophisticated. It definitely gave me New York vibes. The 2 hour dining limit is enforced here ~ we wanted to order dessert but were told we couldn t because we had used up the two hours. I totally understand as this place is always booked and busy and it is nice they take reservations (as a lot of places don t) and can seat you on time. Another excuse to come back to try the dessert! They did however bring two delicious sweets with the bill. This restaurant is high-end and I m definitely a frugal person but this place was definitely worth the splurge.",

They also have patio seating if you want. The food was very interesting with complex flavor. I got the milky bun, fried mushroom, ox tongue and their special mushroom toast. I liked the ox tongue the most as the pickled veggies goes really well with the beef. The mustard added compliments them as well. The special mushroom toast has a really good texture. The dessert wild berry sorbet contains olive oil! It was so interesting and I liked the flavor a lot. Overall it was really good but I feel like there isnt that many options for brunch.",

My personal favourites were the pickerel and the ricotta manti, but every dish was tasty and memorable. Some of the dishes even grew on me as the flavours developed over several bites. I d also like to highlight our server Lucas in particular, as he did everything he could service-wise to make our experience amazing. My wife was feeling a bit under the weather, and he checked in regularly, preemptively offered hot water and to pack some of my wife s dishes as her stomach was too unsettled to eat. Sincere thanks again to Lucas for your efforts and kindness, and for expediting our dishes so that we could leave a little more quickly to rest at home after as well. We will definitely be back in the future to hopefully enjoy the delicious options available again, together next time!",
