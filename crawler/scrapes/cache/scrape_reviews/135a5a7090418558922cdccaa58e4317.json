            "review_text": "Bin 4 Burger Lounge (2996 Granville St., Vancouver) I recently had the pleasure of dining at Bin 4 Burger Lounge located on Granville Street in Vancouver, and I must say that it was a delightful experience. This trendy and cozy restaurant specializes in crafting gourmet burgers with a unique twist, and it certainly lived up to its reputation. First and foremost, the ambiance of Bin 4 Burger Lounge was inviting and contemporary. The interior was tastefully decorated with a combination of rustic and modern elements, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The seating arrangements were comfortable, and the staff was attentive and friendly, providing prompt service throughout my visit. Now lets talk about the star of the show the burgers. Bin 4 Burger Lounge offers an extensive selection of burgers, each with its own distinct flavor profile. From classic beef burgers to inventive vegetarian options, there is something to satisfy every palate. I opted for their signature Bin 4 Burger, and it did not disappoint. The patty was juicy, perfectly cooked, and seasoned to perfection. The toppings were fresh, and the brioche bun was soft and complemented the burger beautifully. The portion sizes were generous, ensuring that I left feeling completely satisfied. In addition to their impressive burger menu, Bin 4 Burger Lounge also offers a variety of tasty sides and appetizers. Their truffle Parmesan fries were a standout, with a delightful combination of flavors that elevated the dining experience. The restaurant also boasts a selection of craft beers and cocktails to complement the meal, adding another layer of enjoyment. While the overall dining experience at Bin 4 Burger Lounge was excellent, there were a few minor areas where improvements could be made. Firstly, the wait times during peak hours can be a bit long, so its advisable to make a reservation or plan your visit accordingly. Secondly, the pricing is slightly on the higher side, especially when considering the add-ons and sides. However, the quality of the ingredients and the exceptional flavors justify the price to a large extent. In conclusion, Bin 4 Burger Lounge is a must-visit spot for burger enthusiasts in Vancouver. With its inviting atmosphere, flavorful burgers, and attentive service, it delivers a memorable dining experience. While it may be a bit pricey, the quality and taste of the food make it worth the investment. I will definitely be returning to Bin 4 Burger Lounge for another mouthwatering burger adventure in the future. Our server was Jessi, and he is very friendly and his service was superb. Parking: It s on the back side of the restaurant",

The burger I ordered was amazing. I love how it looked exactly how it did in the picture. It was also a huge burger that I was able to eat only half of it and had to take the rest home. I ordered the Lob It To Me Burger which had lobster, goat cheese and truffle aioli. It was delicious. Im definitely bringing my family here next time.",

However, the fries were not crispy and were a bit too soft and soggy for my taste. They offer a variety of burgers made from chicken, vegan, beef, fish, and bison, with numerous flavors to choose from, and the overall quality of the food was excellent. The seating was comfortable, making it a great place to hang out. They offer a fantastic late-night special after 9 pm, where you can order any burger with fries or salad for only $11, along with a non-alcoholic drink. Excellent servive by the servers.",

Got the big dipper, decent burger, however its difficult to differentiate if its Wagyu or not, but nonetheless a good burger. I would like to say they have great sauces so go try them out when you get the chance. Surprisingly, my favourite thing I had there was the strawberry goat cheese salad, it was probably the best tasting thing in my opinion that came as an upgrade side to the burger.",

The Bin 4 Burger is made with a juicy, perfectly cooked beef patty that was seasoned to perfection. The burger was topped with crispy bacon, melted cheddar cheese, fresh avocado, and a tangy aioli sauce. The combination of flavors and textures was outstanding - every bite was bursting with deliciousness. Overall, I would highly recommend Bin 4 Burger Lounge for anyone looking for a delicious and satisfying meal.

They have a wide range on the menu and therell be something that will for sure catch your eye. The kitchen is very efficient and very quick at getting your food out. However, this place does get busy in the evenings and weekends so budget your time. They have a very well priced menu. Old: The burgers are really good. The fries are okey nothing special. The onion rings are not so good, they do use red onions for the onion rings but it does not improve the flavor. Service was good again nothing special.

The truffle burger is a must try for truffle lover. The burger is really juicy and tasty. I would suggest adding dill to fried pickles so there would be a difference between the batter used for Onion ring and the batter for the pickles. That was just an opinion. All in all this restaurant is a gem and the experience and service are fabulous. Did I mention the happy hour?",

            "review_text": "Bin 4 has some great burgers. The burgers here arent so typical, they play around and try to create interesting flavors. I didnt get to try just a normal burger here, so I have no idea how they stack up for a purist, but the burgers we tried were really great. I tried the Minted Lamb burger and it was so delicious. The blue cheese stood out, but the eggplant and tomato relish brought some great sweetness that combined so well with the lamb. I would eat this burger again in a heart beat. My dining mates had the Big Dipper (a play on a beef dip, but with a burger) and the Bistro (a chicken, brie and bacon burger). Both were well received! Bin 4 lets you have your choice of aioli for dipping (normally for fries, but theyll still give it to you with a salad!) and it was so fun to try them out. Also, the happy hour is incredible. All their single cocktails are 5$, so we each tried one and Id love to come again and try more. Sorry for the unimpressive photos! It was very bright out and hard to get them to be not overexposed.",

            "review_text": "Spontaneous choice results in one of the best burgers I have ever eaten! Normally when we eat out, we review the place we go in order to get the value out of quantity, quality, service and atmosphere. Bin 4 Burger Lounge did not disappoint, despite being a spontaneous choice with little if any review. We were greeted by a friendly staff and sat down on their patio, where a brief review of the specials and happy hour drinks, which was followed by what was included in the regular menu choices and what was extras or up-scaling. After receiving our drinks and complementary home made chips (or crisps) we ordered a Black and Blue burger with their fires and a Wild Mushroom with up-scaled onion rings, both of which came with our choice of aioli dipping sauce. The Black & Blue with the jalapeno aioli sauce was juicy and topped with fresh tomato and arugula as well as a small mound of sweet red onion relish. All the flavours were distinct and complementary, with each of the described ingredients tasting fresh. The fries, as good as they were, may have been a bit too much for the appetite behind the order, and thus the salads we saw were envied for the refreshment that was desired. You know how it is, who doesnt want fries with it; until youre too full for the last three bites. As for the Wild Mushroom, it too was a delight. I might also add that the bun was PERFECT on both burgers; light and airy with good texture and chew needed to keep everything together until the last bite. The beef patties were also meaty and juicy (dripping down the hand juicy - worthy of an extra napkin) with a nice char reminding us of a great summer bbq.  The toppings were generous and again fresh, especially since I am quite critical to mushroom burgers at other locations where they charge an extra 1.00 for 5 mushroom slices that taste like nothing. THIS burger came with its own mushroom mountain that tasted like they were picked, sliced and sauteed 5 minutes ago. I dont need to say much about their onion rings because if you look at others photos, you will notice consistency of complete and utter yumminess. The pictures do not lie, they redefine what an onion ring should be. And the aioli sauces . . . I am desiring to taste them all. The jalapeno dip was different enough from the bacon aioli that I could not decide which of the two I liked the best. If I had any complaint, it would have to be with the tomato garnish. This is not a complaint against Bin 4, since we are all subject to what the tomato farmers give us out of their greenhouses. Where have all the tomatoes from my childhood gone? They tasted like tomatoes! All in all, this was a delight and a gem to remember! I am glad we can still be spontaneous and still feel rewarded for the choices we make.",

This place has broadened options. When you get a side of salad instead of fries, you get a generous portion which will fill you. You also get premium sauce with your burger which is great.

I ordered the turkey burger with goat cheese, butter lettuce, peach jalapeno chutney, and balsamic aioli and it was amazing. The burger is served on a brioche bun (is there any other kind of bun thats an acceptable option for a gourmet burger?) with your choice of fries, a salad, or potato chips. I opted for the salad and it was flavourful with a lemon champagne honey vinaigrette, red peppers, and pumpkin seeds on a bed of artisan greens. A Blue Buck beer was a great complement to the meal.

            "review_text": "They have recently upped the price of late night starting at 9PM from around $10 per burger to 50% whatever burger you choose. Its fair, considering there is a huge price gap between some of the vegetarian burgers and the much-coveted bison burger. FOOD: Always delicious. I would recommend staying away from the half-and-half option for combos as the portions for each come out to be smaller than if you just got a full order of either fries or salad. I went with my friend who rarely eats salads because of venomous hatred but he actually complimented the salad, which says something. DRINK: Lots of creative drink options but no free refills. During late night, you get 50% off a burger only if you purchase a drink so Ive ordered one religiously since coming. Some, like their Raspberry Lemon Fizz, are a miss. INTERIOR: So cozy that you will be tempted to nap inside. The music and kitchen noises arent too loud, plus with the ambient lighting and plush seats and sofas you may feel your eyelids droop every time. SERVICE: Always professional and prompt :)",
