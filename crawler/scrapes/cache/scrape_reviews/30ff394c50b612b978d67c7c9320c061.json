The restaurant is small and the servers, albeit being friendly, were not the most accommodating. We asked for crushed peanuts for our papaya salad and they gave us a mere half a teaspoon. The other times we ate here before, they have served peanuts with the papaya salad, which is how we prefer it. We would be ok if get charged extra for this too. Our friend also ordered Thai coffee which came with ice and we asked if we could get another one but with no ice, and they said no   For this reason, I m rating their service a 3/5 despite their politeness. But I d go back for the food in a heartbeat!",

You all ordered papaya salad. And your boyfriend has asked for peanuts for it but in the recipe we dont have it on the menu. which we have given You go for a small cup of peanuts. and you have asked for more which we have refused Because it is something that is not in the recipe. 2. For iced coffee The shop is sure that we can make iced coffee without ice. But that day you asked us to make hot coffee for you. It wasnt on the menu so we declined. However, I think there has been a misunderstanding in this communication. and the shop would like to inform you that In fact, the shop has announced that they will do take out only from September 5th. Thank you very much.",

It s a tad expensive but it was a great portion size and came out fairly fast. Service was great - very fast and responsive. It s a little hole in the wall, and better to take to go.",

            "review_text": "One of the best Thai restaurants Ive been to so far. We ordered the Pad Si Ew Moo Grob (rice sheet noodles with crispy pork) and Chuchi Pla Tod (creamy coconut curry with crispy basa fillets). Both were so much more flavourful than I expected, and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and presentation. The basa fillets and pork were perfectly crispy. Id definitely recommend both dishes, though if I had to pick a must-try item, itd be the Chuchi Pla Tod for sure. The place is small with little seating and an open kitchen. I came in the summer and there wasnt much foot traffic, so sitting outside was actually enjoyable. The waitress came out to check in on us quite often (most of their customers seem to sit outside) and refilled our water frequently. Its about $25-$35 per person, which is on the higher end of price, but was so worth it for the food, quantity was decent too. I would definitely recommend and will be back myself to show this place to other friends.",

Take out only, but everything is packaged very well to go - for my Chuchi Pla Tod had the fish, curry, and rice/veggies all packaged separately so everything was as fresh as possible when I got home to eat it and nothing was soggy. The Pad See Ew is also a favourite - chewy noodles, great flavour. The roti is on the sweeter side, I think its better as a dessert (with condensed milk) than an appetizer (with curry). There are a couple of tables outside to sit at, but its limited, so best to take the food to-go. Cant wait to try more dishes!",

I was floored by the punch of flavors and the quality of its ingredients, from the broth to the mushrooms to the eggs, everything was perfect.

The smell of the cooking is divine, since the seats are adjacent to the kitchen. Most people grab takeout rather than dine in. Our food was served in takeout containers even though we dined in, but Im not sure if that was due to their recent return to dine in service or because we sat down late in the evening. Theyve got a great menu selection that has more unique dishes than some other Thai places, such as the Pad Ki Mao dishes, which use a chewy, clear, and wider rice sheet noodle that has a great bounce on the teeth.",

For mains, we got the green prawn curry which blue my mind and then tofu pad Thai. You need to come here as soon as possible. It is the same quality as Maenam, just with a more classic Thai cuisine.

The pork salad was incredibly delicious, so were the pad-kee-mao plates. Fantastic food!! We were a group of 7 and werent great fans of sitting out on the street side tables, so well just do take-out next time. But the food surely made up for the seating inconvenience.",

The sweet, citrusy, creamy, fresh combination is a delight on the palate. The Jumbo prawns were perfectly cooked. One of the best in the city. Thai green Curry: Flavours unfold slowly on the palate until you are hit by chili/pepper spices. The green curry is everything I expected: Creamy spicy,flavourful.... thank you for the real thai basil...what a difference. This is such a gem in the city (especially this part of the city). Happy to call you guys neighbours! cant wait to share this place with friends and family. Cheers!",

Probably as crunchy as Phnom Penh. Curry Roti $5.99 - the roti is very crunchy although a bit hard. Wish it be crunchy on the layers it soft on the inside. Not sure if it s cuz it got cold. Chicken curry noodle $17.99 - Probably my favourite dish. The rich creamy curry sauce went so well with the egg noodle. The chicken was quite tender too. Pad si ew chicken $14.99 - The glass sheet noodles are so chewy and it s also very flavorful but not overpowered by MSG! Thai iced tea $3.99 - Can be a bit stronger with the tea base but I like how it s not overly sweet. Maybe cause the ice melted and diluted it a bit. This place would be crazy yummy if dine-in opens!",

The owners always greets us so warmly when we arrive. Since we knew of their existence, we couldnt stop ordering take out from them! Is once or even at times, twice a week, too much? Needless to say, they have hands down one of the best chicken wings I have ever eaten. Crispy, perfectly seasoned and the sauce that comes with it.....drooool...... great...now I want some. We have also tried their pad thai with shrimp! Delicious! I do prefer the shrimp pad thai over their crispy pork pad thai though. The other night, they had a daily special on their menu called Tom Zap, which is a hot and sour pork rib soup with a side of rice. I literally had tears in my eyes at the first sip. It was honestly so perfectly executed in the balance between sour and spice, plus, it was packed full of perfectly tender pork ribs that fell off the bone. If you happen to be in the neighbourhood, dont pass by this place without trying something on  their menu! Ask if they have any daily specials too :) Reasonably priced, great portion of food, wonderful service, authentic flavors, open until 10 PM everyday.",
