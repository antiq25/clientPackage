Also, I think they control the customer flow very well, even though they are busy, but the speed of serving food is acceptable to me. I didn t neglect the food quality just because they were busy. Highly recommend the waffle with White chocolate sauce!",

I immensely enjoyed the Fricassee  Champignons [2 sunny eggs served atop cremini & blue oyster mushrooms, king oyster mushrooms, roasted potatoes, mushroom demi glace, chevre (cheese made from goats milk), arugula & grilled focaccia]. Even though Im not a vegetarian, I have to say: Wow, what a delicious treat! And our server was super efficient & professional.

With an old-fashioned interieur reminiscent of the Belle Epoque and a modern menu, it by far exceeds the usual burger/meat heavy American breakfast restaurants you can find in larger US or Canadian cities. However, the portions are not too large, and yet the Avocado toast was delicious. The Granola was surprisingly tasteful, all fruit freshly prepared and the yoghurt tasteful. The Latte was just on-point, the Americano a little weak. The personnel is very friendly, while the short-skirt policy seems out of place and outdated. Reservations are recommended since it gets busy in the morning.

            "review_text": "Cafe Medina is a legit Michelin reviewed cafe with amazing and inventive breakfast and brunch. First, the coffee is outstanding living up to their credo  life to short to drink bad coffee.  The variety on the menu is amazing.  Their are traditional offerings all the way to a paella style skillet. I had the frittata of the day which was beef and potatoes.  The eggs were so fluffy and light they almost defied gravity.  The beef was well seasoned and not overly present.  We also had a special waffle with milk chocolate sauce and it did not disappoint.  There is an interesting Mediterranean flair to the brunch menu that we did not try.  Highly recco a stop here for brunch but know that you may have to wait a bit .",

Luckily the weather was good and we got a spot at the patio. The food is spectacular to get you a well balanced meal. I loved my paella, loads of flavor and veggies to start off my day! The waffle was also very soft and not overly sweet so you can choose how much sauce youd like to dip for yourself. The service was really great too, prompt and friendly and the entire staff considerate all around. Well deserved popularity and Id love to try more of their menu if I get the chance!",

Phil (One of the staff) suggested us caramel waffles and breakfast, we placed order exactly the same as Phil suggested us: caramel waffles for 2 times!. Phil is a very respectful person with nice voice, he has 10 star review.Definitely, I will come back again here.Jenna has a smile on her face, she is very polite and welcomed us very warmly; If I could give her ten stars, I would. I would like to update my review for my recent visit at this restaurant in July 10,2023. This afternoon, I welcomed very warmly to Cafe Medina by Charlotte (host), she is very kind and friendly lady, she seated us very quickly. Gui explained us menu in detail so that facilitated us to choose the right option in menu: Fricassee was the food that we choose. I attached a photo of Fricassee (Last Photo). Fricassee is made of braised short ribs, roasted potatoes, smoked cheddar, grilled focaccia and caramelized onions, the food was very delicious. Beautiful Aisling served us on time with smile face and in a respectful way, she is a very helpful and hardworking in serving us, she is one of the talented staff in the restaurant. In fact, I give the 5 star to all of them because of their hospitality, respectful behaviour and good advise in finding best food that match your interest. I strongly recommend this restaurant.",

It was a full house during a weekday so I would definitely recommend a reservation unless you are fine with waiting an hour plus. My husband and I ordered a few things which were all delicious! 1. Latte-  loved that they put it in a small glass cup. It was really yummy and something I would order again. 2. Paella without chorizo- this was delicious. Beautiful flavors of the vegetables mixed with the orzo and a hint of lemon. I ordered the egg on the side scrambled. 3.Frittata- roasted vegetables mixed with the lightest fluffiest eggs Ive ever had. Came with a side of greens and focaccia. Both were amazing as well. 4. Roasted potatoes with lemon aioli- sooo good. I love potatoes and these hit the spot. They were not the traditional crispy breakfast potatoes. These were soft with like a light balsamic glaze and cheddar. The lemon aioli was also very good. Definitely nothing like Ive had before. 5. Liege style waffle with White Chocolate Pistachio Rosewater sauce- The waffle was really soft and sweet. The sauce for me was a miss. I thought it tasted like condensed milk. I would 100% come back here to try the different menu options! Vegetarian options: Many of the menu items can be vegetarian!",

You also have the choice of adding toppings for $1.50, which I think is worth it. The mixed berry compote and the milk chocolate lavender pair so nice with the waffles, but Im sure any of the other toppings are just as tasty :)",

My husband had the Harissa burger. It was all delicious.  Our server was friendly and helpful. I didn t quite understand why it took so long for the waffles to be served.  They came several minutes after the other food and they just had to be taken out of the case. Oh well. It didn t ruin the experience.",

My go to us the fricassee which is beautifully prepared in a skillet and features fall apart tender short ribs that are packed full of flavour. If you need a little amuse then the liege waffles are a must have. A selection of sauces blend perfectly with the flavours of the waffle. The service and attention to detail is impeccable and the art of hospitality is grade A. There are multiple touch points to make sure things are right for you but not too much to make it seem like they are hovering. Highly recommend while you can to book a table as lines typically start pre-opening all days of the week. Update.

They dont take reservations, so if you dont want to wait in a long line, I recommend only visiting on weekdays or trying to get there for when they open. The wolfs breakfast is amazing, and I also loved the flat bread. You must try the waffles with some of the amazingly unique sauces they make in house as well. Even though the restaurant is always packed, service has always been excellent as well. Update: recently returned and tried the Le Complet, which was also awesome!
