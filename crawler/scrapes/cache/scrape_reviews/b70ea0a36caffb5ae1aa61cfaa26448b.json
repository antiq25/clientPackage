My lawyer put me in touch with Nichola who came to my home, which was so appreciated and Nichola took care of direct billing ICBC. Nichola has it all. Nichola was excellent at diagnosing my issues (she is a terrific listener) and when it came to doing her magic, each session made significant steps in easing my pains so that I was soon able to walk again. If you are looking for a physiotherapist I recommend you check out Nichola. Shes awesome.",
