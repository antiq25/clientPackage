We commend our server, Arianna, who took the time to take photos for us to celebrate a milestone birthday. Overall, outstanding! Michelin star deserved!

Every bite was perfect and everything just seemed to work well. The cocktails were also delicious and matched well with the dishes. The dessert was fresh and gave a palette cleansing experience - definitely another highlight from an already amazing dinner. If you re worried about being hungry after the tasting menu, you won t be. It definitely will fill you. I don t think you even need to opt for the add ons, but I found it filling. Don t worry about parking either as there is plenty of paid parking in the area. We got lucky and found one right outside the restaurant but cars come and go quite often enough. I would highly recommend coming here, but book well in advance as they fill up quickly.",

The highlights of the meal were the deconstructed lasagna dish which was astonishingly delicious and the torn bread dish. The staff clean the bread crumbs off your table, fold your napkin for you when you step away from the table, and change cutlery after almost every dish. Service feels attentive, but not too intrusive. Some of the staff were a little awkward, but so am I so who am I to complain. This restaurant is certainly worthy of its Michelin star. My only complaint is that the table set up is rather close for a few of the tables. For example, when the staff are having a conversation with the patrons at another table, I regrettably had a butt in my face while I was eating. This is a minor gripe that didn t get in the way of an otherwise great meal. AnnaLena was wonderful, I would come again most certainly as the menu continues to change.",

            "review_text": "Fantastic dinner. We really enjoyed their tasting menu (apparently they are switching the menu very soon, so we hope to return soon), and their service was great. From the photos, I actually wasnt really convinced it would be a nice place to go; the food and interior looked pretty basic to me, but I was wrong. I still feel that they could get more unique looking or interesting plates etc., but their food was  original and they tasted fantastic! It is a pricier restaurant, but its worth it. If you are in the area and would like to try out a great restaurant, I highly recommend this place. One thing I suggest is, there were a couple dishes you were encouraged to eat with your fingers, it would have been nice to have a wet towel or a finger bowl to clean your fingers afterwards. Thank you for a great dinner experience.",

The service was friendly and excellent, the food was fabulous and the atmosphere/ambience  was impeccable. Not kid friendly, although they provide options outside their tasting menu for kids, I would advise against bringing kids. Definitely the place to go with your significant other or a few friends to enjoy a slow non rushed dinner while having intimate conversations. Would definitely come back here. Each of the items in the five course is well balanced in taste with a little bit more on the savoury side (except for dessert). I especially enjoyed the mussels.",

            "review_text": "We first dined here was about two months ago and had a fantastic dinner. To make sure it wasnt just a one-time lucky experience I wanted to try it again before leaving a review. Yesterday, we brought our son and girlfriend here to celebrate his birthday and we werent disappointed. Every course was thoughtfully prepared with every element playing a crucial part of the overall dish. The food was absolutely top notch and the presentation was lovely. Our son had just eaten at his favourite restaurant the night before and came to the conclusion that AnnaLena was now his new favourite! The service was phenomenal. We had Rebekah as our host previously and this time we had Tara. They were both excellent at making us feel welcomed and really enhanced the dining experience with their descriptions of each dish and expansive knowledge of the wine pairings. You can really feel that the staff are passionate about the food and wine and really want you to get the most out of your time here. For me, AnnaLena is my favourite tasting menu restaurant in Vancouver. I love being surprised at what a restaurant decides to present to its diners, and Chef Robbinss use of ingredients, flavours and textures continues to impress. I can hardly wait for my next visit!",

My faves were the trout, tortellini and the duck - the duck was perfectly cooked and so tender. The dessert was just the right sweetness and was the perfect end to the meal. If you re not into alcoholic drinks, the From East End to West End mocktail was refreshing. The service was also great. Highly recommend this restaurant.",

            "review_text": "Update November 13, 2022: When dining at a restaurant, there are generally three things I look for: quality of food, service and ambiance.  There are so many restaurants in Vancouver that have one or more of those things. They might have good food but horrible service. Or they are really nice people but the food is average. There are some places that have ok food, service and ambiance but don t reach the level of excellence. AnnaLena has amazing food, excellent service and a nice ambiance. They are gracious and not pretentious like a few other places in town. And after coming back multiple times throughout the years I know for a fact that they are also consistent. I know that whenever I dine at AnnaLena the experience will be amazing. Food was delicious, cocktails were delicious, I was very satisfied. And the set menu is a relative bargain for a Michelin starred restaurant. The only nitpick I have this time is that they covered their beautiful pasta dish with foam. The pasta underneath is beautiful (based on their IG pics) so it was a shame that we could not see it. Update Nov 21, 2021: Still a great experience! Original Review: One of my favourite restaurants in Vancouver and one I constantly return to. I love their new tasting menu format which means that whenever I go it is a new experience. Regardless of what the food is, the execution is always top notch. Taste and presentation are excellent and it is really good value for the price too. Anna Lena is a must visit restaurant in Vancouver.",

I was going to make another phone call if they didn t have it by now. I would definitely say take the ride if you haven t already. Can t wait to revisit Vancouver again just to revisit this dream. Excellent service, food, and drinks. A complete story that takes your pallet on a once in a life trip.  Please excuse brevity and typos as this review was sent from my smartphone.",

            "review_text": "I come back to this place every month now. This month they have the dine out menu which I think is great. For a bit less price you get the same quality of food. You only lose one pasta course which honestly I dont care about that much. Overall I like their salad course the best, it is almost always my favorite. They use fresh, seasonal ingredients and make them tasty. Other courses are also good. Appetizers are always innovative. This time they had a shaved Foie Gras, it was impressive. Dessert is never too sweet or too big, leaves a refreshing note. My only suggestion for this place is to improve their fish main course. I got fish twice, once it was overcooked and dry, the 2nd time it was kind of flavorless. This time I got the port belly and it was amazing. Didnt taste oily and stinky at all. Service is also very attentive, they always come by to refill my water. Decor is morden, owner really likes KAWS, and have a good taste in music.",

Great progression and portion sizes. Food was beautiful and tasty. Lots of creamy, salty, crunchy, umami flavours. The ahi foie gras and the agnolotti were some favourites. Torn bread was very good. But everything was great. The service was attentive, friendly, and spot on. Anna Lena definitely exceeded all our expectations. One of my new favorite   restaurants. Also the cherry biscuit at the end of the meal. Amazing!!!",

            "review_text": "(For dining sept 2nd) This was the best meal Ive ever had.   Each course was delicious and something I would order a la carte. The service is what really puts this restaurant on another level. The staff are military-like in their timing and precision but not their disposition, as our server had a dry sense of humour that mirrors mine closely. Unfortunately I cant remember her name, but I feel like in another life we could be friends. Its one of the most expensive meals Ive had but worth every penny for this culinary experience. The only aspect of anna lena that is close to a downside would be the acoustics in the building, it was sometimes difficult to hear our server. Also, the cocktails are up there with the best cocktail bars around, very well balanced. Disregard my recommendation at your peril!",

I went last night and it was great. Start to finish, the service was great, the food was creative and most importantly it was delicious. They didn t hold back on their delivery and the small details really brought their dishes together. The only negative is parking can be difficult in the summer because of its proximity to Kits beach.",

The dishes are all meant to be shared, so make sure you ask if youre not sure about the size. We got the torn bread, duck pate, bison tartare, octopus, mussels, and scallops. Definitely an amazing Vancouver meal, with the seafood really shining through. The octopus was my favourite dish, tenderly cooked with a smokey tint, alongside potatoes and horseradish. I was impressed by everything we ordered and would rate this restaurant as one of the best in Vancouver.",

Besides that, the other complaints were: small portions in the tasting menu....i know its a tasting menu but when its so good, is it wrong to want seconds? And where we were seated, close to the corner entrance, my partner kept feeling the breath and could smell the sweat from the fitness goers coming down the stairs from the adjacent Ron Zalko fitness studio. Pick your seat with caution. Big pluses for a great menu, wonderful creative foods, great presentation, lovely dishware, attentive service and big customer service kudos to them for accepting an expired gift certificate with no hesitation. Thats excellent customer service in my books. Oh last critisism: the dessert of cherries with ice cream was anti-climatic and too basic compared to the rest of the intricate preceeding menu.

I think I have come here enough times now to make a proper review! The only downside is the noise level. I went as a party of 4 and could not even hear anyone at the table, nor the server as she was describing the dishes. If you re seated in the booths, the sound echoes on the inside of the arch. Not sure if the group of ladies seated in the other booth were loud, drunk, or just  loud, but we heard their entire conversation all evening. TLDR. Ask for seating by the windows, where it s tucked away for a quieter dining experience. Do not sit at the booths.",

He also made me 3 mocktails which were his creations and not on the menu.  All were fantastic, especially the one which had basil and cucumber. When I asked about the ceramics I was given a page which lists the ceramics makers and some details about them.  Even the paper it was printed on was beautiful. I will come back and dine with my partner next time we come to Vancouver. Also, check out the wall display on the way to the restrooms.  The small lego figures made me smile.

            "review_text": "Excellent tasting menu, which was a selection of dishes (6 courses) from the regular menu in smaller plates. A great way to try a little of everything, but if I were to do it again, I would order from their regular menu. We started with the Oyster, it was fresh, a little spicy (jalapeno mignonette) with shaved foie gras and a great way to start the evening. The next was the greens, which consisted of chickpea panisse and tahini. It was surprisingly delicious! All the flavours balanced well and the miso eggplant on the bottom gave it a great flavour. The next was an amazing mussels in a creamy sauce with mushrooms and a hint of lemongrass. I had every drop, dipping my torn bread to soak up the last bits. Getting to bigger dishes, we had the crunchy buttery fried chicken next and then the best dish of the night, the sablefish. I loved everything about the sablefish. It was served with a base of creamy mashed potatoes, the pickled shitake gave he dish a good kick, but it didnt take away from the fish, which was cooked beautifully, with that crispy skin and flaky meat.  We ended the mains with beef bavette. Only complaints about the meal: the beef was actually the poorest of the dishes that night. Although it was a good dish, that, and the blood orange serbert dessert was a let down from the amazing mussels and sablefish. I would have liked dinner to end stronger, with their best dish. This was almost enough for me to give 4*, but the attentive and friendly service we received throughout the night made up for it. The other complaint is the wait between meals. The couple who came in after us also had a tasting menu. They started while we were on our third course and by the end, they had caught up which tells you we had been waiting a very long time in between courses (especially between the fish and the beef) TL,DR: All in all, a great meal - but skip the tasting menu. Order the greens, mussels and sablefish. The plates are meant to share, family style. AnnaLena is lively, and can get quite noisy. The decor is quite interesting with Kaws bears throughout.",

            "review_text": "Came here to check out  Chapter Sixty Five  of their set tasting menu. Overall, it was a great experience. The food was delicious and the cocktails were great. The A5 wagyu skewers, Hokkaido scallops, garlic torn bread and even the tomato salad with the creamy dill dressing were standouts. Only let down was the glazed cherry and thyme ice cream dessert, but that s only because I m not a big fan of the cherries and the thyme ice cream tasted like a big pile of Cajun chicken. The interior decor was a nice blend of contemporary designs mixed with streetwear culture pieces. Staff were attentive, engaging and friendly. Only other knock is a mixup with the host staff, as there was some confusion. We had checked in, saw that a table for 2 was already set up but we were told that they were still preparing our tables and sent us away, advising us that they would text us when the table was set and to go back later. As we left to walk nearby to kill time, literally within a minute we got a text notifying us that our table was ready - it was the table that we noticed was already set up when we had initially walked in. That little misadventure was pretty unnecessary, but first world problems I suppose. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend checking this place out.",
