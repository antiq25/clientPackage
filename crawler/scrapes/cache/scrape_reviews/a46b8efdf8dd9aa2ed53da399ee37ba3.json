            "review_text": "Ordered the roast lamb and calamari dinner, and both were excellent. The lamb was super tender and well seasoned, and the calamari was lightly battered and fried nicely for a grrat crisp. The Greek potato was delicious, I wish they served two on the plate. The rice pilaf wasnt the best Ive had - couldve used more flavour and unfortunately it was cold. However, the lamb and potato were warm so it was fine to eat with the rice. They also served free pita bread which came out hot and fresh and great with the Tzatziki. Great patio setting, I like that they have the plastic barriers up to separate the tables - it makes it more intimate and quiet. The place was packed on a Saturday night and they only had three servers. Waited about 15 min for a table at 8pm and many people were stopping in for pizza take out. Table service was a bit slow but our service did a great job and was friendly.",

However if youre from the Chicago area or want to catch a glimpse of what that pizza is like and you are craving a traditional pan (pan, not deep dish, huge difference) pizza from the chicago area Id suggest Olympia. The cheese is salty like I miss from home and the dough is crispy but airy just like our pan pizzas. Thank you so much Olympia for giving me a little memory from home. If you order take out finely grate some Parmesan and grab some chili flakes and its the closest to Chicago pizza youll get in Vancouver.",

I thought for that price its probably pretty small and I might not be full, especially since last week I ordered the same thing at another place and it was over $50.  When it showed up I was shocked, it was a nice sized steak, a skewer of prawns, a baked potato with sour cream and butter, a full side of mushrooms and garlic bread, and it was very tasty.  It was significantly bigger than the similar dish I got last week from another restaurant.  The steak from my meal last week might have been slightly better but no where near almost double the money better.  Definitely recommend this place, everything Ive tried at the Kits and Denman locations have not disappointed.",

I eat in if with someone else but if its just me I get  it to go and scarf it down in the privacy of my own place. Dinner doesnt last long. Some garlic bread to get the rest of the meat sauce. Then its time to undo the top button on your pants cause there feeling tight",

Dined in, the owner was so kind and accommodating especially considering we had three small children with us. At the end, the youngest got sick and barfed all over the floor (had nothing to do with the food, he choked on a candy and getting sick was the aftermath). The owner was so kind and compassionate, didnt even bat an eye when I told him. The pizza was awesome! Thick crispy crust, loads of toppings, nothing like the cardboard-like stuff you get from the usual pizza delivery places. Really big portions. The owner gave the birthday boy a complimentary slice of cake for his birthday, bagged up to go. Dont open it until you get home, he said. So kind! Excellent value for dine in. Its not a fancy place at all, but the service outclassed many of the five star $$$$ places Ive dined in in the past. I would definitely go again for the pizza and the welcoming environment.",

It is like the double cheese of any other pizza Ive ever had. I appreciate this place so much. Yeah, some other reviewers have commented the pies are a little greasy, and I guess I can vouche for that, but Id say this is how this style of pizza goes. Especially when it comes with an absolute mountain of cheese that disappears the thickest toppings under a hot ooey-gooey blanket of comatose-inducing casin. Anytime we want to celebrate, this it what we look forward to. Thank you Olympia Pizza & Pasta Restaurant.",

Only 2 times in the couple of decades that we have ordered delivery have we had a mix-up in orders, and to me that is A1 service. As well when they were told about the mix-up, the mistake was remedied, and the owner delivered it personally pipping hot with the knowledge that our next order was on them. Not only are the staff very helpful with the menu, but for the Most part their phone manners very friendly. Personally I have only eaten in the restraunt about a handful of times. If you are hungry for a very tasty and filling delivery order This is the one to order from  in the West End of Vancouver!!!  PS to the owner and staff I will have to come down and meet you personally thanks for many years of keeping my wife and myself satisfied (and sometimes MAX our cat).PPS: what ever cheese blend you use on the pizza it is insanely good.",

The servers were friendly and the service was excellent overall. There is a nice patio outside the restaurant. Reasonable prices. Our kids )9 and 11) usually split an order of pasta and it is plenty for them.",

The Greek/Italian food here is amazing, the fact that you can order a delicious pizza for an appetizer to share and a kalamari plate for the main is such a nice blend. The prices are also very reasonable for the quantity as well as the quality of food that you are receiving in that prime location of downtown Vancouver. The actual restaurant itself has a nice vibe to it, the patio is great to sit at on a hot summer day. There is another Olympia in Kitsilano, on W. Broadway Street, but is nowhere near the same. The Denman location is leaps and bounds better than the Kits location which I try and avoid. Great dinner for a group of friends, family or just for a date. Servers are always really nice and youll leave here with a filled and satisfied stomach without emptying your wallet.",
