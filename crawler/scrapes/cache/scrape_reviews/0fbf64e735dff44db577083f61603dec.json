Between two people we ordered the Pork and Steak options, both of which had a great texture and were very flavourful. We tried 3 of the 4 side options, which were all delicious and unique. Will definitely be back.",

I have only tried the tofu bowl and it has arrived crispy every single time (which is not the case for many restaurants). My partner who has tried a variety of the meats has also always been extremely happy with the quality. Wed both recommend the Pilaf, Roots, or Winter Squash Chili as our favourite customization options. Ive ordered three times from Gobble now through different delivery services (Uber Eats, SkipTheDishes). The packaging for the food is nice and sturdy so everything has always arrived warm and intact. The first time I ordered from the delivery service, there were some issues with them finding a driver and Gobble had actually called to inform me of the delay so I wasnt left in the dark, and had remade the food so that it would arrive warm even though it wasnt their fault. This hasnt happened with any other restaurants Ive ordered from before and Im really impressed with their customer service.",

I ordered the large porchetta with winter squash and roots as my base, and honey mustard sauce. The root vegetables still had a good crunch, and the combination of the flavours were amazing! The porchetta was topped with chicharon, and that just took it to the next level. This portion was huge! For me,  the large is good enough for two servings. Would definitely order this again, but next time I would probably ask for additional sprinkles of chicharon, and Ill ask for some hot sauce on the side if possible. (Just because I would prefer it spicy.) But still good as is!!!",
