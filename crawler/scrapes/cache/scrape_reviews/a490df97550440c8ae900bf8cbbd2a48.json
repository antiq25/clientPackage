The meat and seafood are always fresh. I d like to get my yoghurt and oat milk here, of which they have many varieties and at reasonable prices. I used to come daily  to their cafe for fresh made breakfast sandwiches and coffee before COVID. Today, I came again. And Marla  at the counter was very patient to customize my breakfast sandwich. Although it was busy, she still came to ask the customers how their breakfasts were. I highly recommend this store, especially their breakfast sandwiches and coffee.",

I got great service from Chase who worked in the bakery dept.  he went out of his way to help me find items and he actually sent me in the wrong direction for something but made the effort to comeback to find me and send me in the right direction which saved me time.  Total appreciate it as that s what I would have done.  I ll definitely start shopping here more often .  Thanks Chase !",

It is a fantastic location right on the arbutus Ridge at the intersection of king Edward and arbutus. The store itself is not the largest loblaws that you will encounter however certainly is pretty full service. The produce is fresh which is a good sign for any type of grocery store. Theres lots of prepared foods here as well and just about anything you could find at a typical loblaws actually. There is pretty good street parking outside and I did not try the underground parking today. Theres lots of bicycle parking out front as well. And they have a large selection of plants for sale outside as well. This was our first time in the store and wanted to see if it would become our staple for groceries as we have just moved into the area. Its a really great location and value for money is good. Will certainly come again and probably very frequently.",

            "review_text": "This store has the best customer service Ive ever encountered! And its not just a few people, it is almost every single employee. When I asked if they had a certain Presidents Choice brand product they didnt just say an aisle number & send me on my way; they actually took me right to the item. And on another occasion where we couldnt find the item anywhere in the store after looking together for 10 minutes, the staff member found his store manager (who was the most knowledgeable about which items are stocked & which have been discontinued). And when the store manager said they didnt carry it, he then proceeded to look up which Presidents Choice type stores (No Frills, City Market, Your Independent Grocer, T&T Supermarket, etc) in Vancouver had it in stock & then wrote down the address on a piece of paper for me & verbally gave me directions to the store. Now *thats* what I call customer service! This City Market also carries a wide variety of higher end items such as an entire wall of specialty cheeses from around the world, artisanal marinated meats & sausages, Presidents Choice brand products not available at any of the other PC stores, artisanal salsas & many other artisanal & high end products. I highly recommend this City Market location. As with most grocery stores today, this location is wheelchair accessible, has wheelchair parking, underground parking accessible from the alley, those half-sized shopping carts that are free (in addition to full-sized grocery carts & carrying baskets) & is open til 11pm (which is great for night owls).",

WOW! 2nd time back here and it still amazes me how beautiful this place looks. I dont care about prices here because this is the rich end of town. They have extensive ready made foods, cool deli (hams hanging and aging), bakery (open concept oven), butcher (meats aging) and even a coffee bar with ice cream. Everybody can complain about service and prices in their review. But really? There are more people working in here than a big Superstore. Try going to a No Frills or an Independent and compare. Prices are cheaper there but you wont get the cool stuff here. Must visit this store at least once to see what a grocery store looks like on the rich side of the city.",

We decided to stop somewhere nice for breakfast, but we decided to scramble into the first place we saw (partner getting a bit hangry)! So we stumbled across Loblaws. We stopped by at the little cute cafe in the back of the store with plenty of seating. Here we found a nice selection of gelato, assortment of coffees, bakery buns, and ofcourse, breakfast sandwiches. Although, they only had the breakfast sandwich on the menu as the only option for breakfast, we looked no further into buying one. My partner ordered a very nice Americano and two of the breakfast sandwiches, and I ordered one. The breakfast sandwiches were only 3.99 each (served on your choice of brioche, croissant or bagel) with grilled bacon, American cheese and an egg with lettuce and tomato. It kept us full and it definitely satisfied my partners tummy. The girls working here are also delightful and give you a good portion! We will be returning!!:)",
