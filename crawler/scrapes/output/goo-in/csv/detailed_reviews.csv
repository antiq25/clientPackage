ChIJs8lGyt1zhlQRssgeHveYgiU,Canadian Tire,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNGZzQyZTZRRRAB,Lin Lin,5,"It was a great service with Canadian tire center! We had a nail on one of our rear tire. We went to costco, bigotire and Mr. lube to get opinions. We were told that we had to replace all 4 tires without even checking. But we just replace a brand new front tire a year ago and only drove less than 3000 Km since. Costco was the worst of all! They were so impatience and told us they had to replace all four tires because they had to be the same brands because they did not carry my tires brand. Their attitude was the worst!  Canadian tire was our last store to get opinion on.  Gensis, Nash and Steven were very helpful and Gensis was very patience with us. He explained a lot of things to us and help us understand the situation. After listening to our story, Gensis told us that they would first check if our tire was repairable then offered options if it was not.  Both Costco and Mr. Lube never even bothered to do what Canadian tire did. They just assumed that we had a nail and all our four tires were needed to be replaced. Gensis at Canadian tire is such a nice guy and a great supervisor/manager I assumed. He went an extra mile for the customer and put our best interest first! As a business owner myself, I really think it is hard to find a great employee like Gensis these days.  In the end, it turned out to be that our tire only needed a patch. It only cost us 70 dollar! At Costco, they quoted us for almost $3000 to replace all tires. We will for sure go back to Canadian for future replacement!

I had quite the experience here over the past month, which started from me trying to simply get my seasonal tire change done. A lot went wrong, but, each time, the service advisors were extremely helpful in explaining why and how, and doing their best to make it right. Which they did. Due strictly to their fantastic service (specifically, Laura and Daniel, A+), this shop gets a no-questions 5/5. Good customer service is the single most important aspect of a successful business, in my opinion, and here it was knocked out of the park. If things go wrong and time is lost to visits where nothing gets done, a good service advisor can make all the difference. When the job finally got done, it got done right, so no issues there. It ended up with me buying a new set of tires and the aligning/balancing that goes with that.

I usually like to look over the discount plant shelf to see if theres anything there that Im care to try to rescue. I ended up picking up two plants (one 5 cm & 10 cm) n the bigger one was almost dried out. I decided to dunk it in a large container nearby that was filled with water n it had a watering can. After I was done n was trying to get out of the closely packed area, a staff member noticed that I picked up some discount plants n complimented me on trying to rescue some of them. After a short conversation, she ended up offering me two of the small 5 cm plants for free as her Xmas gift to me as it was clear that it easily made me happy. Her name was Pat n she said that why not make someone happy if its easy for her to do so n wished me Merry Xmas. I was very pleased with her kindness and wished her the same. TYVM again Pat giving me such a great experience. One more thing, I dont really enjoy being made to use the self check out machines n sincerely wish that theres an option to purchase products from a humin cashier.

I use to go to the market crossing one but due to their being more of a firearms and hunting section at bentall location I started going here. First off joe from the hunting sectional is a phenomenal character and well versed and knowledgeable on almost all firearms and  goods!  His passionate level of service has kept me coming back to browse and shop there for the past year! The sporting good section has an amazing selection and mostly well stocked in what ever you need! He helped me pick out a required firearm and even introduced me to local areas and groups. My second Major deciding factor or point is the Automotive service section.  I had the fortunate luck to notice a problem before a long trip at this location and after being looked at by a third party in the parking lot I rushed into Canadian tire to see if it was service able that weekend!

As my family was preparing to leave for a camping trip early the next morning, we discovered our roof box was broken beyond repair, and since we don t camp light, getting a replacement was crucial.

I called in ahead of time to make sure they had an item because I had a terrible experience at another Canadian Tire location. You could hear that it was busy but Ward went out of his way to provide exceptional customer service. He asked for the item number and had support to make sure the item was available. He confirmed it was and told me what aisle it was in and the location where it would be in the aisle. I walked in, purchased the item and walked out within 5 minutes. My background to the whole experience below. I wanted to pick up Settlers of Catan and saw there were 7 available at the Cambie & 7th location. I went to the location and it took forever to find someone for support. When I did find someone, they told me it wasn t their department and to find the other rep. I found the other rep and had to chase after him as it felt like he was trying to avoid helping clients. Odd when you are hired to help clients. When I asked him about it he said if they are not on the shelf then it s going to be in a box somewhere as they are redoing their toy section. There were a bunch of boxes around the area but he was not even willing to walk over and look on the shelves or even offer to look into a couple of the boxes of items. He just said he can t help and smirked. I am purchasing this item as a family member of a friend of mine is battling cancer. This was a gift to bring their family together through the battle as I heard it s getting tougher at the moment. I was so angry that no one was willing to help. They were clearly unorganized and understaffed.",3 years ago,2020-11-21 21:39:11.282596,Ward sure is amazing and were glad you think so too Jamie.

Their garage service is excellent and I have never had the feeling that they were trying to sell me anything that I didnt need. Im quite knowledgable with cars and would know if they were trying. Usually, they have returned my car without any problems found, which underlines their honesty. The staff and mechanics are friendly and funny. They take their time to explain everything and answer any questions you might have. Only once, my car wasnt locked up when I returned to the parking lot. I asked why and noticed that they had a trainee driving it to the parking lot. I havent seen her since. I usually keep an eye out to see when my car is back on the lot and ready for pick-up, because they do not always call you right away when theyre busy, but the time they tell you it requires to fix your car or do the oil change and inspection is usually correct, so you know when to be back. The one thing I would like to suggest is to always apply the handbrake when taking a customers car back to the lot, because I have never seen anyone do that.

It turns out that June is a very bad time to be looking for a bicycle and, we needed 2, a mans and a ladys. Shops are sold out all over the lower mainland, even several of the Canadian Tire stores were also low on stock. We found a ladys bike we liked at the store in Burnaby South and drove from North Vancouver to have a look. When we got there we were not able to find it (it turns out that it was there; however, it had a yellow tag on it indicating that it was put on layaway). We were disappointed and were about to settle for something else when we happened upon Rod, the manager. We talked some and eventually got around to the point that we were actually looking for an E-Bike but were having trouble finding one for a reasonable price. Rod said that he has a mans and a ladys E-Bike in stoke and before I could say hold the phone he went to the back to bring  out the ladys version. We talked some more when Rod said Ill see what I can do about the price. My wife and I discussed the merits of purchasing an E-Bike from Canadian Tire when Rod came back and quoted an amount which was 30% less than the ticketed price. Wow, that is a good deal. We will buy both of them! I said. As it turned out, the mans bike had a couple of issues which I noticed later: 1) it didnt have a rear rat trap and 2) the motor would not engage when I peddled. After fiddle farting around with the electronics , I discovered that the crank sensor was mounted on the wrong side of the crank assembly. On the working ladys bike , the sensor was on the left hand side of the crank assembly. On the mens bike , the sensor was on the right side. I decided not to try to fix this and simply return this to another Canadian Tire store which had these bikes in store for an exchange. The South Burnaby store was sold out.

Now i have seen alot of repairs on my own vehicles over the years and spentalot of time wrenching my trucks in the parking lot just like my dad would do . And my favorite part as a kid was getting to keep the canadian tire money. Over the years its been growing into a great all round needs kinda store there house brand is become very compeditive with the big name power tools and at a price way below which is a good thing for the low budget people or if you are just a tight wad like my self . They have a great spray paint selection for those small paint jobs or brush on or larger sprayer paints as well as all your paint accessories.  The auto motive section is large and user friendly lay out for the self serve types or if you need help well good luck on fast service and when you get it its rare to find an employee wllling to solve your needs if they dont have what you need .that being said  i think over all this world would not be the same without canadian tire .

From the special menu we got the aburi salmon on rice and the BBQ eel rice. The rest of the dishes were from the regular menu. These include: smoked monkfish liver, Takowasabi, karaage, takoyaki, and ikamaru (grilled squid). For dessert we ordered the mochi ice cream. The aburi salmon was fantastic. It was plated beautifully. The salmon looked overdone but in fact, it was lightly torched. This in combination with the vinegary sushi rice was delicious. You have to drizzle some of the soy based sauce that they provide. It was an umami rich experience. The BBQ eel rice was hands down the best I had ever eaten.

My Partner and I were just out for a walk a few weeks ago and accidentally stumbled upon this place. I am so happy we did because they are amazing, all around. Ive been three times since! Atmosphere 5/5 Food Quality 5/5 Food Quantity 3/5 Atmosphere is so friendly and up beat. I wasnt expecting to feel so welcomed, but as soon as you walk in the whole staff greets you! They also say goodbye when you leave. - I thought that was the sweetest thing. The staff in overall is super nice. Everyone here was laughing and having a great time (socially distanced of course.) Not too loud too, I can still have a conversation at my table and not feel like Im yelling. That is SO important to me. Food quality is amazing. Ive been to some great restaurants before and I have to say, not that I love paying lots of money for food, but Guu could charge 2x as much as they do for some of the items on their menu. AMAZING dishes. GREAT for sharing. The chefs here know what they are doing. I would recommend off the dinner menu: - Sashimi Salad - Salmon Yukke - Negitoro - Tuna & Salmon Tataki (fav on the menu) - Beef Tataki - Kimchi Fried Rice (my partners fav on the menu) Food quantity is not as much for some items, like the Tataki and the Yukke. You are paying for the quality, so dont expect a feast! Some other items though, like the Kimichi fried rice, is almost TOO much food.

We both order the lunch Royal bento box and was delighted my it arrived.  Everything looked appetizing with bright colours and organized placement in the bento box with attention to detail. The Royal bento box includes: - 3 kinds of sashimi - ebi mayo - chicken and cauliflower karaage - ingren fries - bang bang e salad - saba shima sushi - grilled fish - vegetable kobachi - miso soup. My favourite were the fresh sashimi, specifically salmon and scallops.  They both melted in the mouth and you knew they were fresh.  The rest of of the items, honestly was also delicious.  The shrimp was super big and juicy in the ebi mayo.  The chicken was boneless and super moist and crunchy on the outside.

The seating where you had to take off your shoes had foot warmers there to keep you warm in the colder winter days. Super nice. The staff would shout orders from right next to you to the bar if needed, so expect that when coming. :) There were a lot of Winter specials when we came and the prices were really fair for the portion. Beef tartar was one of our specials (amazing flavor, nice tender cuts that werent chewy at all). The uni and scallop croquette was nicely fried with such a rich filling. I was looking forward to finally having aburi, so I ordered the salmon off of the original menu. Nice sear on the salmon that complemented the seasoned rice, topped with warm, earthy, slightly spicy spices. So, so good. The mackerel was also really tasty, with a nicely salted fish and seasoned rice. Overall, all of the other dishes were really tasty and I enjoyed everything. The fried cheesecake ice cream was also very tasty, nothing much else like it that I ever had.

The staff were very attentive to keep our teapot full while checking in periodically to ensure no empty dishes cluttered our table. For this level of service and quality of food, we would have expected much higher prices.

Of the three Guus in Vancouver, Guu with Otokomae in Gastown is, by far, our favorite.  In fact, it is our favorite restaurant in a city of great restaurants.  Everything weve had there, every time we went there, has been AMAZING! On this latest visit, we started with Takowasa.  Small pieces of raw  baby octopus legs were mixed with wasabi stems and served with nori to be wrapped.  A unique and wonderful taste and textural experience not to be missed. The Spicy Agedashi Tofu is absolutely the best weve ever had.  Small one-bite cubes of tofu is battered and deep fried, then bathed in a dashi and topped with pure goodness.  The batter is so light and thin that it serves mainly to hold the great flavor-packed dashi onto the tofu.  We slurped every bit of the fantastic dashi after finishing the tofu. The Spicy Shrimp and Pork Wontons were amazing.  The skin was a perfect al dente and the shrimp and pork filling was delicious.  With the spicy sauce, it was complete. Just when we thought that the meal was a complete success, along came the Black Cod.  It was grilled and presented in a white wine Saikyo miso sauce.  It was the most delicately textured, delectably flavored piece if fish that weve ever had.

The usual dim sum staples can be found here, at the standard prices, and the usual service as other dim sum places.   Its just an easy neighborhood low key place for us to go for dim sum.

So we ended up eating fried chicken nearby out of desperate hunger :-0. Then I researched the area on Google maps and found Come Along. After looking at the helpful food pictures online, I decided that we should try it next time we are in the area. I had to convince my partner to walk in because the lack of activities and people outside gave us the impression that it cant be that good. We were really surprised after we got past the front door. The place was not that big, but buzzing with activities. Lots of people eating their lunch happily. And these people looked like they are regulars. The interior even looked fresh and new. We ordered a simple lunch of fish congee, fried Chinese donuts, tofu skin with baby bok choy in vegetable broth, and shrimp dumpling. The congee was delicious. They used cod filet which was very tender. The Chinese donut was reheated so that was disappointing. The tofu skin dish was very good also, the har gow were huge. We returned for dinner another night with 5 friends. We tried Peking duck, there was duck meat attached to the skin which my friend said is the Cantonese way of doing Peking duck. The skin was crispy. The pancake was freshly made, but a bit on the thick side. They had a special on rock cod. We order a 2 lb one. It was excellent! We were all surprised how tender the cod was, usually, rock cod over 1.5 lbs tend to be on the tough side. We ordered two kinds of tofu; egg tofu with steamed dried scallops, and braised tofu with vegetables. I was not impressed with the braised tofu, it seemed dried and pre-made. The egg tofu was fine. I think we didnt necessarily pick the right mix of dishes. I did, however, see a lot of interesting dished coming out of the kitchen to other tables. The manager was friendly and helpful, and the service was pleasant. It was a Monday night, so we avoided the crowd.

I was so happy to find out that the restaurant was going to come back and as soon as it opened and I passed by, I dropped by with my partner to reminisce the past. The food is just as good as before, I d say the Thai fried rice was pretty much similar to what it was before but a little bit less seasoned compared to before. It could just be a hit or miss but I d say that was a 9/10. I ve always come to Etea just to order Thai fried rice. The second order was popcorn chicken nuggets, a little saltier than expected but the seasoning was really good. The portion could be bigger for $10.80 since it was a small plate but the quality is good and technically there are other restaurants that do charge it for more expensive. The Taro slush with pearls was really good, the portion size was not as large as I thought it would be but the price for the bubble tea was standard, not as expensive as other bubble tea shops and they made it well. I found it pretty interesting that there was a bear on top (it s ice) as part of the decoration. Presentation was really good, but because the cup was smaller than usual when I ordered a size large, I would say the bear takes away the portion size. Overall I would order again and their idea of putting the bear on top overall is a creative idea. Would definitely come back again, was a regular before and will be a regular as per usual. Parking: 8 spots, pretty small and weird parking spots. A few blind spots. There is street parking which is more recommended.",6 months ago,2023-05-30 22:21:54.358192,thanks collin for your advice and detail review. we are happy to see you guys again. cheers,6 months ago,2023-05-30 22:21:54.358192,0,53,124,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110697880280306295392/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

The delivery time expected was the fastest offered when I used dim sum as a search term-and they did NOT disappoint! For those of you who would like to read further, I shall elaborate.  The packaging was thoughtfully done with sturdy circular cardboard containers-not the kind I can keep as tupperware but eminently recyclable.  The sauces were kept in cute lil plastic containers inside the containers of their respective dishes-as a result of this thoughtful packaging, all foods and sauces arrived with only a few drops of spillage. We ordered a combination of hot dim sum and cold Hong Kong style iced tea as well as some frozen dumplings for later.  They were kept in appropriately separated paper bags, keeping the hot stuff hot (but not burningly so), and the cold stuff cold.  A solid A well deserved on the delivery front.  Now to taste. The frozen potstickers I ordered I sadly cannot include in this review as I have not eaten them. The Hong Kong style tea was very strong, but not very sweet.  I have a bit of a sweet tooth so I didn t love it myself but if you prefer watching your sugar intake I think you ll definitely like it. The dim sum selection wasn t huge but the items were excellent!  I had red bean sesame balls, black sesame buns, steamed shrimp dumplings, char siu (pork dumplings with a single wonton wrapping), deep fried pork buns, and popcorn chicken. I ll list them in order: Red Bean Sesame Balls: Fantastic.  I had them elsewhere and found them quite greasy.  Here they weren t, but still had their wonderful earthy character. Black Sesame Buns: My boo especially liked these due to their softness.  For me the black sesame filling was quite competently done.   Nuff said! Shrimp Dumplings: Exactly what you would expect in this town-nice, moist and warm.  Went with the mild soy sauce quite nicely. Char Siu: Wonderfully juicy.  The mild soy sauce that dripped on them slightly played off the pork brilliantly too. Deep Fried Pork Buns:  What is rich and salty for me is quite beloved by my boo, and these treats were no exception.  I let him have the majority. Popcorn Chicken:  The lone disappointment-though well seasoned, the popcorn bits were very often small enough in this dish that they could not contain chicken.  The pieces that did have chicken though were quite tasty and went quite well with a sweet ish sauce we mixed up ourselves. Overall, this delivery was extremely well done and I very much look forward to the day that I can visit this Hon s branch in person.",a year ago,2022-11-30 22:22:17.511417,Your review is much appreciated   Looking forward to seeing you soon!,a year ago,2022-11-30 22:22:17.511417,1,3,6,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101863418068452681852/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

Ordered a chirashi Don and that was it. The presentation  is quite fancy as it was served on a plate(instead of a bowl, where you would expect of from a don (rice bowl) item). The sashimi were all chopped up.. there were scallop, tuna, bbq eel, salmon, seaweed, the usual.. pickled radish was also in the mix which adds a nice touch. Food was generally okay, service was prompt and friendly.. I just have 2 problems: The first problem was that they seem to be trying to be fancy just for the sake of being fancy. The chirashi don had BBQ EEL in it, this is definitely atypical and I think theres reasons for it.. what are you supposed to do then, if you were to add soy sauce in for the sashimi, it would ruin the bbq eel, if you dont add soy sauce, then the sashimi is kinda tasteless (and why serve soy sauce if that was the intend? Also, everything came chopped up so its hard to pick out specific fish (in this case the bbq eel) and eat them separately.. not to mention that eating a rice dish on a plate is just clumsy (and Im Chinese).. the food is great, just not very practical. The second, and bigger problem for me is the portion. Im pretty sure a grown man can eat at least two, or even of three of these. And that even petite women could find this portion unsatisfying. I understand that guu is an izakaya place and therefore their dish is sized accordingly. But not a lot of people is going to enjoy izakaya during lunch hour.

My family of three went and ordered and ate flounder, codfish soup, and pork rice bowl. If you go before 3 oclock, you can eat stone pot rice, but we ate it with stone pot rice. I couldnt take a picture because I was eating, but the flounder was very delicious and the quantity was huge. Daegu tang was very cold and delicious. It was nice to eat Jeyuk-deopbap with rice and meat on top of a stone-cooked stone pot. Three side dishes, including kimchi, were served, and I wanted the portion to be small at first, but the staff brought it to me and told me to tell you more if it was not enough, so I ate it and refilled it once more. The main portion was large, so I didnt order more side dishes, but it was really delicious. The side dishes and main dishes are really delicious, so I want to visit again next time I come to Vancouver. This is a restaurant that you can recommend to your friends. If you visit before 3pm, you can eat rice in a stone pot, so it would be nice to refer to it. Gajami tempura is highly recommended.",10 months ago,2023-01-30 22:22:36.608948,,,,3,19,10,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105885088091925851984/reviews?entry=ttu,True,".                 ,    ,                 .  3                                       .                ,                              .                  .                                                    .         3                               ,                                            .                                            .                                          .                      .     3                                          .             .",

I ate at Seafood 1st Street a few times, but the seasoning was good, but I was always disappointed that the bean sprouts, which account for most of Agu-jjim, were overcooked, so the water was drained instead of crispy, and the texture was thin and tough. Sols Agujjim was rumored to be good, so I ordered it after seeing a review, but the rumor is really true. The crunchy texture of bean sprouts is the same and the seasoning is delicious. However, there was too much red pepper powder and it was very spicy. Next time Ill have to order a little less spicy.
