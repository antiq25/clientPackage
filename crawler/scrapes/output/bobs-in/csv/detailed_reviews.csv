The crunch off each and every bite was unreal. I also went for a side of biscuits and gravy. I have to say that the gravy is also an amazing dip for French fries!

We saw her and waved and she was able to sit us in her section! Always such a pleasure seeing her happy face to start our day! All the servers at Bobs has ALWAYS been awesome no matter who you get! They run the operation like In and Out. Superb customer service and their quality of food, portions and pricing is always good. We originally headed to Sweet Butter on Ventura but opted for friendly smiles and table service. We decided to go all out today and have something out of the ordinary. We had the The Big Three and a Belgian Waflle with two eggs and sausage. Our Big Three came with three eggs, three flapjacks and three links of sausage. We ordered extra sausage on the side because their links are delicous! We already had pork belly last night so we werent feeling bacon today. Our Belgium Waffle combo came with two eggs and sausage. I had Janelle bring me fresh strawberries and butter for my waffle because Im not fond of syrup at all. We had such a great breakfast and a great start to our day knowing that we were able to be graced by Janelle. Shes the best! She always kept our drinks filled and just being around her was very calming. Its very busy at Bobs but when you have a chance to enjoy the good company and want great service, you can at Bobs. 2019: Love this place! No matter what time of day we visit, the service is excellent! We were greeted by a huge smile from Esther! She has the best sense of humor ever and is the sweetest. We didnt have to wait long at all. It was quick and the host was also friendly when he sat us. It was MLK Jr. Day so it was busy with many large parties. We had one of the best servers there, Kebra. She always had a smile and took really good care of us even though her section was quickly being filled by a couple of four tops and a large 15 top party.  She rocked and always remained serene and calm. We had the fried chicken entree and the 8 oz. Sirloin steak. With our entrees we chose a nice side salad, steamed vegetables and mash potatoes. His fried chicken came with white gravy. I didnt want gravy and Im so glad. Those were the creamiest, rich mash potatoes Ive ever had. I would definitely go there just for a side of them. The fried chicken was juicy, lightly crispy and well seasoned. My steak was cooked to perfection - rare. I was surprised that my steak was cooked so well. There was clear fluid running out of it yet it was seared, juicy and deliciously rare! This place never fails. Everyones attitudes are wonderful here and make our experience memorable. As we left, again we encountered lovely Esther who wished is a nice evening. Whatever they are doing here must be the same practices as In and Out because they never disappoint, provide exceptional customer service and the food preparation and quality is consistent.

Ambience: Bobs big boy s ambiance is 10/10 everyone in California needs to see this. 2. Deals: Were talking deals. Pretty solid value for money. It s hard because there are other diners that also great value for money but can t complain, pretty good value for money. Not the best deal I ve ever had but not the worst deal. 3. Clientele: there were a lot of people at bbb at 11 o clock at night but we didn t have to wait long for a table. Other patrons also seemed to appreciate deals and milkshakes as many people ordered milkshakes. Unlike some diners I ve been to I didn t fear too much for my personal safety but I was a little intimidated but the BIG BOI holding the hamburger outside. 4: decor: speaking big boys, there some big big boys and smaller big boys (aka medium boys) displayed.

Visited this past Monday (President s Day) and anticipated it to be crowded or just lack luster with respect to customer experience. I checked out the website the Sunday before and located a bed that I was looking for. I cringed at the thought of goin into the store as a customer service representative for over 10 years -I know the pressures to meet sales goals. However there was no pressure from the Guest Experience Specialist ( Elivin) was very knowledgeable and even pointed out some defects which were part of the manufacturing details which I appreciated. I was not sure if I was going to finalize a purchase but I did. I met with the store manager and he closed the sale. Very impressed by the service and suggest if you live are in the neighborhood-please stop by you will not be disappointed!,9 months ago,2023-02-28 12:16:45.381008,,,,0,1,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106285661086248586792/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

He was very knowledgeable, not pushy, and easy to talk to. We looked at the two different reclining sofas we saw online and he knew every detail about both. However, the computer ordering system in the store has an issue that assigns a warehouse that isnt the warehouse where we would be picking up, Frank was explaining all of this information to us. He called over the store manager who immediately acted like he was better than anyone in the room. Frank was just giving him a friendly heads-up about how the system was still having the error. The manager responded weve gone over this multiple times and continued on, borderline embarrassing Frank. Frank was just letting him know it was still an issue, Frank was very knowledgeable and on point. We had to do some additional measuring and we were very happy to be able to give Frank Credit on our online order. He called and thanked us genuinely but I couldnt move forward without leaving this review about the manager as its been bothering me. Very distasteful, disrespectful, and not needed. I think some respect is needed for Frank who did a great job giving us all the information we needed to finalize our purchase.

Special Shout-out of Gratitude to Junior Martinez and Heather Gonzalez in the Escondido Store. Let me start off by giving you a little background on what led up to me deciding to contact Bobs. Originally I ordered leather living room and family room furniture from Wayfair in August But...was sent an apology email in October (2 months later) that my order had been canceled because the furniture had been discontinued. To No fault of theirs I also received great customer service from Wayfair. So... Im not knocking Wayfair guys but I believe the furniture was coming from Canada plus it had something to do with the issues and problems weve been experiencing with the Cargo Ships not being able to get through. Back to online shopping I went and I decided to give Bobs a call instead. Heather answered the phone and after explaining my situation to her she immediately went to work looking for a replacement for me. Even though what she found was lighter then what I had originally ordered from Wayfair, Heather convinced me to at least let her text me a picture of some Italian Leather Furniture that they had in-stock in their Warehouse in Escondido and guaranteed it would be delivered within one week. After seeing the picture of the furniture that she text to me, I immediately fell in love. Plus, she was able to get me 12-month interest free financing which was a Bonus and sealed the deal for me. I also purchased their Goof Proof Warranty which I highly recommend. After everything was said and done I actually set-up delivery for 2 weeks later because I had to sell my old furniture first. Even the delivery guys were awesome and gave great customer service. They arrived early, set-up my furniture and were very polite and courteous. I was so happy with Bobs customer service guys that I bought an additional Chair and Ottoman for the living room from Heather and set-up in-store pickup from their Long Beach Warehouse. But...somehow this order got mixed-up for in-store pickup in the Escondido Store (1.5 to 2 hours) away. Thats when I had the pleasure of speaking with Junior who called to tell me my chair and ottoman were ready for pickup in the Escondido Store. I explained to Junior that originally I was suppose to pick-up the furniture at their store in Long Beach. Junior immediately spoke with the Store Manager who gave the approval to use an outside delivery service to have the furniture delivered to our home at no additional cost to us. Now Thats Great Customer Service Guys! So...before you shop anywhere else please give Bobs Discount Furniture a Try!",a year ago,2022-11-30 12:17:01.749753,,,,1,8,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103342525071652699623/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

The carrots, smashed potatoes and brocollini were great and so was the creme brulee. I was also impressed and thankful they ask about allergies and were accommodating. The restaurant is elegant and classy, and I was glad to see them enforce the dress code to even the wealthiest folks who ignored it.

Can take home left overs but some things are just not the same.  Service is outstanding and drinks are great.  Biggest problem is that it is so very noisy you cannot hold a conversation.

I was very excited to have this new restaurant in McKinney as its close to my home. My wife and I dined at the bar. The menu is slightly different and seemed a bit pricier than other locations. Not a show stopper, but just an observation. As other reviews state the bartenders are friendly and attentive. Food was on point although a bit slow on arrival. There were no chef specials that evening, growing pains I expect. The entrance hallway is very enticing, but the bar and dining areas seemed a bit off, perhaps a bit too bright. I will probably wait a while for a return visit.",5 months ago,2023-06-30 12:17:30.995090,,,,3,3,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116626705678960615957/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

We had a party of 6 and we could not hear across the table. You had to concentrate on what the person next to you was saying. It was way too loud. It was nice to go outside where it was quieter. We ate from 6:00 to 8:00 PM. It was fun, but very loud! I checked the decibel level and it was 79-94 decibels. The appetizer of fried onion rings was more than ample for our 6. There were 12 of them. The Fried shrimp was awesome. Caesar Salad was very tasty. Filet Mignonette was really good. We did not try desserts as we were full, but they were huge. We saw cake and Icecream. The room was square so sound was amplified. We will give them another try. The price was comparable to other upscale restaurants. 6 Shrimp, a big carrot, massed potatoes and salad was $40. Steak was $50, $60, or $70 for 6, 12, and 16 oz respective.
