Although Im not typically inclined to spend a lot on food, I hesitated when I saw the $15 price tag for the dish I wanted. However, after observing others orders, I decided to give it a try, and Im glad I did. I chose the chicken bowl, and the Middle Eastern flavors were fantastic, while the portion size was adequate. The only downside was that the restaurant was a bit chilly, but since its located near the entrance and its freezing outside, this is likely the case for most places along Main Street. I had a great experience here and enjoyed the shawarma. The meat was very flavorful and everything appeared to be fresh. The portion size was decent, although the bowl had more veggies than meat. Additionally, the cost was a bit high, but overall it was a positive experience. Its worth noting that all the meat served is Halal.",8 months ago,2023-04-07 22:16:14.365460,"That s great Karan, we are so glad you liked it.

I will definitely be returning. The food was phenomenal and give the Mint Lemonade a try and thank me later :) Old Review: We went in to order take out. The staff were super friendly. Issue was that after picking up our order and walking to our destination to eat our food, we found multiple HAIRS in our food. At this point we had walked too far to go back and it was around closing time. Ended up not eating the food (besides this being disgusting, we are in the middle of a pandemic). I sent an email to the store with pictures, and the least I was expecting was a were sorry, we will make sure ALL staff whom are handling and/or exposed to the food wear a hair net. But instead, there was no reply from the restaurant. In conclusion, they make very yummy food, but I would caution you to check your food and perhaps avoid the restaurant altogether until the kitchen staff wear hair nets. Good thing is that you can see the kitchen staff if they dont wear hair nets.",2 years ago,2021-12-07 22:16:19.561853,"Thanks! We are glad it all worked out.
