Even doordash and uber eats receive their deliveries from the security officer making it even more professional. Now I can tell the management worked hard to re- establish this place. I really hope this place holds their security officer which is very polite and professional. I also hope other McDonalds with busy downtown traffic to employ security officers , especially once covid is over and night clubs re opens.",3 years ago,2020-12-01 01:46:17.749327,,,,0,64,127,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100558155610835972967/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

The first time I got my order, I wasn t satisfied with my burger and coffee so I went in and ordered a second one. The girl told me I don t have to pay but I insisted on paying cuz I ate the burger already.  The second one I ordered I told them make sure there s no Mac chicken sauce but I got sauce in it again.  I tried to go back to drive thru to complain my coffee spilled all over my car.  So I went inside and talked to the manager, who was not very sympathetic so I just walked away and started cleaning my car outside.  I saw $10 on the ground, I picked it up, asked the guys if it s theirs but they said no. By the ways my meal costed me about the exact same amount.  Within a few mins, a really sweet girl, exactly like an  angel  came out with the money in her hand for my meal and a towel to help me clean my car. Omg I mean how this girl changed my whole day!! I can t describe it ... she was insisting on cleaning my rug and told me tat there s a new order coming up for me. She was so nice and sweet that I felt bad about the whole situation. She comforted me hugged me, and so I was curious wat is she?? asked her name, she said her name is Miriam, and she is from Iraq. I stopped myself after she left and started thinking about; if everybody was like her, there would not be any racism, any fights, nor any trouble in this world. I m sure the manager sent her to make sure I leave happy but she went way beyond anyone s expectations. I m in the same field myself for more then 15 years but I don t think I have done or seen anything like this before.

I tried to dispute the parking ticket with Royal Parkings and explained the situation, even attached my receipt. The appeal department replied and said as long as I left the parking lot Id need to pay for the ticket. I actually walked straight to the restaurant and spent an hour in there with food and drinks from McDonalds, but still need to pay for the ticket just because I went through a different door?

The staff are all very friendly and you get the standard McDonalds taste we all expect.....but theres more. This is single handedly the MOST ENTERTAINING McDonalds Ive ever been in. The perpetual state of neutral chaos going on at this location is worth the $1.89+ price of admission. Pre-Pandemic Id go in on a Friday night just to see the equivalent of a performance art production. New Years Eve (in years without a global pandemic) is truly a spectacular event with 100s of drunk youngster (of age presumably) getting their McD****s fix.

It is Nov 13th 2016 in the afternoon. Its not terribly busy, theres 2 floors with the upstairs hosting one of the rare play places, and the service is on point. I walked in, saw the digital ordering kiosks. I love how amazingly powerful they are. Dont forget that you can tap on an order and hit Customize to go crazy with the most granular possible nit picky stuff you can think of.  Today the Build Your Taste burger builder was fully integrated and let me absolutely get the details I wanted. Once the order was complete it got me to pick up an elecronic device known as a Table Tracker, this allowed me to bring my kid upstairs to the play place with my number and pretty close after ordering two gentlemen came upstairs with my order on a wooden paddle, and my daughters happy meal carried separately and carefully. The men asked us if we wanted any condiments, to which we asked for ketchup to which they happily obliged. No restaurant, especially fast food, has evolved over time quite like McDonalds. I though McCafe was a pretty big deal when it came around but now McDonalds seems to be catering to thise who want real food, with real service one could experience at a standard family restaurant.  Except i dont have to wait 35 minutes to an hour gor my order to come about. I imagine it wont be like this all the time, in fact im pretty sure to expect just like what happened to FatBurger.

I have talked to you multiple times due to very bad management that I faced in your store, but today I wanted to congratulate you with hiring -Pegah-. What amazing customer service she provided to me today. Honestly, this was the best level of service I have ever received in any fast food. I can tell the level of customer service was in a level of a high end luxury dine in restaurants. There was a big mistake that happened at the drive thru by one of your employees and after I got to the payment window, I saw -Pegah- already there to make sure there is nothing to get mistaken, she actively listened and apologized to me for the mistake without me even get upset, so at the point that I found that I have been taken care of to get  the right food, I was even thinking about time, mistakes and getting angry. It was an amazing feeling I have received when I got taken care of not only for the money that I paid extra and the wrong sandwich, but she kindly provided me with free apple pie and asked me to keep the wrong sandwiches even though I didnt order them. As a long term manager in retail, I want to thank you (Mina) for getting amazing people like -Pegah- hired in your team and thank -Pegah- for her amazing service.

We went to local McDonalds located in 15574 Fraser Hwy to find out if this McDonalds was accessible for people who use wheelchairs or scooters. We were able to find things that made this place accessible. First, there were two accessible parking spots available right beside the entrance to the store. Second, the doors of the store could be opened by pressing a button that is placed on the wall beside the door. There is a ramp for wheelchairs and scooters to go up. Also, they are planning to get new doors so that it is easier for wheelchair and scooter users to use. The bathroom doors do not have buttons on the wall, but the sink, the toilet paper, the dryer, and the soap were placed low so that they can be easily accessed by wheelchair and scooter users.

This location really needs its own full-time security personnel. She should not have had to handle that on her own, or wait for mall security to arrive.

She was the second manager I talked to and was understanding. The first one I talked to told me to hold and passed me over to Brandon. Brandon did a good job of understanding what the situation was. Ps: Sorry if I spelled your name wrong Ps: To the other manager if you see this I hope you learn stuff Ps: I give 5 stars to the manager not to the store for she did the right thing at the right time My parents always get told off because they cant understand people and today there was something wrong with the order in which they actually give a coupon and showed the cashier what they wanted but they did the wrong order and was quite rude about not changing it for them.(they did in the end but it was still more expensive when they asked for a different burger) My parents told me when they got home. And I was livid with this happening at McDonald when they should be trained better then anyone.

When cv19 hit I was really big and decided to intermittent fast and choose a keto designed lifestyle.  I never drank coffee before but now needed to due to my fasting. So each day 5 days a week around 6:30am I drive to order my xtra large coffee for 2.40$ and get a couple butters to put into it which helps me stave off hunger till I break my fast at 11am. The staff is amazing and I always collect the tiny sticker to get my almost free xtra large on the 8th visit. I should double dip on the points I havent yet maybe I will do so soon. Staff is great, quick and look forward to a smile and a have a great day...it is almost like Im harkened back to Mulberry in the 50s they are so nice.",a year ago,2022-12-02 21:54:57.661627,,,,1,31,18,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111374643755470263334/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

Its always the same morning crew who are courteous, and efficient in moving customers through the line up which means they are organized in the kitchen, and have a great team leader.

Everytime I come by at such a late hour and always asking for a picky order ie  made fresh please  I have been welcomed with politeness and gratitude for my order. Some people are always polite and nice even working nights shift (beats me, I ve done it and I m a monster during those hours).nonetheless to my surprise, not only was the male who was getting off at 3am was super polite with my order and payment but as I rolled to the last window to pick up my order (you can tell this lady was tired) she was polite, gracious and  patient as I check the bag for the sauces to my delicious nuggets that were made fresh (I know this cause while we were digging through the order it was hot af [she told us  don t burn your hands ]) she didn t make a fuss but told us have a good night after. They all deserve a raise and i send my utmost gratitude for their work (hope they see this) and attitude during the graveyard shift. Thanks guys, I made sure to drop by this one while I drove by other McDonald s on the way home. To the owner, they deserve a raise if not, at least a gift card for their consistent service.

One takes payment, the other gives you your order. They are awesome. Friendly, smiling, upbeat and a pleasure to see each time we would grab a coffee or breakfast. I give them 5 stars But in the evenings the kids working are robotic, impersonal, and do not exhibit the friendly helpful manners of customer service. The ice cream machines always broken. I cant get less ice in my drink, even when i request it. The cold drinks have more ice than soda, yet mcdonalds limits the drink orders because they dont have enough ice. It was hot out, we were all thirsty, and only 4 out of five of us were allowed to buy a drink. I couldnt order any cold drink even if I didnt want ice in mine. If mcdonalds used less ice in the fountain drinks, customers could get enough liquid to wash down their meal, and they could hydrate more customers. But they dont have what their signs have advertising 60% of the time.

McDonalds are millionaires...they should put efforts in finding a solution for all ethnic of any background feel welcome and be part of their family...if u have time to rebuild to install table with number and order box stations for customers... shouldnt u have grills for beef separate from grills for bacon...and use vegetable oils for all ingredients...all ur workers should equally respect changing gloves according to what their cooking...imagine if doctors never washed their hands or never changed glove for each patient he sees...how sick the world would get... McDonalds serve thousands and millions a day throughout the world... McDonalds like a mother preparing meals for her family...would she give none caring meals that might not be agreeable with each individual needs...trust me Im a mom...I have to watch out for allergies...one wants to be vegetarian...one loves more beef...the other wants chicken...no pork families have rights to be welcome at McDonalds...so make it happen...thx,5 years ago,2018-12-01 01:50:11.760232,,,,1,9,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107033444819228052670/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

Wifi speed is about 14 Mbps download. Not a kids concentrated area so the freebies for kids such as drawing paper, color crayons, balloons have decent availability. Theres this manager whos energetic and I like his attitude towards work and customer service. He seems to recognize many regular customers and they like to have a short chat with him.

The Panorama location, in my opinion is not only the most pleasant McDonalds location that I have experience but the most pleasant fast food restaurant that I know of. The staff is super friendly and the location is very clean on a consistent basis. The manager working, Earin has an excellent attitude and I can see she leads her entire staff by example. I eat here often and there are times when its busy and the manager keeps her cool and you can see the confidence in her and her team. I also see that the organization takes their customers serious by their recognition of adding a better drive through. Overall, I think I speak for alot of others when I say, this McDonalds location is a great part of the community and the people that work here should be recognized for their efforts.

With the current pandemic going on, it s understandable if the staffs were as stressed as customers like me, but all of them treated me with care and respect, which I appreciate very much and want to let people know about it. This is my first time having issues with McDonald s in general, but isn t the first time I experienced high level of attention and care from the staffs of this McDonald s location. From other places, I experienced and understood there s always a certain SOP to satisfy (upset) customers and handle situations like this, but the professional and careful attitudes makes all the difference.

Let me just say, I was thoroughly convinced that this fast-food chain knows how to deliver a satisfying and delicious experience. The Big Mac meal truly lives up to its reputation. The moment I unwrapped the iconic burger, I was greeted by a mouthwatering aroma that instantly made my taste buds dance with anticipation. The perfectly toasted sesame seed bun held together two juicy beef patties, topped with the signature Big Mac sauce, crisp lettuce, tangy pickles, and melted cheese. Every bite was a symphony of flavors that left me wanting more. What impressed me the most was the consistency in the quality of the Big Mac meal. No matter which McDonalds location I visit, I can always count on the same great taste and satisfaction. This level of reliability is a testament to their commitment to delivering a consistently delicious product. In addition to the incredible taste, the value for money at McDonalds is unbeatable. The Big Mac meal offers a generous portion size that leaves you feeling fully satisfied without breaking the bank. Its the perfect option for a quick and affordable meal that doesnt compromise on taste or quality. The service at McDonalds is also worth mentioning. The staff members are always friendly, efficient, and ready to assist with any requests. Whether its customizing your order or providing recommendations, they go above and beyond to ensure a pleasant dining experience. Overall, McDonalds has truly mastered the art of the Big Mac meal. The combination of mouthwatering flavors, consistent quality, and excellent service make it a go-to choice for a quick and satisfying meal.

One day I walked in for a cold dessert and encountered the bubbliest, happiest, the most joyful employee I have ever encountered. Even with her mask on, I can tell she was smiling ear to ear as she took my order. It felt very welcoming and it was a nice change. The way she would communicate with her coworkers, with so much respect and care, showed me that her demeanor is genuine. The amount of joy she was putting out was radiating throughout the place and I picked up on it. I was having a long day (hence why I came in for the dessert) and she totally changed my mood. Justine is going places and making a lot of people happy in the process. If management sees this review please let Justine know how much of a difference she is making at your location.

I used to get breakfast here a couple of times a week and eventually one of the ladies started recognising me and remembering my order and I would usually just have to confirm between two items that I always ordered. I am now working from home so I no longer go there, but I sometimes miss my little routine and receiving great customer service! Previous review: This is one of the worst locations Ive been to in Vancouver.  There are two women here that are part of the morning crew who give the most horrendous service I have ever experienced and one of them is a supervisor/manager. They dont know how to listen and as a result they get my order wrong...often. Theres nothing complicated about ordering a McMuffin without cheese and two hashbrowns. When I order coffee, they get the size or number of creams wrong. This isnt Starbucks and Im not ordering a complicated drink but somehow a simple cup of coffee gets messed up almost every time. They often ring in my order wrong and I have to repeat myself two or three times before they get it right and they like to argue with me as if Im doing something wrong.

Ive never had any negative expereinces here as far as the food goes. The service is good, and they are friendly, however it is a small location and does get busy a lot of the time. And lines of even 4 or 5 people can be significantly long, especially while going during lunch. As for the morning, they have had no hashbrowns quite a few times that I have gone for breakfast during my break. They stopped giving out napkins at the self-serve drink dispensers and you have to go to the counter to ask for them, which is a bit strange. But apart from those few things, this location is good. And like I said, Ive never had any food related issues, which is more than I can say about a lot of other locations.",4 years ago,2019-12-02 21:56:04.595702,,,,1,37,6,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105626988273326663839/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,
