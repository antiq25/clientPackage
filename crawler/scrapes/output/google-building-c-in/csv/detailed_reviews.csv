Light is the gas that fuels the time in our universes space. Solar alignment is our GPS since they dictate specific times in the space-time continuum. Gravitational lensing proves you can bend light. If you can bend the light of space-time then you can obviously warp space-time to create wormholes for time travel so light can jump across the lights fibonacci sequence that exists inside of the universes PI. Since time is light and light never ages its infinite life is a circle. Light exists at the beginning of time throughout the middle of time and at the end of time all at the same time.
