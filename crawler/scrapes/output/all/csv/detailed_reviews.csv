The first time I walked in I was greeted with a friendly smile by the super helpful reception team. They were able to book an appointment time that worked for me, given my busy schedule. And when I came in for my appointment they recognized me and greeted me by my name. How awesome is that? It really felt like a warm personal welcome. The clinics are always clean, and the place looks so modern. All the equipment there looks new and the technology used in some of these are pretty slick. The dentist who was assigned to me was named Howard. I cant say enough of his professionalism and respect. He works with his patients to ensure they have all the information to make the best decision with regards to the treatment plan or procedure.

The owner is definitely the sweetest thing in the shop as all their pastries are made with low sugar. After hearing its my first time there, the owner was so enthusiastic to introduce to me what they have and giving me a couple of samples to try. It was a very heart warming gesture. First the baklavas, the sweetness is only about 1/2 or less than the other baklavas out there, I can finally taste the true taste of the baklavas without filling my mouth with syrup. My husband absolutely loves it. My absolute favorites in the shop is the sesame cake and the dates pastry. Sesame cake tastes really fragrant and addictive. You dont get sick and tired of the taste at all. The texture is more like a cookie. The date pastry is quite different from the other places Ive tried and definitely my second choice from the shop. The orange chocolate cookie is another must have if you are a chocolate person. Its got such a strong dark bitter chocolate taste to it youll feel like youre eating dark chocolate itself. The texture was also really good. It has a combination of cookies and brownies texture making it nice and moist but still crunchy. Everything is priced by weight (baklava costs more). I think on average, each pc will cost around $1. This place is a bit out of my way, but with this quality, Im ok to make a trip there more often now",a year ago,2022-12-01 01:35:10.918899,"Dear Lucy, Thank you for your kind words.

We had seen the sign up for several months and were curious to know what would be opening in this unprepossessing space on the drive. We happened to walk by the other day and they were open, so we ventured in. Its a tiny bakery run by some lovely and friendly Syrians, with a selection of fresh Syrian breads and baklava. We asked some questions, which were answered enthusuastically and we bought a bag of their freshly baked flatbreads (Samoon) and an assortment of their pastries. They also gave us a small bag of bonus bread. It was their opening day, which can sometimes mean things go wrong. Not here! The flatbreads were great. Light and airy - perfect with falafels or charcuterie - whatever you like. The star of the show, however, is the pastries. The baklava is light, crisp, fresh and not too sweet or drowned in syrup, which is all too common, especially at Persian bakeries. There were also the most delicious sesame squares and date pastries. Try them all - nothing was disappointing. If they keep this standard up, they deserve to be very successful. They have opened in a difficult spot, but they deserve support and we will return there next time we are on Victoria Drive. Grab some pastries and have them with some good coffee.

Ive never been a big fan of baklava because of the sweetness and, unfortunately, sometimes greasiness. Seeing so many excellent reviews of Kamos baklavas, I was actually excited to try it for myself. I was not disappointed. We got both types, the walnut and the pistachio. They are both amazing--just the right amount of sweetness and not greasy at all! Its so incredibly well done, flaky and buttery--these baklavas are not pastries they are art! We loved them so much the next day my husband ordered some to bring to work to share. Everybody loved them. The baklavas are so spectacular I almost forgot to mention their other sweets and the owner. The owner--Ive got to ask for his name next time--is super nice. As a first timer in the bakery, he offered to let us try anything were interested. We ended up trying almost everything and buying a whole bunch of different sweets. In total we got 12 baklavas and a small box of assorted cookies. We finished them in 3 days, just the two of us! They are lethal because you dont feel guilty eating them at all.

I would highly recommend the rose peach cake as its something I havent been able to get anywhere else and it tasted divine! The rest was sweet and tasted exactly as expected, especially the strawberry cake and the lychee black tea. Not to make that sound bad, theyre staples in every store for a reason (they never miss)!! Though, not going to lie, wasnt a huge fan of the honeycomb in my dalgona latte as it was too sweet and it was slightly unnerving every time Id encounter its crunchy texture. Still drank it all, but probably wouldnt get it again... Other than that, the decor was nice and clean and the atmosphere was quiet and serene. Also, its a little on the expensive side... so definitely more of an experience than a regular hang-out spot. Hope the employees enjoyed the relaxing morning as it seemed like a slow shift (to be fair we went around brunch time on a Tuesday).

Nice little shop with cute interior decoration. Service was good. We were a bit confused to see the menu but the staff was explained to us very patiently. Friendly space to hang out with friends and family. Price is reasonable since can enjoy bubble tea and cake at the same time. After tasting the combo we both enjoyed their preset combination. Very unique, creative and aesthetic cup design. The peach cake is my favourite one and they sold out around 3pm today, Im glad to got it. I even ate too fast before I realized to take a picture! Rum cake can taste real rum flavour inside. They hide some raisin inside the cake to bring out the whole texture. Drinks used simple ingredients but very refreshing. I saw they were washing and cut fruits for preparation. I love to see business to use fresh ingredients to highlight their standard in food industry.

It is very creamy with subtle salty and sweet caramelized filling. Unfortunately when I bought the 8inch cake for my mothers birthday November 27, 2021, we discovered the cream in the centre was sour- like sour cream. This made the entire cake taste weird and off-putting . We called the next morning to ask the baker if they knew what happened, although they were not sure and had some hypothesis (maybe they forgot to thin out the cream with fresh cream?) Minus Cake Boutique took ownership of their product and offered to refund (if we bring the cake back) or make a replacement cake. I purchased many times from Minus and a refund was not what I was looking for. I simply wanted to inform them about the quality of their item. There was no way my family could eat another whole  8inch cake (we hate wastage and were determined to carve the sour cream part out of the first cake and make do with what we had) so I suggested making a smaller 6inch one so that we could taste what the cake should taste like. Minus Cake Boutique delivered and we picked up the remade cake and I am grateful and super happy to say, it tasted just the way we remembered it to be. Thank you very much for coming through with excellent customer service. We are very happy and will continue to buy your specialty cakes in the future.

Having drink and cake at the same time in one cup is definitely a game changer! At first I was a bit skeptical thinking of the combo would be too sweet but surprisingly it wasn t at all. Visited this place 2 times and my favorite combo is the peach slush and peach oreo cake.. the earl grey cake is pretty tasty too. Strawberry milk taste a bit bland but once you stir the strawberry compote well on the bottom..It s pretty amazing..the pear osmanthus drink was bit too light for my taste but my wife loved it..overall great place with friendly staff and great desserts!

Needless to say, both Professional Hazard and age has caught up to me and I need intense physiotherapy for my neck, shoulders, arms, hips and legs. Basically, a full overhaul of my joints, ligaments and muscles. I came to see my dear friend Krishna Jeeja at her MJ Physio clinic on Fraser St and 41st in Vancouver and started my treatment. I was quite nervous as asides from the few massages I have had with my wife at couples spas I have never been to any sort of therapy in this regard. Krishna completely made me feel at ease, explaining to me the details of my therapy and what was required. She made correct analysis on all of my problem joints in my body and exactly described my pain as if it was me talking. She is very knowledgeable on the workings of the human body. I feel an intense decrease in pain ever since Krishna started treating me, as a matter of fact I feel much better now than I have in years though I am aware it will take more than a few sessions to correct my body alignment. As I have been having intense pain in my ankle bones as well as my shoulders and neck Krishna was very quick in identifying the problem as bursitis. I assumed that only cortisol can treat this pain but I was hesitant of ever getting that treatment done. After Krishna told me they treat bursitis through laser  I am looking forward to getting laser treatment done in their Surrey location. I will recommend this place to anyone in need of physio. Krishna is kind hearted, professional, direct and an absolute joy to talk to. She is friendly and makes you feel at ease. Their facility has a nice gym, state of the art equipment and a very friendly receptionist. For the first time in my life I feel that I will get better and continue my work in music. Thank you Krishna and thank you MJ Physio for being there- and thank you for supporting the Arts in our city ( MJ Physio is one of our major sponsors for our Mushtari Begum Festival of Indian Classical Music and Dance) and selflessly donating your time to our Vancouver community.

This year I have fallen in love with Pickleball, playing almost everyday. The problem , playing outside on the hard court surface almost everyday,  it was giving me knee pain . My family doctor said it is arthritis in my knees and will have to ice and rest my knees every time I play.  Went for treatment with Ram . He checked me over and said with my range of motion ,I do not have arthritis . Ram gave me stretching exercises as well as IMS ( deep needle),muscle contraction and other Physio treatments . I can happily say my treatments were successful with no more Knee pain. I have been going for preventative treatment now every 2 - 3 weeks and still pain free playing Pickleball or Raquetball everyday .  I tell my story to anyone who has any sports pain. Ram gets my highest recommendation....Thanks so much Ram! posted 2019 : I was unsuccessful  with massage therapy  and chiropractors for my sports lower back pain.

It started with busstops, billboards, note pads  then one day I was driving down Kingsway and bam!!   right beside me is a 4 foot image on a car of Brandon! I went home and told my wife I think I found our realtor. I called Brandon and he came to our current home at the time and gave us a breakdown on market/value. He is very well spoken , confident , handsome young man and has his finger on the heartbeat of the market so we decided to list. We listed aggressively as he suggested and this fetched us multiple offers with our property going 80k over asking!! What a beauty! This was only one experience with Brandon. The second experience is a single family home in Montecito burnaby. I had fully renovated. Brandon showed up and fell in love with the place. I told Brandon  do you think we can get $2.5  we had purchased 1.5 years prior for $1.840 he said yeah l let s try! I believed that if anyone could fetch this number it would be him. Brandon had beautiful photos taken, drone shots, and a walk through video featuring,  yes! The one and only Brandon Gee Moore!! Brandon got us the number we wanted yet again for another huge win.

I felt that I had his undivided attention every step of the way, and he helped walk me through the negotiation, subjects, and helped explain what all the closing dates meant.

I was in my other residence for 16 years and was honestly overwhelmed by the thought of selling and then finding a place such that I thought someone like Brandon would be absolutely essential.  He was an incredibly honest and enthusiastic person from the beginning.  When it came to selling my home he had a collection of listings in the area presented in a binder so  quickly that I was amazed.  This prospectus enabled me to be realistic about what to list my home for and how to respond to changes in prices in the units around me.  He never pushed me to change my price but rather discussed the differences between units and what they were subsequently asking so that we could come to an effective solution with respect to my listing.  My place sold and I strongly believe that it was one of the few as the market dropped, and was directly related to his endless effort.  He guided me through the process of selling and then found the perfect place for me where I had really hoped I would end up very quickly!  He then expedited the buying process so that we were the first offer and we were able to buy the unit right away!!  In addition to all of this, he was a wealth of information regarding aspects related to moving out and moving in as he had a vast awareness of great people such as my Notary and movers.  Throughout this process he was always a step ahead of everyone and very effective in his actions.

Brandon Gee-Moore assisted me in the sale of a newer rental property condo near Brentwood in Burnaby, BC just before Christmas (2021), and I have rarely been as impressed with someone as I was with him. Brandon was a true professional from start to finish and is one of those rare breeds of people who actually does what he says he will. Not some of the time, but all of the time. And is humble and down to earth to boot. With an infectious, positive attitude, and fun to do business with. Every obstacle (and there were a few along the way) was met with a can-do attitude, and a solution that moved us all along. Brandon follows up leads on his website in a timely manner (to get your business, a good start), comes fully prepared to buyer or seller meet and greet meetings, and I found him to have excellent knowledge of current market conditions and current market selling prices. He uses good professionals (such as photographers), manages the showings and sales processes professionally, and closes win-win deals. In my case as a seller, we had three full price offers within a week (in the slow period of Nov 16-30 just before Christmas 2021), that all fell through for various reasons (financing turned down, etc). Not to worry, we got a fourth full price offer, and that sealed the deal. I enjoyed working with Brandon, and found him to be a true professional, and I would highly recommend him to any friends or associates, or others just looking for a good broker, on either the buying or selling side.

I can say this with confidence because of my experience with other realtors. First of all, Brandon truly cares about the service he provides. It is more than just a sale for him. He takes time in getting to know the client and what matters to them the most. He is not pushy which I appreciated a lot. However, if he thinks something is the right fit he will encourage you to move forward. For us, build quality was extremely important. Brandon understood that and he used his deep local knowledge and experience to guide us to find a home that was built well. There were many viewings we went to where we were willing to settle because we were tired of looking. Brandon stopped us from settling. There were offers that didnt go through and it was upsetting, but he didnt give up, and he kept us going. Brandon has lots of knowledge about the region, most of the local builders, and has access to insider information as he comes from a family of realtors. Brandon is professional and very approachable.

Unfortunately was told that they had no more ice and also was informed by the attendant that I would have a hard time finding some due to the heat wave. I was busy at the time getting the food and  supplies for my camping trip, now driving around finding ice was the last thing I wanted to do. So I decided to look up for companies that sell ice, to my surprise I clicked on this certain link and it caught my attention. The crazy thing about this is that the place was 20 meters away from my location. Feeling like a kid from a candy shop,  I had the choices of different type of ice I wanted. They explained to me the best type of ice to use cause I told them I was going camping. Using a block of ice to keep your food or beverage cold in a cooler goes goes way further than getting ice cubes on a bag. Found that out quickly when I was at the camp ground and that fellow friends ice were already melting and their coolers were filled with water. Very appreciated from their tips and the price of ice is a  way better deal than any local stores. They just deal with ice and the people or business that need it. Quick and simple.

All I needed was a self-administered swab tube.  Receptionist said they couldn t fit me in with a doctor. I don t need a doctor, I repeated several times.

Tell me I can t use their bathroom to do the self test, I would have to go somewhere else. I literally walk to the walk-in clinic next door who were more than happy to let me use their washroom to complete the test. I go to drop off the tube at LifeLabs, only to find they have given me the wrong tube. Great.

Given that I work about 10 mins away, I arrived approx 20 mins after the phone call and had to wait another  8-10 mins while the receptionist was on the phone with no acknowledgement. After she took my ID and set me up, I asked  her how long it will take for someone to meet me and she tells me that the doctor has gone on break and wont be back for another at least 30 mins and that there is someone else in front of me. I have no issue waiting my turn and am not upset by this at all. That was completely fair, I saw the women ahead of me waiting before I got there. When I tell the receptionist that I was under the impression there was no wait given what she had told me on the phone, she told me that since the doctor saw no one was there, he went on break. I am not saying that the doctor does not deserve a break but at least schedule the breaks or close the clinic for the 30 mins - 1 hour that break takes place. I have seen many clinics use this method and it works best. My issue is not with the doctor but the incompetent receptionist, given my friends experience, I will come by again for a consultation and we will see if this is an overall staff problem.",10 months ago,2023-02-01 01:36:02.356508,"Dear Stella, thank you for taking the time to leave your rating and concern.

I have had several personal trainers in the past from large corporate gyms and in comparison the level of detail and precision that goes into crafting these programs for clients are unmatched. I received a comprehensive spreadsheet of my workout split, a detailed training and nutrition guide alongside with progress photos. Harris utilizes a technical approach and can accurately pin point root causes of certain limited ranges of motions in various movements and exercises which has helped me immensely in reaching my fitness goals. I came into the beginning of my sessions with shoulder pain and Harris incorporated rehab exercises to alleviate the pain and and now it is completely gone.

Everyone I have met so far is friendly and professional. I have been training here for over two months and am so impressed with my PT, Preston. Having been a member of larger, corporate gyms before, I was a bit hesitant on joining a boutique gym but due to the covid situation, I thought I would try a session. As a busy mom, I really dont have too much time to train on my own.  After meeting my PT, I knew this gym would be a good fit for me.  Preston made sure I maximized my training time doing workouts that he tailored to my training goals and lifestyle.  He is very knowledgeable and encourages me to work harder and better. In addition to our workouts, he would give me advice on nutrition and daily exercise habits. I wouldnt have been able to achieve the progress that I have made so far without my PT. I was so surprised to see myself in the mirror with a barbell and weights in such short time! Instead of dreading to go to the gym, I am now looking forward to it.

As an individual, Sarah is one of the kindest people I have ever met. She s such a genuine person who really cares about people, which made it so easy for me to connect with her instantly. As a trainer, she listens to what your fitness goals are and really caters to that. She pays attention to your pains/limitations and works towards healing those (I work at a desk all day and she really worked on trying to reverse that damage). She takes time to make sure you re all warmed up, massages out any tight muscles from prior workouts, and switches workouts up often to make sure you re avoiding that plateau. What I love about her is how much importance she gives the mental aspect of working out along with the physical. The progress that I saw within even 3 weeks was incredibly rewarding. She puts you through a very comfortable level of discomfort and isn t one of those trainers who you dread going to because of how intense it is.

I was skeptical at first because I believed my training was sufficient. Boy was I wrong.

I m 25 but felt like I was 85 since I had back problems. Thankfully working Ken has allowed me to pinpoint my back issues, but that s not the point. THE POINT IS, the most rewarding experience I ve had is learning to maintain my lifestyle while still being in track and getting in shape.I thought I was smart about these things but turns out I m not. ALSO, KEN WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND trying to fit everything into my schedule, the number of workouts per week as well finding food that I liked but fit within my macros. I m not kidding I m legit busy all the time and not going to lie, I wasn t holding my end of the bargain. Ken was so nice and understanding but made sure I knew why training and being healthy was important. Honestly, everyone should invest in one of the personal trainers because really, it s an investment in yourself. You can tell they put a lot of work in the company.

Theyre supposed to be a walk-in clinic, but whenever I walk in, they dont have any vets available.  Either theyre not there or busy for the next 1-2 hours.  Fine, so I tried calling in for an appointment before going.  Appointment confirmed by the front desk, then I must have gotten 2-3 calls asking me to reschedule for various reasons. Finally settled on an appointment, then I go in and I still have to wait a long time to be seen.  Every other time I had to make an appointment and every time I had to wait 15-30 mins. Then there were the issues with the food.  I was sold a bag of prescription food that expired within a month of the purchase date, but I didnt know until I got home.  I asked to return it, but I was told they had a no return policy.  They said I was told that I was buying almost expiring food and was given a discount.  I was not told this, and the invoice didnt note this either.  Finally spoke to a manager and had to settle for a credit for half the amount. Another issue with food, I was quoted one price over the phone and when I went in to pay for it, they raised the price.  My dog needed it, so I couldnt say no...  Not happy. The vets there are good though, and attentive...  So it seems the issues really are from the front desk staff only.

I saw the reviews for Vancouver East Veterinary Walk-In Clinic so we booked our cat in here. Sadly, this was a huge mistake on our part. We took our cat in for her annual checkup. All of the documents were transferred from our previous vet to this one, so it should have her up to date vaccine information and other health background. Unfortunately, Dr. Shura didnt even pay attention to her vaccination history anyways, and despite our cat having gotten her 3-year vaccines in 2018, he said it was done in 2017 and then vaccinated her anyways. I didnt notice this until I got home and saw my previous invoices from the previous vet that said she last got the vaccination in 2018. A few days after we got home from the vet, my cats hair started falling out in the area where the vaccination was injected. We tried calling Vancouver East Veterinary Walk-In Clinic on Wednesday at around 10AM and there was no pick-up (they are closed most of the week, open only for limited hours in the afternoon), no voice mail, and no emergency line you can call. We ended up having to drive back to our old vet to get her looked at because that was our only option. I understand that adverse side effect may happen after a vaccination, but I am very disappointed that the vet misread her vaccination history and gave her something she didnt need, and also we werent able to reach them or an alternate number. When we were getting our cat looked at, Mr. Shura said to us that he doesnt like to overvaccinate animals because hell get our money through teeth cleanings anyways (he had recommended a teeth cleaning for our cat).

Your reception staff must disclose to all patients that there is a $50 no show fee even for phone call appointments. To force someone to pay this fee after a phone call was missed for legitimate reasons ESPECIALLY when it was not disclosed upon booking is borderline robbing. Please reconsider your policy surrounding phone vs. in-person appointments and/or re-train reception staff to be more considerate of patients circumstances. It seems they can greatly benefit from a lesson in using discretion. Not every patient visits the clinic frequently enough to see the notices for themselves. It is the job of the front desk receptionists to make policies transparent. Such a shame to have encountered hostility from your staff after so so many years of being a patient (my entire life so far to be exact...). To expect us to constantly bend our equally busy schedules to fit into the odd schedules of all the doctors here is impractical and a quick way to lose patients. I am starting to think I am better off finding a different practice to seek health care. The current front desk team is truly mediocre at their job at best. Edit: reply received and read.

When our patients book appointments, we expect them to be committed to the time they booked. If our patients are unable to make it to the time they booked, they are welcome to call in and adjust their appointment 24 hours before their booked time. If our patients have an emergency or a legitimate reason, we usually waive the no show fee and end with a warning. Phone appointments are just as important as in-person appointments, which is why there is a no show fee for phone calls as well. If you still have any questions or concerns, please email us at info@forwardcaremedical.com and we will assist you the best of our abilities.

As a patient I was very discouraged to ask questions and I didn t feel like to keep conversation with her. There WERE times She didn t called me on time, or met me when in-person meeting(which I understood since she could be busy). But she was very impatient and even aggressive when I couldn t received her call on time when I was really sick. She called  7 times in a row  in total to me and my husband which I think is not necessary (she probably want us to receive the call so that she can yell) and said, we d better find another dr if we keep doing this. It sounded almost like a threat. I wish I could recorded the phone call I had with her. If you have a baby, don t take them to her since she seems she doesn t know how to treat with a little one. My baby was literally freaked out whenever getting a shot from her. It was horrible experiences as a parent, but since it s hard to find a dr so I kinda made compromise to keep her as my dr. Now I regret myself being too patient with her and didn t find another dr more earlier. Hopefully nobody had or will have experiences like me.

Convenient location on the upper floor of Marine Gateway Hub. Operates Monday to Friday. Lovely and professional staff who remain patient, helpful and composed during this unusually difficult time. Our family is seen and treated by Dr Vasquez who has brilliant reviews on Rate My MD (not at all surprising). We have also seen Dr Cubra on occasion when Dr Vasquez has been away. Both doctors are incredibly patient, empathetic, and knowledgeable with relationships to other fantastic specialists in the community. Dr Vasquez is hardly ever late for an appointment - sometimes he is a few minutes early. On the rare occasion I have waited an additional 5-10 minutes but this is a far departure from our previous GP. I can t believe had become accustomed to waiting 1 hour + elsewhere. When this clinic moved into our neighbourhood a few years ago, I happened to ask the receptionist which doctor I should see and they told me that ALL of them were amazing.

You initially requested a weekend appointment a few months ago, and we were, unfortunately, unable to accommodate your ask as it fell outside our hours of operation. I did, however, still help you the best I could by locating another clinic near you as an alternative. Your request and my subsequent email correspondences occurred during a brief period when we experienced difficulties with our email server, something for which I apologized for at the time. As I am sure you know, it is an unfortunate reality that technology does not always work the way we expect it should despite our best efforts. When you spoke with my colleague last week requesting an appointment, she informed you of our clinic policy which requires new patients to present to the clinic by walk-in for their first visit. I am afraid you may have confused these two different exchanges, which occurred nearly eight months apart, as one occurrence, one of which was not your own. Nevertheless, I feel it is important to offer insight into any misconceptions you may still have about how a medical clinic, specifically our clinic, operates so that you are better informed in the future when trying to access care. The foundation of a walk-in clinic operates on the principle that a patient may present to a clinic without an appointment to access urgent or time-sensitive medical care on the same day. This concept will cease to exist in its practical sense if there is an expectation that clinics should schedule appointments in advance. Moreover, scheduling appointments ahead of time in a walk-in setting will make it extremely difficult for patients in need of urgent care to receive timely care. With that said, we also recognize that,  for a number of people, an appointment system is more ideal due to personal or professional commitments. For this reason, we operate as a hybrid by offering both walk-in and appointment services so that we may better accommodate everyone. To ensure we can accomplish this successfully, a number of different policies have had to be implemented to organize how and when each service can be rendered. One such policy is that new patients are required to present to the clinic by walk-in for their first appointment. This allows us to validate a new patients information, and ensure they are adequately informed of our clinic policies. While we acknowledge that not everyone will be agreeable to this caveat, it has ultimately allowed us to increase access to care for patients by drastically reducing our no-show rate so we may use resources, such as physician time, more efficiently. Therefore, although we are a business and some of our policies may not always equate to good business acumen, we feel it would be unethical to compromise the quality of care and access to medical services by operating as though healthcare is about commerce rather than the health and well-being of people. I hope the information above can help you understand the events that lead up to your experience, but should you need further clarification for our clinic procedures, I would be happy to address your concerns, so please do not hesitate to contact me.

Pre-Covid, when my mother in law had some dizzy episodes on a Saturday, we call the office, they fit her in with another doctor in the office and follow up with a letter to Emergency. Currently, they do either phone appointments or in office appointments and most times when we are in the phone appointment, if the doctor needs to see what is concerning (a rash, take blood pressure, etc.), they do their best to find time to let you come in, luckily for us it was within the same day. They referred my mother in law for a geriatrician, and Dr Zhang is also located in the same office. Very efficient in communication and coordination. Before the Geriatrician appointment, the staff called us twice with reminders. I appreciate the calls and reminders. The online booking is the only negative.

Besides being closer to my home, it is inferior in every way to the old clinic I would go to. The staff, while friendly, are mostly unhelpful and refuse basic things (like calling a taxi for patients). The clinic itself is small and youre forced to make appointments and referrals with 10~ people a couple steps away. Anything you ask the staff or talk to the staff about, everyone will hear. This clinic also doesnt allow you to leave messages outside of clinic hours and doesnt have a voicemail system set up at all, making it impossible to cancel or reschedule appointments if youre sick or outside a normal business hours routine. With the state of healthcare in Vancouver you dont really get much of a choice in where you see a family doctor, but if you do have a choice I would recommend against going to a doctor that works at this clinic.",6 years ago,2017-12-01 01:36:23.966897,,,,15,1,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100482003354046349939/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

Secondly I ve found myself waiting at the front desk waiting to be checked in while the group of girls finish a conversation about what they did on the weekend. Then I had an appointment today in the pm and they ve known since at least 8am they will be closed due to snow but choose to call me from a blocked number an hour before to short cancel my appointment. This appointment has already been moved two times. Lastly, when I called to ask a question about blood work one of the front end girls gave me the wrong information and again two weeks of my time has been wasted.

Nikki briefly spoke of how some of these cats as well as dogs,  had been treated prior to her stepping in and rescuing them and about how the pandemic and natural disasters have increased the poor faith of these vulnerable animals.  She really cares for animals.  She is defiantly a cat lady through and through. The work she does for these animals is incredible. I don t know what will happen to all the animals in the b.c in distress when she retires. Although I can t see her retiring bc she cares too much about animals being treated badly. Weather it be an issue of hoarding, owners on substances and or natural disasters. As well as her program for seniors she is right on it. We often get caught up in our busy lives and  forget about animals and there well being.  If you can t adopt a cat from Nikki please consider sponsoring a cat or make a donation.

She s absolutely wonderful.",10 months ago,2023-02-01 01:36:41.696900,,,,0,5,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116161470950164433577/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

Our eldest son was there for four years and just left for kindergarten and our youngest is still there. Arzoo has been such a gift for our family. Our boys have received so much love, care, and learning. Arzoo fills their days with activities and art and makes sure that they play outside every day. They never want to leave when I pick them up! We are so lucky that Arzoo chose us.

ChIJVVUx-4N2hlQRHrmfBsodWaI,Pretty In Pink Management Inc.,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlc01HWHh3RRAB,Courtney Kalman,1,"We hired pretty in pink management to tend bar at our wedding this past weekend and it was Andrea. We had a terrible experience. I hope no other bride has to deal with this company. First, she showed up late even though we had discussed her arriving early to set up before the wedding reception. We had a line up of people at the bar with no bartender before she even arrived. She also said she was arriving with a complete bar set up with cups and martini shakers as our signature drink was a martini. Andrea did not bring nearly enough cups to the event and was telling guests to keep their plastic cups. She was free pouring all the martinis and was not even using all the ingredients that were laid out for her. The biggest issue we had was we agreed on either a prepaid tip in advance or a tip jar. We decided on a prepaid tip from us so our wedding guests would not have to tip. Andrea asked us how she would approach guests who wanted to tip her anyways. We simply told her to tell guests that the bride and groom were taking care of gratuity. This is not uncommon at all with weddings, and was already agreed upon in an email that we would pay the tip in advance. She then took tips throughout the night and ended up leaving with a large tip jar including multiple bills.. we had a toonie bar. I can t help but assume she took money from our cash made from the bar and helped herself. I am only writing this review because this was one of the most important days of our lives and we feel so taken advantage of. Such unprofessional and shady service and I hope no other bride has to deal with this company or wage their money on this terrible experience. I asked for my original tip back and was ignored. I hope other brides read this and DO NOT HIRE this company.",a year ago,2022-12-01 01:36:42.229098,,,,3,2,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103357533532029428294/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,
