I still recommend him as a doctor, but my frustration is with his Front Counter Receptionists as I had a missed call from J-Von Medical, but a patient cannot return a call or email them (I tried several times, unsuccessfully)!  In the past, Ive been able to book online and speak with Dr. GILL. However, even though I am an Existing patient, the on-line system wont accept my email (same one I have had for 20 years!) I had to contact Vancouver General Hospital to try and get a message to my Doctor...who I have not heard back from in weeks! I was sent the email by the Doctor to get in touch with this medical clinic, yet it is the very same email that I have received messages  directly from J-Von Medical that states: Do Not email to this address as messages will Not be answered!",

The medical office assistants recently gave me a call to book for check up in person appointment was very efficient. With added booking online for virtual appointments made it easier for me have more regular doctor check ups as I am not required to wait long walk in times. And when I did have to go into the clinic I felt exceptional safe with all the Covid protocol the office had. Only complain I had was that during my short visit there, some possible wait in patients did try to barge in while being very rude to the office assistants. Its not something that clinic have control over, but during pandemic time, its truly sad that people are not more understanding of protocols.",

Let me give you a few examples: 1) While the clinic my cousin goes to regularly refused to refer him  to a gastroenterologist, J-Von did it timely and soon he had the endoscopy and colonoscopy done; 2) While the clinic my cousin goes to never called him after receiving the endoscopy and colonoscopy results, J-Von called as soon as they received the fax and booked him immediately for a follow-up to give him peace of mind; 3) After J-Von prescribed my mother a new drug, J-Von called us a few days later for a follow-up. Besides, Dr. Zong, a young doctor, has up-to-date knowledge and is English-Mandarin bilingual. I want to ask you: How many clinics would go that far to do these? None! If you had an unpleasant experience here and if it is all trivia (like with the receptionists, etc.), come on, have some patience and give it more time! It cant be wrong.",

If I dont like one, I just dont go there anymore. And if I find one thats satisfactory, I will stay there. Im guessing most people are like me. And once in a while (if youre lucky) you will come across a clinic that goes above and beyond your expected level of service and knowledgeable staff. Such is the case with J-VON Medical and Dental. They have set a new standard of what customer service should be. They also have a very well trained team of medical experts and dental professionals. The first time I walked in I was greeted with a friendly smile by the super helpful reception team. They were able to book an appointment time that worked for me, given my busy schedule. And when I came in for my appointment they recognized me and greeted me by my name. How awesome is that? It really felt like a warm personal welcome. The clinics are always clean, and the place looks so modern. All the equipment there looks new and the technology used in some of these are pretty slick. The dentist who was assigned to me was named Howard. I cant say enough of his professionalism and respect. He works with his patients to ensure they have all the information to make the best decision with regards to the treatment plan or procedure. I highly recommend this medical/dental clinic because of the friendly knowledgeable staff, exceptional service, and highly trained professionals. And on top of that, they are so conveniently located next to Metrotown Station and super clean and modern.",

I saw almost every doctor in the clinic, and the doctors and receptionists all very polite and helpful. I regularly visit this office because I have to review my INR result every week. I feel like a home while I am in the office.   I saw a few unpleasant patients. When they could not get what they want, so they went to the internet and wrote something not nice. I had been visiting a few clinics in my life, and I think J-Von medical is the best. I would strongly recommend going there and check up.",

You keep saying never coming back but do you? like the one called smashing, look at you, and like to destroy the world I guess. You are not good people!  I can tell the clinic if you show your real names I can report to them who you really are. I understand people may have a bad day, but keep your postings professional. Some of days, they can be slow, and some of the bad reviews I understand because of the timing or other things may not be perfect. I understand the other reviews, But for  Dan D, Ana.L, Onecouver, smashing, Minsi C. and V V and Z Z. You are a joke!  First, you are mean people and you have a bad life. Your life is a mass so you like to complain. Second, you still want to come back and use their resources because they are nice and you just cannot keep your mouth shut. You are not happy, just because of that, your lips have to move and fingers have to type to let your anger out. Third, you are not brave, you worried because people like me maybe reporting you to the clinic so you never can take advantage of this clinics convenient location. I am their neighbor and I go to their clinic since day one. I am a housewife and I appreciate this clinics professionalism. Donot be mean and post things not even truthful. I am not planning to go any clinics only to this one!",

I got to meet the owner, Kamo himself. Such a nice guy! He immediately knew that it was my first time and he gave a me a piece of their Baklava for free AND I LOVED IT! It was my first time and Ive only seen baklavas on TV.   It was so good! Ive had my eyes fixed on their pistachio cookies and bought a couple to take home. It was indeed a positive experience for me! Ill definitely be back to try the rest of their selections! If I could give 6 stars here, I would! EDIT: Added pictures on the review",

I have tried some baklava, kenafa and pastry with dates. It is delicious, lightly sweetened as I prefer. There a variety of flavours and options to choose from. I had a mix box. In addition, the bread is fresh and tasty. It will go well with cheese either breakfast or dinner. My taste buds asked for more!! Highly recommended to try Kamo Bakery!!",

Also dont sleep on the pistachio cookies - they taste like pistachio Nutella and melt in your mouth when consumed with your choice of milk. The owner is also super friendly, happy to explain what the different types of baklava are and proud of his baked goods. Definitely makes me happy to support and glad theyre not too far away so I can drop by a sweet treat.",

Super nice and friendly man (thank You!!) said he can make a box of mixed baklava, and that he will also put a small gift to try - Royal Paklava - it was soooo good, a lot of flavourful filling, not too sweet, it is PERFECT Walnut & Pistachio Baklavas also well balanced in flavors and structure, the top is perfectly crispy, great filling, soft inside, sweetness level is perfect for me (most baklavas I tried in Vancouver before were super sweet and had less filling so couldn t even notice nuts flavour).

Ive had Baklava before and they sell something similar called, Paklava. I was hesitant to try it because the baklava I had was sticky, chewy and way too sweet. He said, ours is different. Im so glad I tried it. It was absolutely delicious. It was crispy, buttery and not cloyingly sweet. Delicious!!! I ended up buying 6 pieces that day. They also had pomegranate molasses. I bought a bottle of that too. I cant wait until they have Knafeh. He said they will have it soon. EDIT: I went to this bakery again and the service is consistently friendly and welcoming. I love their Walnut Paklava. I bought a pound of it this time. I am also in love with their breads and orange cookies.",

                "review_text": "Everything the other review says are right! The owner is definitely the sweetest thing in the shop as all their pastries are made with low sugar. After hearing its my first time there, the owner was so enthusiastic to introduce to me what they have and giving me a couple of samples to try. It was a very heart warming gesture. First the baklavas, the sweetness is only about 1/2 or less than the other baklavas out there, I can finally taste the true taste of the baklavas without filling my mouth with syrup. My husband absolutely loves it. My absolute favorites in the shop is the sesame cake and the dates pastry. Sesame cake tastes really fragrant and addictive. You dont get sick and tired of the taste at all. The texture is more like a cookie. The date pastry is quite different from the other places Ive tried and definitely my second choice from the shop. The orange chocolate cookie is another must have if you are a chocolate person. Its got such a strong dark bitter chocolate taste to it youll feel like youre eating dark chocolate itself. The texture was also really good. It has a combination of cookies and brownies texture making it nice and moist but still crunchy. Everything is priced by weight (baklava costs more). I think on average, each pc will cost around $1. This place is a bit out of my way, but with this quality, Im ok to make a trip there more often now",

What sets this gem apart is its commitment to using only the finest, most authentic ingredients, giving every item a distinct and genuine flavor.  Their Pistachio and Walnut Baklawas, alongside the irresistible Kulicha, exude a tantalizing blend of honey and organic butter, unveiling a taste that is simply unparalleled. Since my first encounter with their treats a few months ago, I find myself unable to satisfy my cravings anywhere else. Kamos devotion and unwavering integrity to his craft truly sets this bakery apart. Kamo definitely deserves all the praise for his honesty and integrity in his work.",

We had seen the sign up for several months and were curious to know what would be opening in this unprepossessing space on the drive. We happened to walk by the other day and they were open, so we ventured in. Its a tiny bakery run by some lovely and friendly Syrians, with a selection of fresh Syrian breads and baklava. We asked some questions, which were answered enthusuastically and we bought a bag of their freshly baked flatbreads (Samoon) and an assortment of their pastries. They also gave us a small bag of bonus bread. It was their opening day, which can sometimes mean things go wrong. Not here! The flatbreads were great. Light and airy - perfect with falafels or charcuterie - whatever you like. The star of the show, however, is the pastries. The baklava is light, crisp, fresh and not too sweet or drowned in syrup, which is all too common, especially at Persian bakeries. There were also the most delicious sesame squares and date pastries. Try them all - nothing was disappointing. If they keep this standard up, they deserve to be very successful. They have opened in a difficult spot, but they deserve support and we will return there next time we are on Victoria Drive. Grab some pastries and have them with some good coffee. Heaven!",

Seeing so many excellent reviews of Kamos baklavas, I was actually excited to try it for myself. I was not disappointed. We got both types, the walnut and the pistachio. They are both amazing--just the right amount of sweetness and not greasy at all! Its so incredibly well done, flaky and buttery--these baklavas are not pastries they are art! We loved them so much the next day my husband ordered some to bring to work to share. Everybody loved them. The baklavas are so spectacular I almost forgot to mention their other sweets and the owner. The owner--Ive got to ask for his name next time--is super nice. As a first timer in the bakery, he offered to let us try anything were interested. We ended up trying almost everything and buying a whole bunch of different sweets. In total we got 12 baklavas and a small box of assorted cookies. We finished them in 3 days, just the two of us! They are lethal because you dont feel guilty eating them at all. Its a joy to discover small neighbourhood gems like Kamo. It makes you appreciate the little things in life that much more.",

I would highly recommend the rose peach cake as its something I havent been able to get anywhere else and it tasted divine! The rest was sweet and tasted exactly as expected, especially the strawberry cake and the lychee black tea. Not to make that sound bad, theyre staples in every store for a reason (they never miss)!! Though, not going to lie, wasnt a huge fan of the honeycomb in my dalgona latte as it was too sweet and it was slightly unnerving every time Id encounter its crunchy texture. Still drank it all, but probably wouldnt get it again... Other than that, the decor was nice and clean and the atmosphere was quiet and serene. Also, its a little on the expensive side... so definitely more of an experience than a regular hang-out spot. Hope the employees enjoyed the relaxing morning as it seemed like a slow shift (to be fair we went around brunch time on a Tuesday). Tldr, worth it to try the rose oolong peach cake and experience the fun of the stacking cake cups.",

                "review_text": "Visited this place with my wife on labour day. Nice little shop with cute interior decoration. Service was good. We were a bit confused to see the menu but the staff was explained to us very patiently. Friendly space to hang out with friends and family. Price is reasonable since can enjoy bubble tea and cake at the same time. After tasting the combo we both enjoyed their preset combination. Very unique, creative and aesthetic cup design. The peach cake is my favourite one and they sold out around 3pm today, Im glad to got it. I even ate too fast before I realized to take a picture! Rum cake can taste real rum flavour inside. They hide some raisin inside the cake to bring out the whole texture. Drinks used simple ingredients but very refreshing. I saw they were washing and cut fruits for preparation. I love to see business to use fresh ingredients to highlight their standard in food industry. Very pleasing experience for afternoon snack, will definitely go back again with our children to try their other products!",

I got the seasonal coconut taro ube cake with the mango sago coconut slush. The cake was not too sweet and a perfect light summer cake. The slush paired well as it was not too sweet. My friend and I both got drinks and found them less sweet then we were expecting. For me, I found this a pleasant surprise, but she got a matcha drink and didnt like it as much. So, if you are expecting or wanting a bubble tea level of sweetness, might want to check with the staff about which drinks are sweet. The service was quick (much quicker than bubble tea usually) and I would love to come back and try more flavour combos.",

You can easily devour the delectable   and immediately go for a sip of the  , rinse and repeat   Wonder if someone patented that design because it s just genius and perfect for devouring on the run Had the  cake + lychee iced tea combo with zero sugar and boy this combo was super yum! Cake was sweetened just right and took me back to my childhood when I gorged on Melona treats, but this was better! The Lychee tea had really refreshing fruit bits, this combo is solid! Also tried the   raspberry   cake + hawthorn dates refresher with zero sugar and this was fab too. Now here s my 2 cents on the pricing of the 2 dessert combo - it s pretty fair y all! First we typically pay $7 for a decent cake anyway and also another $7 for a good quality non powdered bbt (you know what I m talking about) and this place is a one-stop shop for you to address your need for a little something nice and sweet. Would I come back again, you bet!",

Left: blackcurrant rum raisin cake with lychee slush Mid: chocolate cake with Oreo slush Right: Earl Grey cake with dalgona latte *Edit: owner told me there is more street parking around the side, and a larger parking lot behind their building!

                "review_text": "Late Review We have ordered from Minus Cake Boutique for many festive occasions and our favourite cake is the Jasmine Pearl Lava Cake. It is very creamy with subtle salty and sweet caramelized filling. Unfortunately when I bought the 8inch cake for my mothers birthday November 27, 2021, we discovered the cream in the centre was sour- like sour cream. This made the entire cake taste weird and off-putting . We called the next morning to ask the baker if they knew what happened, although they were not sure and had some hypothesis (maybe they forgot to thin out the cream with fresh cream?) Minus Cake Boutique took ownership of their product and offered to refund (if we bring the cake back) or make a replacement cake. I purchased many times from Minus and a refund was not what I was looking for. I simply wanted to inform them about the quality of their item. There was no way my family could eat another whole  8inch cake (we hate wastage and were determined to carve the sour cream part out of the first cake and make do with what we had) so I suggested making a smaller 6inch one so that we could taste what the cake should taste like. Minus Cake Boutique delivered and we picked up the remade cake and I am grateful and super happy to say, it tasted just the way we remembered it to be. Thank you very much for coming through with excellent customer service. We are very happy and will continue to buy your specialty cakes in the future. Already eyeing another cake for our next festive celebration.",

Having drink and cake at the same time in one cup is definitely a game changer! At first I was a bit skeptical thinking of the combo would be too sweet but surprisingly it wasn t at all. Visited this place 2 times and my favorite combo is the peach slush and peach oreo cake.. the earl grey cake is pretty tasty too. Strawberry milk taste a bit bland but once you stir the strawberry compote well on the bottom..It s pretty amazing..the pear osmanthus drink was bit too light for my taste but my wife loved it..overall great place with friendly staff and great desserts! Def becoming my go to place!",

Im so happy I found it and Krishna! Ive been receiving concussion therapy for two months now and its like Im finally human again. I can walk, bike, and drive again, and my cognition and screen time tolerance is improving with the exercises. None of this was the case when I first started with Krishna. During my first session, Krishna quickly identified that my vision was affected by the concussion and that is the likely cause of my symptoms. It was a huge relief to understand why I was feeling so yucky and have a plan to fix it. Thank you so much!!!",

I should ve gone to my doc for a shot(which I found out later), but a week later, I went to MJ physio. She used ultrasound & tens machine to help heal. She told me about certain exercises that I should do to strengthen & stretching my glutes & hamstrings, as I wasn t in good shape to play golf. Doc said it d take 6-12 weeks, but I played my first golf 5 weeks after injury and I played better because I was more stronger in my core and glutes. I m still getting treatments b c of sore left shoulder & back and she s used shock therapy for shoulder and it has rapidly helped the shoulder. My back pain is also getting better. 6 weeks later now, I m playing golf better & I can run if I have to, btw, I m a newish senior. I m planning to check in with Krishna from time to time if I feel aches & pains. Thanks much, Krishna!",

                "review_text": "As an Indian Classical musician, I have been tirelessly working through sitting cross legged and playing my tabla for over 10 hours a day for 30 + years. Needless to say, both Professional Hazard and age has caught up to me and I need intense physiotherapy for my neck, shoulders, arms, hips and legs. Basically, a full overhaul of my joints, ligaments and muscles. I came to see my dear friend Krishna Jeeja at her MJ Physio clinic on Fraser St and 41st in Vancouver and started my treatment. I was quite nervous as asides from the few massages I have had with my wife at couples spas I have never been to any sort of therapy in this regard. Krishna completely made me feel at ease, explaining to me the details of my therapy and what was required. She made correct analysis on all of my problem joints in my body and exactly described my pain as if it was me talking. She is very knowledgeable on the workings of the human body. I feel an intense decrease in pain ever since Krishna started treating me, as a matter of fact I feel much better now than I have in years though I am aware it will take more than a few sessions to correct my body alignment. As I have been having intense pain in my ankle bones as well as my shoulders and neck Krishna was very quick in identifying the problem as bursitis. I assumed that only cortisol can treat this pain but I was hesitant of ever getting that treatment done. After Krishna told me they treat bursitis through laser  I am looking forward to getting laser treatment done in their Surrey location. I will recommend this place to anyone in need of physio. Krishna is kind hearted, professional, direct and an absolute joy to talk to. She is friendly and makes you feel at ease. Their facility has a nice gym, state of the art equipment and a very friendly receptionist. For the first time in my life I feel that I will get better and continue my work in music. Thank you Krishna and thank you MJ Physio for being there- and thank you for supporting the Arts in our city ( MJ Physio is one of our major sponsors for our Mushtari Begum Festival of Indian Classical Music and Dance) and selflessly donating your time to our Vancouver community. I give you 6/5 stars!",

The problem , playing outside on the hard court surface almost everyday,  it was giving me knee pain . My family doctor said it is arthritis in my knees and will have to ice and rest my knees every time I play.  Went for treatment with Ram . He checked me over and said with my range of motion ,I do not have arthritis . Ram gave me stretching exercises as well as IMS ( deep needle),muscle contraction and other Physio treatments . I can happily say my treatments were successful with no more Knee pain. I have been going for preventative treatment now every 2 - 3 weeks and still pain free playing Pickleball or Raquetball everyday .  I tell my story to anyone who has any sports pain. Ram gets my highest recommendation....Thanks so much Ram! posted 2019 : I was unsuccessful  with massage therapy  and chiropractors for my sports lower back pain. After one treatment with MJ Physio I felt less pain and could continue my gym and raquet sports workouts . After 4 treatment sessions I feel completely healed . Their treatments of IMS, massage , stretching , electrical contraction machine and an exercise regime has completely made my back 100 % better . Highly recommend Ram and his Partner to my family and friends if they have muscle / joint pain. Thanks MJ Physio for your excellent effective treatment for my lower back injury . I will not hesitate to call on you again if I have another injury.",

Brandon took consideration deeply to our need and our budget and can always provide us great listings. Our shopping lasted for 3 months and Brandon was always there with us for every visit. He shared us his honest opinions and can always pick up details we didnt notice. He answered us whenever we have questions regardless weekdays or weekends, daytime or nighttime. We eventually got this great deal in Metro Burnaby, which originally thought to be much more expensive. He made the whole completion process so smooth that we didnt had any trouble. Hes indeed Top 1% realtor. We greatly appreciate his hard work and professionalism.",

It started with busstops, billboards, note pads  then one day I was driving down Kingsway and bam!!   right beside me is a 4 foot image on a car of Brandon! I went home and told my wife I think I found our realtor. I called Brandon and he came to our current home at the time and gave us a breakdown on market/value. He is very well spoken , confident , handsome young man and has his finger on the heartbeat of the market so we decided to list. We listed aggressively as he suggested and this fetched us multiple offers with our property going 80k over asking!! What a beauty! This was only one experience with Brandon. The second experience is a single family home in Montecito burnaby. I had fully renovated. Brandon showed up and fell in love with the place. I told Brandon  do you think we can get $2.5  we had purchased 1.5 years prior for $1.840 he said yeah l let s try! I believed that if anyone could fetch this number it would be him. Brandon had beautiful photos taken, drone shots, and a walk through video featuring,  yes! The one and only Brandon Gee Moore!! Brandon got us the number we wanted yet again for another huge win. Now we had sold and we did not have a house to move to only a pocket full of cash. This is great but not when you have a pregnant wife and two other kids! He worked day and night until he found us our dream property. No wonder this guy is top 1% . If you can say Brandon you can say SOLD!",

He was always honest and transparent about the properties we looked at, and never tried to push us into making a decision. In fact, there were a few instances where he even advised us against putting an offer on a property. His knowledge of the Burnaby area and his reputation among other realtors was also a huge plus. He even provided references for me to speak with before hiring him, which gave me a lot of confidence in his expertise. Overall, I highly recommend Brandon for anyone looking to buy or sell a home. He truly went above and beyond to make sure we found the perfect property for our needs. Ask Brandon for my reference and I will be happy to talk more in detail.",

Over the course of those 3 years, Brandon was very patient and a huge help.  I often needed to tweek/change my email updates (eg. new budget, new neighbourhood, etc) as I learned more about Vancouver, and Brandon was very supportive and fast to make the changes. When I finally found the home I wanted to buy, Brandon again was very attentive and made the process easy and as stress-free as possible!  I felt that I had his undivided attention every step of the way, and he helped walk me through the negotiation, subjects, and helped explain what all the closing dates meant. I recommend Brandon to all my FTHB friends, even if they already have a realtor, becasue Brandon was fantastic.  We even got a beautiful welcome home basket which was above and beyond what we expected. Brandon, Ill see you soon for home #2!",

It is the care and kindness he acts with that sets him a part. He is in the top 1 percent of realtors for a reason! Not only is he very efficient and thorough in all details, but he genuinely cares about you and your family s needs. He understands the stresses of selling/purchasing a property and is very supportive of clients. Most realtors are all about the money and getting a sale. Brandon is different, he leads with his heart and treats you like family. He does this all while ensuring you also make the purchase of your dreams/sell in a way that you feel comfortable. This makes the experience so much more enjoyable and less stressful! I am very grateful to Brandon for such excellent service and care! I highly recommend Brandon for any property you are looking to buy or sell. If you want a kind, compassionate, efficient, and upbeat professional who will look after you, Brandon is for you! I will be returning to him and recommending him to all my friends and family!",

I was in my other residence for 16 years and was honestly overwhelmed by the thought of selling and then finding a place such that I thought someone like Brandon would be absolutely essential.  He was an incredibly honest and enthusiastic person from the beginning.  When it came to selling my home he had a collection of listings in the area presented in a binder so  quickly that I was amazed.  This prospectus enabled me to be realistic about what to list my home for and how to respond to changes in prices in the units around me.  He never pushed me to change my price but rather discussed the differences between units and what they were subsequently asking so that we could come to an effective solution with respect to my listing.  My place sold and I strongly believe that it was one of the few as the market dropped, and was directly related to his endless effort.  He guided me through the process of selling and then found the perfect place for me where I had really hoped I would end up very quickly!  He then expedited the buying process so that we were the first offer and we were able to buy the unit right away!!  In addition to all of this, he was a wealth of information regarding aspects related to moving out and moving in as he had a vast awareness of great people such as my Notary and movers.  Throughout this process he was always a step ahead of everyone and very effective in his actions.  But then theres the fact that he also was a very polite, caring and non-pressuring person that I could really relate to.  If you have the opportunity to work with Brandon, you will be another fortunate person indeed!!",

He always sent me new condo listings in my interest area (west Coquitlam and Burnaby). As a first-home buyer, I had many questions and he was very patient and responded very quickly.  During the whole process, he provided many professional tips/advice. I had a good experience and I would highly recommend him to anyone! Thank you for everything, Brandon!",

As any first-time home buyer can attest to, this can be an overwhelming and defeating process in what was a very aggressive sellers market at the time. When we did finally come across the one, which was slightly outside of our price range, Brandons approach to be firm yet patient during the negotiation stage paid off in our favour and we secured the property under asking. To this day, were still amazed that it worked out the way it did, and feel grateful to Brandon for making it happen. Brandons commitment to work for his clients, passion for the business, and likeable demeanor makes him a solid realtor for anyone looking to buy/sell their home. Highly recommend!",

Brandon Gee-Moore assisted me in the sale of a newer rental property condo near Brentwood in Burnaby, BC just before Christmas (2021), and I have rarely been as impressed with someone as I was with him. Brandon was a true professional from start to finish and is one of those rare breeds of people who actually does what he says he will. Not some of the time, but all of the time. And is humble and down to earth to boot. With an infectious, positive attitude, and fun to do business with. Every obstacle (and there were a few along the way) was met with a can-do attitude, and a solution that moved us all along. Brandon follows up leads on his website in a timely manner (to get your business, a good start), comes fully prepared to buyer or seller meet and greet meetings, and I found him to have excellent knowledge of current market conditions and current market selling prices. He uses good professionals (such as photographers), manages the showings and sales processes professionally, and closes win-win deals. In my case as a seller, we had three full price offers within a week (in the slow period of Nov 16-30 just before Christmas 2021), that all fell through for various reasons (financing turned down, etc). Not to worry, we got a fourth full price offer, and that sealed the deal. I enjoyed working with Brandon, and found him to be a true professional, and I would highly recommend him to any friends or associates, or others just looking for a good broker, on either the buying or selling side. My experience with Brandon was first class, 10/10, with no reservations.",

From the beginning, he acted so fast and dagged deeper by asking the right questions to learn about our preferences; soon after, he started sending listings based on our answers. He arranged the viewing for the selected listings and gave us the whole picture and information about each unit, and provided his real estate insights for each one of them. His insights were very valuable and crucial for us to decide which unit is going to be the most beneficial in the long term and ticks all the boxes for us at the current moment. During the offer stage, he was very thoughtful and knowledgeable, using the right strategies and tactics to present offers with fair negotiation that allowed us to get our dream unit BELOW the asking price, and this is all because of Brandon s experience in this hot market. Brandon was very patient, managed expectations very well, and kept us updated about each step of the process, and addressed and answered all of our questions and concerns.

Brandon is one of the most hardworking professionals I have ever worked with, he went above and beyond our expectations. I know that if we ever decide to sell in the future that we will be working with him again. Could not find a better realtor to work with!",

First of all, Brandon truly cares about the service he provides. It is more than just a sale for him. He takes time in getting to know the client and what matters to them the most. He is not pushy which I appreciated a lot. However, if he thinks something is the right fit he will encourage you to move forward. For us, build quality was extremely important. Brandon understood that and he used his deep local knowledge and experience to guide us to find a home that was built well. There were many viewings we went to where we were willing to settle because we were tired of looking. Brandon stopped us from settling. There were offers that didnt go through and it was upsetting, but he didnt give up, and he kept us going. Brandon has lots of knowledge about the region, most of the local builders, and has access to insider information as he comes from a family of realtors. Brandon is professional and very approachable. I truly believe if it wasnt for his knowledge and expertise we would have never been able to buy our home in a crazy competitive market like Burnaby!

Buying a home is very daunting but he definitely made it much easier for us. He is always quick to response, and patient.  Very knowledgeable too!  Do not get fooled by his young age.  He has tons of experience in the area.  And when it comes to price negotiation - lets just say we were very satisfied. Cannot recommend him more :)!",

As a first time home buyer, he educated us well with all the aspects of buying. He was very patient and didnt rush us into buying anything we didnt like. In fact he made us see many condos varying from old to new & also introduced us to new neighborhoods. This really made our purchase easy..Also I must say he was flexible with the tight work schedule we had and would book all the appointments per our schedule. In short, he was always on our side as a friend working to make our house purchase as simple and successful as possible. The best part about working with Brandon was that he was always more focused on answering our questions, giving us good advice & boost our confidence when we were hesitant in decision making. And finding condos that met our needs than he was on closing a deal. We would definitely recommend him to anyone",

While looking at properties, Brandon had my best interest in mind and did not hesitate to advise me of potential problematic issues during the viewings. He has a very pleasant disposition and I felt like I was taken care of throughout the entire process. I am confident in recommending Brandon to anyone who is in search of a top notch relator.

As first-time buyers, we changed our minds throughout the process. However, Brandon was extremely patient and understanding whilst providing objective advice and answering every question and concern that we had, no matter what time of day or night. He was never concerned about closing a deal; only about finding us the right home in the right neighbourhood for the right price. When we finally found our dream home, Brandon guided us through several rounds of negotiation until reached a price that we were both happy with. This made the whole process incredibly easy and stress-free. His honesty, expertise, exceptional advice, and attentiveness are greatly valued and appreciated. We would highly recommend Brandon to anyone looking to sell or buy a home.",

Most importantly Dex is always there when he says he will be. I highly recommend this company and their great service. Thanks for being Dang Good",

Unfortunately was told that they had no more ice and also was informed by the attendant that I would have a hard time finding some due to the heat wave. I was busy at the time getting the food and  supplies for my camping trip, now driving around finding ice was the last thing I wanted to do. So I decided to look up for companies that sell ice, to my surprise I clicked on this certain link and it caught my attention. The crazy thing about this is that the place was 20 meters away from my location. Feeling like a kid from a candy shop,  I had the choices of different type of ice I wanted. They explained to me the best type of ice to use cause I told them I was going camping. Using a block of ice to keep your food or beverage cold in a cooler goes goes way further than getting ice cubes on a bag. Found that out quickly when I was at the camp ground and that fellow friends ice were already melting and their coolers were filled with water. Very appreciated from their tips and the price of ice is a  way better deal than any local stores. They just deal with ice and the people or business that need it. Quick and simple. Know now and my friends where to go .",

Tong who are both amazing. They are amazing because they actually listened to what I was saying and helped me with no hesitation (you expect this from doctors but it is hard to come by).

I was sick for weeks and couldnt breathe and was staying up all night with a rattle in my chest. Walked in to this clinic, was seen right away with no wait time at all, and explained my situation to the doctor. She didnt say much, which at first I thought was off-putting, but I quickly realised she was doing her job properly and professionally. She assessed me, told me I had bronchitis and that I had gotten much worse since the other Dr. at another clinic had misdiagnosed my symptoms. She quickly prescribed me some antibiotics and an inhaler to help clear my chest. I felt better within a couple of days. If not for her I fear I may have gotten much worse. 10/10 would recommend this clinic, as the staff are competent and understanding. They arent customer service representatives, they are health-care professionals, and thats what I want when I see a doctor.",

I don t need a doctor, I repeated several times. I just needed a tube for a self-administered test. They said I needed a requisition. I already have a requisition. They take it, grab a tube for me. Tell me I can t use their bathroom to do the self test, I would have to go somewhere else. I literally walk to the walk-in clinic next door who were more than happy to let me use their washroom to complete the test. I go to drop off the tube at LifeLabs, only to find they have given me the wrong tube. Great. EDIT: In response to the reply - new and training is one thing, but this receptionist was dismissive and patronizing. I had a simple request, and she made the interaction frustrating and I left in disbelief, unsure of what I had done to make her so angry with me.",

                "review_text": "I called in this morning to make an appointment for a botox consultation and the receptionist told me I had to come in right at that moment as there is no one waiting and they dont do appointments. Given that I work about 10 mins away, I arrived approx 20 mins after the phone call and had to wait another  8-10 mins while the receptionist was on the phone with no acknowledgement. After she took my ID and set me up, I asked  her how long it will take for someone to meet me and she tells me that the doctor has gone on break and wont be back for another at least 30 mins and that there is someone else in front of me. I have no issue waiting my turn and am not upset by this at all. That was completely fair, I saw the women ahead of me waiting before I got there. When I tell the receptionist that I was under the impression there was no wait given what she had told me on the phone, she told me that since the doctor saw no one was there, he went on break. I am not saying that the doctor does not deserve a break but at least schedule the breaks or close the clinic for the 30 mins - 1 hour that break takes place. I have seen many clinics use this method and it works best. My issue is not with the doctor but the incompetent receptionist, given my friends experience, I will come by again for a consultation and we will see if this is an overall staff problem.",

I loved the doctor I saw the first time, and have been back twice since. However, the receptionist ruins the experience and the way that the clinic runs makes it impossible to give this place a good rating. Their times listed are absolutely inaccurate. For example I was there today at 8:50am expecting the clinic to open at 9am. On the door they have no times posted, only online. The clinic finally opened at 9:30am. I walked in and the receptionist said they were not open for walk-ins as no doctors would be in today. I asked why that was not at least posted on the door, she replied theres nothing I can do. I told her that she could post something, even a piece of paper on the door with that information, or update their voicemail (of which they have none) Well at this point Ive taken the day off work, I still need to see a doctor, and all of the clinics are at least an hour wait time. I highly recommend staying away from this place.",

Friendly staff, clean and well organized gym with lots of equipments I have been trained by many personal trainers in my life but after meeting Ken, my new personal trainer, I have realized not all the trainers are the same. He really puts in effort and care towards his clients, very well organized, uses his experience and knowledge to help his clients reach their goals. Any trainers can push you to work out and do cardios, but Ken actually makes perfect work out/diet plans for each individual Highly recommended 10/10",

Everyone at the gym was kind and helpful especially my lovely trainer, Rachel. Rachel was tough at times, I used to call her evil, and very caring and attentive on the days I was feeling down. I enjoyed training with Rachel, I enjoyed the music she used to play for my sessions and I was very happy with the transformation I saw on my body after only 2 months of training. Also, I appreciate how Rachel was very understanding of my busy schedule and how she used to push me to keep coming to the sessions regularly. I am very happy with the results I achieved in the 6 months of training with Rachel and I would ve continued working with her if I didn t have to move out of town. All the best Rachel :)",

I have known David for several years and his energy is infectious. I dealt with bloating, hypothyroidism and iron deficiency while doing shift work which all lead to a decline in my health. I went from almost 130lbs of skinny fat to 114lbs of muscle. He has helped me obtain the physique Ive always wanted and the strength I never knew that I had. He s incredibly attentive, knowledgeable, and an overall genuine trainer and boxing coach.  His positive attitude and approachable nature makes me feel completely at ease. I cannot recommend David enough as he truly knows what he is doing and you will see how he genuinely cares about your goals. He radiates passion and dedication for his clients and I absolutely love training with him. He will make you succeed with your fitness goals. If youre seeking a trainer who will produce results and make you enjoy it at the same time - you have found the right place. My only regret is not starting with him sooner. I am so incredibly happy - Thank you David and the amazing Blk Box Team",

The tailored program at Blk Box actually made a difference and I could see how my body changed every single week; not to mention what a pleasure it was to work with Ken. He s extremely knowledgeable you can ask him anything training related and he would be able to answer you. He even helped me recovered from an old injury that prevented me from doing many of the movements. Every single trainer at the gym is friendly and has his/her own personality that you can fell in love with. His rate is also very reasonable comparing to other personal trainers.

Harris (my trainer) was incredibly knowledgable and friendly, and we got to know each other quite well over the several months that I trained there. Harris helped me understand that lifting wasnt just about heavy weights, and he was great at explaining how mobility, rest and nutrition played such a significant part in it as well. Though my time at BLKBOX has wrapped, Im really fortunate to be able to call Harris a good friend of mine now. One of my favourite things about BLKBOX is how I got to know all the other trainers as well. Its a really tight-knit team that are all super fun to be around and they dont make you feel intimidated or self-conscious to be there. Its a great community and I definitely miss being around that team on a weekly basis, and I would definitely reach out again if I were to need personal training once again!",

Shortly after I started all the trainers at the gym greeted me by name when I walked in to my sessions and I soon felt a connection to this community. My trainer, Matt, listened to my goals and created a program that set me up for success and I so enjoyed learning from him and his infectious passion and expertise for bodybuilding and nutrition. I look forward to working with him again in the future! Similarly, in hearing conversations between other clients and trainers it was clear that everyone had each others best interests in mind and were there to be kind and helpful. This is a fantastic premium fitness studio that truly has coaches and trainers for all levels and areas of fitness interest. I cant wait to go back and see the newly renovated facilities and continue to support this business!",

I have had several personal trainers in the past from large corporate gyms and in comparison the level of detail and precision that goes into crafting these programs for clients are unmatched. I received a comprehensive spreadsheet of my workout split, a detailed training and nutrition guide alongside with progress photos. Harris utilizes a technical approach and can accurately pin point root causes of certain limited ranges of motions in various movements and exercises which has helped me immensely in reaching my fitness goals. I came into the beginning of my sessions with shoulder pain and Harris incorporated rehab exercises to alleviate the pain and and now it is completely gone. He also taught me how to effectively and properly breathe during my exercises and that has been an absolute game changer in my workout sessions. The value I have gained from my sessions with Harris has been incredible and I am now equipped with the knowledge and skills to maintain the physique I have built. I appreciate the professionalism from Harris and would highly recommend this personal training gym in Richmond.",

I have been training here for over two months and am so impressed with my PT, Preston. Having been a member of larger, corporate gyms before, I was a bit hesitant on joining a boutique gym but due to the covid situation, I thought I would try a session. As a busy mom, I really dont have too much time to train on my own.  After meeting my PT, I knew this gym would be a good fit for me.  Preston made sure I maximized my training time doing workouts that he tailored to my training goals and lifestyle.  He is very knowledgeable and encourages me to work harder and better. In addition to our workouts, he would give me advice on nutrition and daily exercise habits. I wouldnt have been able to achieve the progress that I have made so far without my PT. I was so surprised to see myself in the mirror with a barbell and weights in such short time! Instead of dreading to go to the gym, I am now looking forward to it. If you are looking to see results with friendly, professional and knowledgeable PTs, I would highly recommend BLK BOX.  My only complaint is that I havent seen Obi, the fur trainer lately. I always look forward to seeing him too!",

From my limited personal training history in Toronto and Vancouver, I would say this is my best experience so far. The gym is never crowded, which is great these days. Ken is super professional and very passionate about building a sustainable workout routine for me. I really enjoy many personalized stretch procedures that he carries out on me every session, to avoid injury and maximize performance. I had many great conversations with him too, although mostly on Tesla:)",

However, from the very first consultation with my trainer Sarah, I knew this was going to be the right fit for me. Not only is she kind and funny but Sarah is EXTREMELY caring and knowledgeable. Going to train with her was always the highlight of my day and I think that speaks volumes of the atmosphere created by Sarah and the other trainers. You can tell theyre like a little family and they make you feel like youre a part of it also. In my time there, not once did I ever feel out of place or intimidated. In fact, my confidence in lifting weights and going to a gym on my own grew significantly all thanks to Sarah. She really pays attention to detail and making sure you understand what youre doing and how to complete the exercises properly. Her dedication to her clients truly shows and Im lucky to have found a friend in her. I seriously cannot recommend her enough! TLDR: BLK Box is comprised of the sweetest individuals and my trainer Sarah is quite literally the best trainer you could ask for. Do yourself a favour and book a consultation with her ASAP!!",

As an individual, Sarah is one of the kindest people I have ever met. She s such a genuine person who really cares about people, which made it so easy for me to connect with her instantly. As a trainer, she listens to what your fitness goals are and really caters to that. She pays attention to your pains/limitations and works towards healing those (I work at a desk all day and she really worked on trying to reverse that damage). She takes time to make sure you re all warmed up, massages out any tight muscles from prior workouts, and switches workouts up often to make sure you re avoiding that plateau. What I love about her is how much importance she gives the mental aspect of working out along with the physical. The progress that I saw within even 3 weeks was incredibly rewarding. She puts you through a very comfortable level of discomfort and isn t one of those trainers who you dread going to because of how intense it is. She greets you with a smile and makes it an incredibly positive experience overall. All-in-all, she s amazing. Life has gotten in the way and I haven t been able to reconnect with her but hoping to do so again in the near future.",

From understanding nutrition plan, to weight training, to being there through tough days and best days. I started seeing results after few months. Not only had I the energy to train, run, be more active then I ever was, I was doing all of that pain free. Harry helped roll out and strengthen the muscles and made sure that every exercise was done in perfect form.

From the get-go, Sarah was results-driven and designed a custom workout program for me both at BLK BOX and at home (I own a home gym). On Day2 of training when she gave me an Excel spreadsheet of lifting homework to track progress, I knew she was my trainer!! I went from a pre-COVID deadlift PR of 135 to 185 comfortably in 4 weeks! And a squat PR of 85 to 155 in the same time! I can also finally do a non-assisted pull-up! Sarah is friendly, professional and very knowledgeable about lifting. She corrects my form to lift safely and pushes me to become stronger! Sarah lifts super heavy herself (ask her about her PRs)! I look forward to continue training with her :)",

Its been close to 3 months and my experience has been overwhelmingly positive! Its hard work, but every session puts me one step closer to achieving my goals. So far, my walking posture has improved and my neck and back pains have lessened. Its a very rewarding experience seeing and feeling these improvements, and having Matts professional guidance aids in expediting my progress. He is very knowledgeable in the fitness field and helps someone like me, whos completely new to working out in correcting my form and understanding the reasoning behind each movement. The exercises vary in each session which keeps things fresh and interesting. I highly recommend Matt for personal training at Blk Box Gym especially if you dont know where to start on your journey to better health.",

He started off with some tests with range of motion of my spine and discovered some asymmetries in rotation from left to right and also upper mid back tightness. Harris thoroughly explained to me the reasons why I was likely experiencing pains and gave me a couple mobility exercises to do before I start my workouts, stretches, and also taught me how to properly brace my core during my ab exercises to keep on being pain free while doing exercises. After the session I was able to perform exercises with absolutely no pain at all. I didnt expect my issue to be fixed this quickly considering its something Ive dealt with for years now and I regret not coming sooner.

I started my fitness journey by myself a few years ago. I mostly did cardio and then a few compounded exercises that s suppose to give me a full body workout. In 2017 my friend referred me to Ken and said to give personal training a try. I was skeptical at first because I believed my training was sufficient. Boy was I wrong. Sure I was keeping my shape and losing weight, but I had no idea how to train effectly to target muscle growth. Ken s expertise have brought my own fitness goals to another level. If you are looking for personal training, attention to detail, first-class trainers, then do yourself a favour and sign up at BLK BOX. This gym is not your social hangout. It does not offer you lemonades, fresh towels or spas with fingerprint lockers - It s designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to give you a proper, scitentfically-proven, fastest way to attain your own fitness goals workout. I like it for its gritty, no B.S, no judgement type of environment. If you are serious about training, do yourself a favour and give them a try.",

Thankfully working Ken has allowed me to pinpoint my back issues, but that s not the point. THE POINT IS, the most rewarding experience I ve had is learning to maintain my lifestyle while still being in track and getting in shape.I thought I was smart about these things but turns out I m not. ALSO, KEN WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND trying to fit everything into my schedule, the number of workouts per week as well finding food that I liked but fit within my macros. I m not kidding I m legit busy all the time and not going to lie, I wasn t holding my end of the bargain. Ken was so nice and understanding but made sure I knew why training and being healthy was important. Honestly, everyone should invest in one of the personal trainers because really, it s an investment in yourself. You can tell they put a lot of work in the company. SO MORAL OF THE STORY, IF YOU DONT WANT A GENERIC PT AND SOMEONE WHO MAKES YOU FEEL YOUNG AND NOT 85 YEARS OLD GO TO BLACK BOX GYM. Not only will you be more healthy but you learn proper techniques (which your back will thank you later) and have fun. I MEAN IM A WOMAN AND I FEEL BADASS THAT I CAN LIFT MORE WEIGHTS THANKS TO KEN. I m not yelling, I m just mega excited.",

I must admit, at first I thought, Huh, its in a pet store. It might not be the first place I would have thought to take our pets, but we love our neighborhood Tisol, and its close by in case of emergency. We have had great experiences here. Totally exceeded expectations. Dr. Uri and Dr. Hannah  are both very knowledgeable.  Together, they have now correctly diagnosed and treated: our Boston Terriers knee problem, my cats weird extra rib thing, an ear infection my cat has probably had for years, allergies, etc. Just when we were thinking Vancouver was some weird unregulated veterinary wasteland,  were so happy we found competent, professional, caring vets right down the street at the pet store. They dont try to sell you stuff you dont need or extract all your cats teeth to finance their vacation to Thailand. They do urge gold standard veterinary medicine, and while some people might not want to pay for diagnostic tests, etc., I believe they would only order a test  if they felt it was truly in the pets best interest.",

My beloved 4 yr old, QQ had a growth under his tongue. I took my little guy in for a checkup and Uri found it. Was not easy to see but he did it!! Then he repeated the miracle last month. QQs growth is again, not malignant and I dont have the words to to express how grateful I am and how much I want other patients to know what an outstanding person and vet Uri is. I have had the opportunity to recently have worked on a project with him, outside of the office. He shines, not only as a vet, but as warm, sincere, and fun person. Theres a bed commercial in which one of the speakers says, I wish I could give the ____ bed more than 5 stars. I feel the same about Uri.   Andy Krieger, QQs dad  Vancouver  Aug 4, 2019",

So it makes it difficult to pickup meds and prescriptions for your animal.  Not a consistent  thing to happen, but something to be aware of in case.",

Their Google maps opening hours here clearly show open on Saturdays, yet we came today from the other side of town to pick up medication, and the clinic has a sign inexplicably saying  CLOSED . We received a phone message from them last week saying our medication was ready to be picked up, but now when we phoned to check where it is, they told us there is no record of it in their system. Very disappointing. Would no longer recommend this place.",

Theyre supposed to be a walk-in clinic, but whenever I walk in, they dont have any vets available.  Either theyre not there or busy for the next 1-2 hours.  Fine, so I tried calling in for an appointment before going.  Appointment confirmed by the front desk, then I must have gotten 2-3 calls asking me to reschedule for various reasons. Finally settled on an appointment, then I go in and I still have to wait a long time to be seen.  Every other time I had to make an appointment and every time I had to wait 15-30 mins. Then there were the issues with the food.  I was sold a bag of prescription food that expired within a month of the purchase date, but I didnt know until I got home.  I asked to return it, but I was told they had a no return policy.  They said I was told that I was buying almost expiring food and was given a discount.  I was not told this, and the invoice didnt note this either.  Finally spoke to a manager and had to settle for a credit for half the amount. Another issue with food, I was quoted one price over the phone and when I went in to pay for it, they raised the price.  My dog needed it, so I couldnt say no...  Not happy. The vets there are good though, and attentive...  So it seems the issues really are from the front desk staff only.  Its a bit of a shame, as this is a convenient location.",

                "review_text": "We recently moved homes so we had to find a new vet in our area. I saw the reviews for Vancouver East Veterinary Walk-In Clinic so we booked our cat in here. Sadly, this was a huge mistake on our part. We took our cat in for her annual checkup. All of the documents were transferred from our previous vet to this one, so it should have her up to date vaccine information and other health background. Unfortunately, Dr. Shura didnt even pay attention to her vaccination history anyways, and despite our cat having gotten her 3-year vaccines in 2018, he said it was done in 2017 and then vaccinated her anyways. I didnt notice this until I got home and saw my previous invoices from the previous vet that said she last got the vaccination in 2018. A few days after we got home from the vet, my cats hair started falling out in the area where the vaccination was injected. We tried calling Vancouver East Veterinary Walk-In Clinic on Wednesday at around 10AM and there was no pick-up (they are closed most of the week, open only for limited hours in the afternoon), no voice mail, and no emergency line you can call. We ended up having to drive back to our old vet to get her looked at because that was our only option. I understand that adverse side effect may happen after a vaccination, but I am very disappointed that the vet misread her vaccination history and gave her something she didnt need, and also we werent able to reach them or an alternate number. When we were getting our cat looked at, Mr. Shura said to us that he doesnt like to overvaccinate animals because hell get our money through teeth cleanings anyways (he had recommended a teeth cleaning for our cat). I couldnt tell if he was a vet or a used car salesman.",

The receptionist service level is very professional in my opinion. They have a lot of patients calling in and patients walking in and they handle themselves very well. No abrupt attitude given to anyone everytime I was there. The doctor who sees me is named Andrew Chiu, hes very professional, gives great advice, tells it how it is, no sugar coating. The great thing about FCM is if your regular doctor is not available to treat you, any one doctor on site is capable of treating you as they have your records immediately available to see your history. I needed to see my doctor one day during this Covid time and my usual location in Oakridge Mall was booked all day, they said if its really of great importance and I couldnt wait a day I could go to their other location on 41st Avenue and they could see me within the hour. Thats just super convenient. Totally prefer this than going to a walk in clinic. I definitely would recommend Forward Care Medical Clinic to anyone looking for a new GP. 5 stars!!!",

Your reception staff must disclose to all patients that there is a $50 no show fee even for phone call appointments. To force someone to pay this fee after a phone call was missed for legitimate reasons ESPECIALLY when it was not disclosed upon booking is borderline robbing. Please reconsider your policy surrounding phone vs. in-person appointments and/or re-train reception staff to be more considerate of patients circumstances. It seems they can greatly benefit from a lesson in using discretion. Not every patient visits the clinic frequently enough to see the notices for themselves. It is the job of the front desk receptionists to make policies transparent. Such a shame to have encountered hostility from your staff after so so many years of being a patient (my entire life so far to be exact...). To expect us to constantly bend our equally busy schedules to fit into the odd schedules of all the doctors here is impractical and a quick way to lose patients. I am starting to think I am better off finding a different practice to seek health care. The current front desk team is truly mediocre at their job at best. Edit: reply received and read. Unfortunately it missed to address the point about reception staff failing to disclose such an apparently important policy. Still not willing to admit wrongdoing?",

If our patients are unable to make it to the time they booked, they are welcome to call in and adjust their appointment 24 hours before their booked time. If our patients have an emergency or a legitimate reason, we usually waive the no show fee and end with a warning. Phone appointments are just as important as in-person appointments, which is why there is a no show fee for phone calls as well. If you still have any questions or concerns, please email us at info@forwardcaremedical.com and we will assist you the best of our abilities. Thank you, FCM",

Most time  I visited her she had wrong information about my medical records and it made me feel she was not prepared before meeting her patient. It seemed it didn t bother her at all. During the meeting, she used to talk to me in an unpleasant way that she seemed she was very annoyed by me not understanding what she said. She probably thought I was a stupid. As a patient I was very discouraged to ask questions and I didn t feel like to keep conversation with her. There WERE times She didn t called me on time, or met me when in-person meeting(which I understood since she could be busy). But she was very impatient and even aggressive when I couldn t received her call on time when I was really sick. She called  7 times in a row  in total to me and my husband which I think is not necessary (she probably want us to receive the call so that she can yell) and said, we d better find another dr if we keep doing this. It sounded almost like a threat. I wish I could recorded the phone call I had with her. If you have a baby, don t take them to her since she seems she doesn t know how to treat with a little one. My baby was literally freaked out whenever getting a shot from her. It was horrible experiences as a parent, but since it s hard to find a dr so I kinda made compromise to keep her as my dr. Now I regret myself being too patient with her and didn t find another dr more earlier. Hopefully nobody had or will have experiences like me. Not sure if anyone from the clinic is willing to talk to me but I want to let dr. Song to know that patients are not stupid, and not her emotional trashcan.",

No more than  2 questions allowed to ask  even if you have not seen them for so long! The office is so crowded like a zoo!  I was put on hold with that terrible ding ding music every single call & you will be told that the next appointment will be a week later! I feel sorry for those sick elderly patients if they need quick assistance! Even worst is when the elderly dont even know how to book the appointment online! Terrible office management with too many doctors working for Dr Amanda Lau, the boss, who only works 2 days a week, few hours a day. Expecting the patients to accommodate her schedules so I requested to switch to one of her staff doctors but no spaces were reserved for us, the loyal patients!

We do however encourage our patients to book multiple appointments if they have more concerns to discuss with our doctors.

And as a clinic that prides themselves of taking care of their patients. They did not pass her clients on to any other doctor. I called today to talk to reception to ask if I can see any other doctor in the office or even go back to the old doctor. This man said and I quote  you can not cause tech you re no longer our patient or part of our clinic anymore since you were dr - patient I understand there s a shortage of family doctors in bc and everyone wants and needs a family doctor.

Unfortunately I missed that appointment and the receptionist called me leaving a message telling me that because Ive missed that first appointment, I need to pay $30 for missing it but I can reschedule the appointment. I said, thats fine, Ill pay the $30 and rescheduled the new appointment. On the day of the appointment, the receptionist called me and told me that Dr.Song now rejects me as a patient because I had missed my first appointment. I asked the receptionist, is this regular protocol? If so, why did you initially tell me that I had to pay a $30 fee and offered to reschedule? And what about the fact that I took time off work so that I could get to this appointment? Are you going to compensate me for work that I had to rearrange for this appointment? The receptionist sounded scared and just said I just do what the doctor tells me and wanted to hang up. And that was it. I havent seen Dr. Song as a patient, but I wanted to let the next patient know that if you do see Dr. Song, consider that she might change her mind last minute, remorselessly.",

I was on hold for about an hour then she picks up the phone and tells me doctor notes says he needs to see me to discuss the result of my mammogram, so I need referral to see this doctor. It was a new doctor, the one referred me was on maternity  leave so I asked the right spelling of his name so I could ask my family doctor for referral and first she refused to give me saying doctor only gave me this instruction to tel you this! Then I repeated could you please spell the name! And she was so fast and inpatient and not clear so I ask again and she didn t want to help! Very sad for people who are in needs of urgent medical procedure and has to deal with such people!",

Lovely and professional staff who remain patient, helpful and composed during this unusually difficult time. Our family is seen and treated by Dr Vasquez who has brilliant reviews on Rate My MD (not at all surprising). We have also seen Dr Cubra on occasion when Dr Vasquez has been away. Both doctors are incredibly patient, empathetic, and knowledgeable with relationships to other fantastic specialists in the community. Dr Vasquez is hardly ever late for an appointment - sometimes he is a few minutes early. On the rare occasion I have waited an additional 5-10 minutes but this is a far departure from our previous GP. I can t believe had become accustomed to waiting 1 hour + elsewhere. When this clinic moved into our neighbourhood a few years ago, I happened to ask the receptionist which doctor I should see and they told me that ALL of them were amazing. We have happily found this to be true!",

Here s what I love the most: - The interior design of the clinic is just beautiful. It feels very welcoming and is always super clean! - All the ladies at the reception are so lovely, patient and helpful. I find their service always friendly and I never feel rushed when booking an appointment or asking a question, even though they are very busy! - I use the walk-in clinic here and Dr. Cubra is absolutely amazing. He is the kindest doctor,  very patient, understanding, trustworthy and extremely knowledgeable. I never feel rushed and he always takes the time to listen to my symptoms and explain his recommendations. I truly believe he goes above and beyond for all the patients he sees. He has been an extremely huge help (especially this year) for me and I am so thankful for him and this clinic. The team at this clinic...they are the best! - I have never felt I had to wait an unreasonable amount of time, which is amazing for a walk-in clinic. And if they feel I have, they always apologize which just shows how thoughtful they are. Thank you so much, Marine Gateway MC. I so appreciate all you do for me and the other patients you see.",

I ve gone to the chiropractor, acupuncture, massage therapists with no avail and after enduring this pain for 4 months, I already lost hope and figured life would be like this since I m getting into my late 60 s. However after seeing Lester for Physio, in just 2 sessions I already feel 40% better! I went from having limited mobility and no strength in my left arm to being able to go about my day normally now I highly recommend people to see Lester as he is very caring and skillful!",

                "response_from_owner_text": "Hi Alexander, Perhaps there was some confusion on your part about how our earlier exchanges transpired, so please allow me to provide some clarity. You initially requested a weekend appointment a few months ago, and we were, unfortunately, unable to accommodate your ask as it fell outside our hours of operation. I did, however, still help you the best I could by locating another clinic near you as an alternative. Your request and my subsequent email correspondences occurred during a brief period when we experienced difficulties with our email server, something for which I apologized for at the time. As I am sure you know, it is an unfortunate reality that technology does not always work the way we expect it should despite our best efforts. When you spoke with my colleague last week requesting an appointment, she informed you of our clinic policy which requires new patients to present to the clinic by walk-in for their first visit. I am afraid you may have confused these two different exchanges, which occurred nearly eight months apart, as one occurrence, one of which was not your own. Nevertheless, I feel it is important to offer insight into any misconceptions you may still have about how a medical clinic, specifically our clinic, operates so that you are better informed in the future when trying to access care. The foundation of a walk-in clinic operates on the principle that a patient may present to a clinic without an appointment to access urgent or time-sensitive medical care on the same day. This concept will cease to exist in its practical sense if there is an expectation that clinics should schedule appointments in advance. Moreover, scheduling appointments ahead of time in a walk-in setting will make it extremely difficult for patients in need of urgent care to receive timely care. With that said, we also recognize that,  for a number of people, an appointment system is more ideal due to personal or professional commitments. For this reason, we operate as a hybrid by offering both walk-in and appointment services so that we may better accommodate everyone. To ensure we can accomplish this successfully, a number of different policies have had to be implemented to organize how and when each service can be rendered. One such policy is that new patients are required to present to the clinic by walk-in for their first appointment. This allows us to validate a new patients information, and ensure they are adequately informed of our clinic policies. While we acknowledge that not everyone will be agreeable to this caveat, it has ultimately allowed us to increase access to care for patients by drastically reducing our no-show rate so we may use resources, such as physician time, more efficiently. Therefore, although we are a business and some of our policies may not always equate to good business acumen, we feel it would be unethical to compromise the quality of care and access to medical services by operating as though healthcare is about commerce rather than the health and well-being of people. I hope the information above can help you understand the events that lead up to your experience, but should you need further clarification for our clinic procedures, I would be happy to address your concerns, so please do not hesitate to contact me. Kind regards, Marjan Amiri, Management for Marine Gateway Medical Clinic",

I paid the fee to the records company that the office reception staff told me to contact for my records. I did not know at the time, but the company I was told to contact was completely incorrect. I paid a fee out-of-pocket to the incorrect company and have had to go through multiple rounds of back-and-forth with multiple people. Now, my personal medical information is in the hands of a third-party that it should never have gone to and I have to pay even more money on top of what I already paid, to fix an error that is not my doing. When I called the clinic to report this issue, they admitted that it was their mistake, but did not apologize and essentially told me I was out of luck and would have to just solve it myself.",

She is patient, genuine, punctual, efficient, and goes the extra mile to ensure we clearly understand the issues and applicable next steps. We sincerely feel privileged to have her as our family doctor as she always makes sure we are comfortable and well-cared for. For example, Dr. Lin is mindful of slowing down her speech so my mom (English is not her first language) can carefully understand her. She is kind to always ask if we have any further questions before wrapping up our appointment as well. I also had a blood test yesterday and I did not schedule a follow-up appointment.

Pre-Covid, when my mother in law had some dizzy episodes on a Saturday, we call the office, they fit her in with another doctor in the office and follow up with a letter to Emergency. Currently, they do either phone appointments or in office appointments and most times when we are in the phone appointment, if the doctor needs to see what is concerning (a rash, take blood pressure, etc.), they do their best to find time to let you come in, luckily for us it was within the same day. They referred my mother in law for a geriatrician, and Dr Zhang is also located in the same office. Very efficient in communication and coordination. Before the Geriatrician appointment, the staff called us twice with reminders. I appreciate the calls and reminders. The online booking is the only negative. We get email notification to book for flu shots, etc but our doctor was not set up, or wont allow on the booking site.  Most times it doesnt work, so best to call the office.",

They never make eye contact and speak among themselves (which is totally fine), but on several occasions, they have would cut me off or taken a phone call while I was speaking mid-sentence. Im not sure whether they feel like theyre not valued enough to provide a basic level of customer service, but the level of care between the doctors and receptionists are not comparable.",

                "review_text": "I started going to this clinic because my family doctor moved practices. Besides being closer to my home, it is inferior in every way to the old clinic I would go to. The staff, while friendly, are mostly unhelpful and refuse basic things (like calling a taxi for patients). The clinic itself is small and youre forced to make appointments and referrals with 10~ people a couple steps away. Anything you ask the staff or talk to the staff about, everyone will hear. This clinic also doesnt allow you to leave messages outside of clinic hours and doesnt have a voicemail system set up at all, making it impossible to cancel or reschedule appointments if youre sick or outside a normal business hours routine. With the state of healthcare in Vancouver you dont really get much of a choice in where you see a family doctor, but if you do have a choice I would recommend against going to a doctor that works at this clinic.",

When u walk in nobody will greet u when u walk to the counter. It s always a  yes  or something short and rude. Secondly I ve found myself waiting at the front desk waiting to be checked in while the group of girls finish a conversation about what they did on the weekend. Then I had an appointment today in the pm and they ve known since at least 8am they will be closed due to snow but choose to call me from a blocked number an hour before to short cancel my appointment. This appointment has already been moved two times. Lastly, when I called to ask a question about blood work one of the front end girls gave me the wrong information and again two weeks of my time has been wasted. If I wasn t pregnant and in need of a dr I would leave this clinic in a second ONLY based on the worst customer service I ve ever received. That being said I love dr curry. I give her 10/5 stars and will ONLY continue at forward care medical because of her!",

I was looking for 256gb iPhone in blue, They were not having it and salesperson told me no near store in BC have it and which was completely false. So I opted for 128gb instead. Call 611, This number is FIDO helpline for fido users! Salesperson a big guy there, you might see him, told me I have to take insurance if I need to get mobile iphone from there because my plan was $43 which is less than $50! So he added it by saying you have to get it!! I called FIDO and cancelled it! So I never recommend it to go to this store. Thanks Have a nice shopping day!!! (Note-I only know about big guy that he is dishonest rest all seems good to me!!)",

Just before Xmas last year my daughter and I got a little ginger girl and we love her so much we wanted to give her a friend.  Of course we went back to Nikki and she didn t let us down. Nikki briefly spoke of how some of these cats as well as dogs,  had been treated prior to her stepping in and rescuing them and about how the pandemic and natural disasters have increased the poor faith of these vulnerable animals.  She really cares for animals.  She is defiantly a cat lady through and through. The work she does for these animals is incredible. I don t know what will happen to all the animals in the b.c in distress when she retires. Although I can t see her retiring bc she cares too much about animals being treated badly. Weather it be an issue of hoarding, owners on substances and or natural disasters. As well as her program for seniors she is right on it. We often get caught up in our busy lives and  forget about animals and there well being.  If you can t adopt a cat from Nikki please consider sponsoring a cat or make a donation. I m not sure if she excepts blankets and towels but that could be an idea as well.",

I believed the video which promised to care for the health of the senior cat and all the senior had to do was love the cat.  From the first day Nikki s reluctance to care became evident.  The cat I was looking after was in poor health from the beginning.  Any time I called to get approval to go to the vet, Nikki would shriek at me saying he is  Just an old cat.  I m going to have him euthanized.    The first time she said that, I left the cat at the vets certain he would be killed.  Five days later, the vet called me to pick him up.  I was in SHOCK. Every occasion I had to deal with her was traumatizing and unpleasant!!  A horrible experience.  Abusive. Uses pre-approval to get out of paying.  Stay away from this one. I spent over $3,000 in medical care on my own and she owes me $1500 from pre-approved vet visits which she refuses to pay.  All from the scam that the visits weren t pre-approved.  And how can anyone prove that one way or another? This is cruelty .",

My lawyer put me in touch with Nichola who came to my home, which was so appreciated and Nichola took care of direct billing ICBC. Nichola has it all. Nichola was excellent at diagnosing my issues (she is a terrific listener) and when it came to doing her magic, each session made significant steps in easing my pains so that I was soon able to walk again. If you are looking for a physiotherapist I recommend you check out Nichola. Shes awesome.",

Even my single room was spacious enough. The kitchenette comes well equipped with hob, fridge and microwave. Crockery and cutlery is also supplied. Theres also a common kitchen upstairs. A TV in the room would have been preferred. If you are a pedestrian then location could be a challenge.  Like many areas of Vancouver redevelopment is killing the local stores and supermarkets so you need to travel further. A 10 minute walk takes you to excellent transit options. A car would open up even more choice. Not remotely accessible due to being an older home.",

Cherry sent us the recent sale history in the neighborhood. Communicated with the listing agents to follow up the status of any potential submissions. Guide us how to present the offers to win in this bidding game and not too much over listing price and within our comfort and affordable zone. good news came back 2 hours after the offer submission. We were more than flattered and excited. I have heard many friends who have been unsuccessful to get an accepted offer. I would say because you have to meet a true realtor who works with you, not work for you. Cherry fulfilled our dream in one shot. The reason she is able to do it is she is experienced and knowledgeable. She will only tell us the truth without cosmetic to the transactions. She is efficient and high energy to her career. Highly Recommend Cherry to all of you",

She has a vast array of experience in the fields of healing, coaching, and has helped me greatly to improve my emotional well-being and life balance. I collaborated with her through emotional image therapy, art therapy, and other methods. We did amazing exercises that brought out many emotions, which always resulted in a cleansing and healing energy that allowed me to have a new, fresh perspective on life and how to tackle everyday problems; whether it was in my daily routines, with friends and family, or in the workplace. It is clear that Tatiana truly cares, and I would highly recommend her services for those looking for help and intuitive guidance.",

( MAK) We had many  sessions during a year period. I love my experience with Tatiana and  i will recommend her therapy to anyone who need it. It was very interesting to find the solutions from my subconscious mind and open the idea to my inner soul. I would encourage anyone who is searching for emotional peace and calm to book a session with her. Thank you Tatiana it was very interesting and I am in love with the MAK cards now, and looking forward to see you again Sent from my iPhone",

I don t know how, but I even touched on topics that I thought about but didn t voice. It feels like everything is falling into place. She approached everything very thoroughly, carefully leads the session, you can feel sincere immersion and interest! But the main thing is what conclusions I made and where to go for at least the next couple of years. Because of the events in Ukraine, I had to start my life from scratch and of course there were questions about whether I should continue to engage in the same activities and whether I was on my way, the consultation helped me understand all this Many thanks",

The podiatrist seemed very unsure of herself, which was a bit unsettling, but I decided to have the procedure done anyway because I just wanted it done and its relatively simple. The room was very small and cramped, Im not sure if the podiatrist has their own office. Because the office was small, the equipment seemed a bit disorganized. The procedure seemed to be done okay, the incisions seemed straight and I think the phenol was applied, but the ingrown toenail has returned. Everything about the experience was mediocre, and now I have to get the procedure done again anyway somewhere else.",

The report appeared to take forever to be completed (Mar 2022 - Jan 2023) but through no fault of Michaels. We are a self managing complex so many questions needed to be addressed through adapting new bylaws which directly affected the depreciation report.  Michael was with us every step of the way to answer questions or direct us to the proper authority to get interpretation. He always answered emails promptly and shed light on any concerns we might have had. Michael presented a zoom meeting to our unit owners to clarify the depreciation report and answer questions  which greatly simplified councils position. So without hesitation we can recommend NLD Consulting as a firm that truly does care about their client.",

Throughout the work we have done, Laura has displayed the utmost professionalism and genuine desire to help me realize my potential. I thought coaching would be about spreadsheets and processes, but rather, the work has been centered on equipping me with a better understanding of myself, which is of far more value and use than any spreadsheet. In deciphering the mental shifts and habits that will bring me closer to my goals, Im creating changes that will serve me for a lifetime. Laura holds the space for these positive changes to come about. I highly recommend her.",

I hope no other bride has to deal with this company. First, she showed up late even though we had discussed her arriving early to set up before the wedding reception. We had a line up of people at the bar with no bartender before she even arrived. She also said she was arriving with a complete bar set up with cups and martini shakers as our signature drink was a martini. Andrea did not bring nearly enough cups to the event and was telling guests to keep their plastic cups. She was free pouring all the martinis and was not even using all the ingredients that were laid out for her. The biggest issue we had was we agreed on either a prepaid tip in advance or a tip jar. We decided on a prepaid tip from us so our wedding guests would not have to tip. Andrea asked us how she would approach guests who wanted to tip her anyways. We simply told her to tell guests that the bride and groom were taking care of gratuity. This is not uncommon at all with weddings, and was already agreed upon in an email that we would pay the tip in advance. She then took tips throughout the night and ended up leaving with a large tip jar including multiple bills.. we had a toonie bar. I can t help but assume she took money from our cash made from the bar and helped herself. I am only writing this review because this was one of the most important days of our lives and we feel so taken advantage of. Such unprofessional and shady service and I hope no other bride has to deal with this company or wage their money on this terrible experience. I asked for my original tip back and was ignored. I hope other brides read this and DO NOT HIRE this company.",
