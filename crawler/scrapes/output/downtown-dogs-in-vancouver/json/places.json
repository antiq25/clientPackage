Although my puppy wasnt suitable at the moment (she was too anxious and overwhelmed by the new environment as she had never been to one before), I was impressed by the exceptional professionalism and care provided by Christine, the owner. She took the time to thoroughly assess each dog before admitting them into the daycare and also provided valuable advice on how to better prepare my dog for this type of environment. I truly appreciate her sincerity and expertise. Hope to come back in the near future when my pups ready!",

Daycare to run off the steam of a little puppy, training to help focus that steam as the puppy grows up, and grooming for when the steam gets to be a little too much. Christine runs a great place, all 3 of my dogs go there, with the pup being the regular. 2x week for daycare and consecutive training classes, excellent followup by emails for any issues, questions, help with those issues that you always have with a puppy or new dog. Kristy and Yoshika are excellent groomers and my dogs love them. Check them out on facebook - pics of the doggies at daycare! great friendly staff and always accommodating, no matter what you need!",
