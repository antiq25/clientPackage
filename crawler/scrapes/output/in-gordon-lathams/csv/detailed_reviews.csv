I would have given them no star if that was an option, they deserve none. Took them 8 months to do a job to find the cause behind a rattling noise in the wall, with sending two plumbers, first guy was Kevin, misdiagnosed the problem as shower cartridge issue, left to come back with tools and 8 months later second guy showed up, I gave him the clue to find the problem in the toilet flush which turned out to be the filling valve malfunctioning, a month later got a bill for 1.5 hr for Kevin which spent 10 minutes and didnt have a clue what was wrong and left to come back later with the right tools to break my shower, then the second guy came 8 months later and spent 20 minutes to change the valve and billed for 2.5 hours and on top of that got a driver fee charge for 54$!!!

Charged me $400, to change a piece of toilet seal thing that cost $20. In the end it is not even the toilet that was leaking. Charged me 2 times labour fee although the first time they came unprepared. The actual time they were on site working was only 1 hour, but when they sent the bill it was 2.25 hrs.

The hot water heater valve did not stop the heat in the apartment.   I phoned the building manager and she told me to try Lathams as they have done work in our building. I phoned on Wednesday, and they scheduled me for Friday between 9am to 11am... At 10:50 I phoned and asked when will the plumber be arriving? They said someone will call me soon. At 11:15am am someone phoned me and they arrived at 11:45am. He took a quick look and discovered that the water can not be stopped as the main valve will not shut off the water in the unit. After the plumber did a minor adjustment to the toilet and he was on his way at 12:40pm. I went to his van and he gave me an invoice for 2.5 hours of $323.41 When I asked why was the bill for 2.5 hours, the plumber told me that he had to park his car which took him 15 min extra, and also had to go to his office and invoice me, which would take another 1 hour and 45 minutes. The actual work that the plumber did was 15 min. For the rest of the time he was chatting with the building manager about some other issue in the building. This is a total scam. They know there is free parking for trades in the building, no need to drive around downtown for free parking. Its not right to charge your customers 1.5 hours extra time for invoicing them.
