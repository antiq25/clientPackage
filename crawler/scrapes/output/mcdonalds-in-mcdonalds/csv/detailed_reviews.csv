ChIJmTDNqCp0hlQRoYJ7QFFj3T4,A&W Canada,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNsNDVyU3dBRRAB,Amy F,5,My family loves this location and we probably bring the kids once a week as a treat. The food is always good quality and the staff are always very friendly and helpful. It s frequently quite busy here and I often see familiar faces of other regulars who must enjoy coming here too. Parking: Lots of parking depending on the time of day. Kid-friendliness: There s no play area or anything but they ve got high chairs and a kids meal.,5 days ago,2023-11-25 23:44:32.777014,,,,0,23,8,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104699735758548303262/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,
ChIJmTDNqCp0hlQRoYJ7QFFj3T4,A&W Canada,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURacWNtT3ZBRRAB,Saffiyah K,5,My friend and I shared a Beyond Burger meal with sweet potatoes as our fries instead of normal potatoes and added onion rings to the side and root beer for drink. The food overall tasted great! The only thing is the onion rings were too salty  inedibly salty. A staff came by every once in a while and checked to make sure everything was still good and we had everything we wanted. Overall great experience at this A&W. I would 100% recommend coming here for good fast food experience. I should also mention that we came about an hour before they closed and they still treated their customers with a smile on their faces and were happy to serve.,a month ago,2023-10-30 23:44:32.782416,,,,0,47,137,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110803789309078919489/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

Yes, its simple tasks but a task / role that many overlook, perhaps including this company itself. As shes most likely just another sin number on a piece of paper to most. In truths, its because its a simple task and many consider it needy and the right / entitlement to neglect her and her position. As a senior manager myself, I see value in her role. The task itself becomes challenging as it is all about repitions day in day out. If everyone could do this, they already wouldve. The times I frequent this establishment while shes away or after her shift, the condiments etc are always EMPTY. Thank you for hiring her so us customer can constantly have straws, lids, condiments at our disposal. A little goes a long. Hope this translates / transpires into a wage increase for her.

I parked the car and went into the store from the main entrance (not the small entrance thats next to the parking lot) because my friend was waiting for me at that door. I tried to dispute the parking ticket with Royal Parkings and explained the situation, even attached my receipt. The appeal department replied and said as long as I left the parking lot Id need to pay for the ticket. I actually walked straight to the restaurant and spent an hour in there with food and drinks from McDonalds, but still need to pay for the ticket just because I went through a different door?

It is Nov 13th 2016 in the afternoon. Its not terribly busy, theres 2 floors with the upstairs hosting one of the rare play places, and the service is on point. I walked in, saw the digital ordering kiosks. I love how amazingly powerful they are. Dont forget that you can tap on an order and hit Customize to go crazy with the most granular possible nit picky stuff you can think of.  Today the Build Your Taste burger builder was fully integrated and let me absolutely get the details I wanted. Once the order was complete it got me to pick up an elecronic device known as a Table Tracker, this allowed me to bring my kid upstairs to the play place with my number and pretty close after ordering two gentlemen came upstairs with my order on a wooden paddle, and my daughters happy meal carried separately and carefully. The men asked us if we wanted any condiments, to which we asked for ketchup to which they happily obliged. No restaurant, especially fast food, has evolved over time quite like McDonalds. I though McCafe was a pretty big deal when it came around but now McDonalds seems to be catering to thise who want real food, with real service one could experience at a standard family restaurant.  Except i dont have to wait 35 minutes to an hour gor my order to come about. I imagine it wont be like this all the time, in fact im pretty sure to expect just like what happened to FatBurger. Sure everyones enthusiastic now, give it a month and some change and well be back to old habbits.

We went to local McDonalds located in 15574 Fraser Hwy to find out if this McDonalds was accessible for people who use wheelchairs or scooters. We were able to find things that made this place accessible. First, there were two accessible parking spots available right beside the entrance to the store. Second, the doors of the store could be opened by pressing a button that is placed on the wall beside the door. There is a ramp for wheelchairs and scooters to go up. Also, they are planning to get new doors so that it is easier for wheelchair and scooter users to use. The bathroom doors do not have buttons on the wall, but the sink, the toilet paper, the dryer, and the soap were placed low so that they can be easily accessed by wheelchair and scooter users.

I ordered the quarter pounder meal and honestly it was one of the best once ive ever tasted for a long time now. It was fresh like it was just made also the fries was hot and fresh. Surrey mcdonalds should learn to make fresh sandwiches and fries also. When i buy the quarter pounder meal in  all the surrey mcdonalds locations its never fresh and the meat always tastes so gross. The fries is never fresh there either. Plsss learn from this example surrey mcdonalds locations. Way to go guysssss i enjoyeddddddd the quarter pounder and fries soo much def will come back again.

Wifi speed is about 14 Mbps download. Not a kids concentrated area so the freebies for kids such as drawing paper, color crayons, balloons have decent availability. Theres this manager whos energetic and I like his attitude towards work and customer service. He seems to recognize many regular customers and they like to have a short chat with him.

I used to get breakfast here a couple of times a week and eventually one of the ladies started recognising me and remembering my order and I would usually just have to confirm between two items that I always ordered. I am now working from home so I no longer go there, but I sometimes miss my little routine and receiving great customer service! Previous review: This is one of the worst locations Ive been to in Vancouver.  There are two women here that are part of the morning crew who give the most horrendous service I have ever experienced and one of them is a supervisor/manager. They dont know how to listen and as a result they get my order wrong...often. Theres nothing complicated about ordering a McMuffin without cheese and two hashbrowns. When I order coffee, they get the size or number of creams wrong. This isnt Starbucks and Im not ordering a complicated drink but somehow a simple cup of coffee gets messed up almost every time. They often ring in my order wrong and I have to repeat myself two or three times before they get it right and they like to argue with me as if Im doing something wrong.
