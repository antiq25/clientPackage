ChIJIVobZsNxhlQRH6dKoZiZ_Cw,Taco 'N Todo Mexican Taqueria,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwcUllcnZnRRAB,Kar Ma,5,I got hungry and put  tacos  into my google maps and I THANKFULLY was brought here. The menu has pictures and descriptions of everything but I knew I wanted tacos. I was thrilled to be charged only $20 for 4 tacos and a Jarrito. The tacos were beautiful and delicious - exactly what I wanted. I read through other reviews and I m confused how someone could complain! I am definitely coming back here again. Kid-friendliness: They sell Mexican candy and toys at very low prices!

ChIJIVobZsNxhlQRH6dKoZiZ_Cw,Taco 'N Todo Mexican Taqueria,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURob04tblJREAE,Katherine,5,"Found them on Instagram and were super excited to have an authentic Mexican restaurant close to our place. We also love the idea of supporting a small, local business. To start, the service was wonderful. We were helped in good time, assisted with menu options, and had a nice little chat at the end of our visit. The restaurant itself is super cute! Bar style seating with lots of beautiful decorations. Now, to the best part, the food ! I ordered the enchiladas papas, which is their Mexican enchiladas with grilled potatoes that are cooked with onions as the filling. As a vegetarian I was stoked to see that they had 4 different options for fillings that could replace meat. The portions were great as were the flavors. I topped it with a little bit of Pico de Gallo and one of the (many!) sauces they have available. I also really liked that they had the sauces on ice for freshness! My boyfriend ordered 4 asada tacos with a side of Pico de Gallo. He commented that the meat was cooked perfectly, Pico was on point and everything tasted fresh. Portions were also perfect. We both would consider Mexican food as our favorite cuisine and while we arent experts in the authenticity (maybe a trip to Mexico is finally in order!) we have eaten at ALOT of Mexican restaurants in Vancouver and can confidently say that Taco N Todo is one of the best by far. Vegetarian options: They had 4 options for vegetarian filling. They can substitute easily! Parking: Paid street parking is available out front along Fraser street. There are also pay parking lots across the street in the alley.",9 months ago,2023-03-02 20:46:06.975176,"Thank you so much for your comments. It is always nice to hear about happy costumers.

ChIJIVobZsNxhlQRH6dKoZiZ_Cw,Taco 'N Todo Mexican Taqueria,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMzdyZmpBRRAB,Kevin Dacosta,3,"A nice, decent Mexican restaurant situated on Fraser St. Quality of the food is alright, but not the best I ve had. There s a lot of fierce competition out there that would deliver more on flavor and value. Overall atmosphere of the place is nice, service was a little slow given that there was only one person making and assembling the food, I do hope they will bring on board more staff to help out! Maybe I caught them on a bad day? Menu looked a bit disorganized, cramped,  and a little too unnecessarily complicated to read. Food overall was average. The meat was tasty, but like the other reviews; it is a little dry. The tortilla s weren t well heated either, though that can be easily fixed by asking for it to toast a bit more. Price-wise it s a bit expensive for the quality being churned out. Sauces and condiments are pretty nice. Standard Valentino sauce, salsa verde. Wish they had some more choices! I want to support this restaurant. There s a lot of potential here, but it needs work. I hope there s a talented restaurant marketer or consultant they can reach out to help them.

I ordered 4 tacos and 1 chori asada taco. The chicken, beef, and pork tasted fine, but for the chori asada taco was dry and not seasoned well. The vegetarian taco was not IT for me.
