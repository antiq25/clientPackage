And its not just a few people, it is almost every single employee. When I asked if they had a certain Presidents Choice brand product they didnt just say an aisle number & send me on my way; they actually took me right to the item. And on another occasion where we couldnt find the item anywhere in the store after looking together for 10 minutes, the staff member found his store manager (who was the most knowledgeable about which items are stocked & which have been discontinued). And when the store manager said they didnt carry it, he then proceeded to look up which Presidents Choice type stores (No Frills, City Market, Your Independent Grocer, T&T Supermarket, etc) in Vancouver had it in stock & then wrote down the address on a piece of paper for me & verbally gave me directions to the store. Now *thats* what I call customer service! This City Market also carries a wide variety of higher end items such as an entire wall of specialty cheeses from around the world, artisanal marinated meats & sausages, Presidents Choice brand products not available at any of the other PC stores, artisanal salsas & many other artisanal & high end products. I highly recommend this City Market location.

My partner and I were going for a nice walk earlier today, and he got very hungry. We decided to stop somewhere nice for breakfast, but we decided to scramble into the first place we saw (partner getting a bit hangry)! So we stumbled across Loblaws. We stopped by at the little cute cafe in the back of the store with plenty of seating. Here we found a nice selection of gelato, assortment of coffees, bakery buns, and ofcourse, breakfast sandwiches. Although, they only had the breakfast sandwich on the menu as the only option for breakfast, we looked no further into buying one. My partner ordered a very nice Americano and two of the breakfast sandwiches, and I ordered one. The breakfast sandwiches were only 3.99 each (served on your choice of brioche, croissant or bagel) with grilled bacon, American cheese and an egg with lettuce and tomato. It kept us full and it definitely satisfied my partners tummy. The girls working here are also delightful and give you a good portion!

I went home garbed my old box with my old receipt and went back to prove it. She wasnt there and someone else who helped me found out that second half of my prescription was forgotten to give me.

If it happened once, OK but it happens every time for over 3 years. How is that even possible?

Unfortunately, it was marred by the behavior of the male pharmacist on duty, who was not only rude but also condescending. This kind of treatment is unacceptable, especially in a place that is supposed to provide care and support to customers. My Mum, who is already dealing with health issues, should not have had to endure such disrespectful behavior from a professional who is meant to be compassionate and understanding. It left her feeling uncomfortable and hesitant to return to the pharmacy in the future. Pharmacies should be safe spaces where people can trust the advice and assistance of the professionals working there. However, this experience at Loblaw Pharmacy shattered that sense of security and reliability. It is disheartening to see that a place that is supposed to cater to the health needs of the community fails to meet even the basic standards of customer service and respect. I hope that this review serves as a wakeup call for Loblaw Pharmacy management to address the issue promptly. It is crucial for them to reevaluate their staffs behavior and ensure that such incidents do not happen again. No customer, especially someone seeking medical help, should be made to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome. Given the negative experience my Mum had, I cannot recommend Loblaw Pharmacy to anyone until they address and rectify the situation. It is essential for any business to prioritize customer care, and in this regard, Loblaw Pharmacy has fallen short. As a result, I strongly advise seeking an alternative pharmacy where you can feel confident that you will be treated with respect and kindness during your visits.",4 months ago,2023-08-07 00:43:43.071022,,,,3,127,251,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116625711002928969766/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

Putting consumer needs first, need to be a key element of the workplace culture. Without good customer service, who one cares if this store can get the right pills in a container (any pharmacy can do this). Pharmacy improvements could include: improvements to workplace culture thereby improving the satisfaction of the workers which in turn trickles down to the customers, friendliness, having Rxs ready when the pharmacy say they will be ready, fulling Rxs faxed in by physicians offices, calling customer/doctor to clarify (instead of waiting until the customer shows up) thereby forcing the customer to wait another 30 mins, calling the customer when the Prescription cant be filled.

During the COVID pandemic a wonderful young pharmacist (Lay Shah) worked really hard to work with his customers ensuring that they have accurate and appropriate information.  When I needed various vaccines over the past 3 years, he ensured that I was informed, understood all of the effects of the same.   What totally and forever impressed me and created a super fan was a couple of weeks ago.  Lay was the only person (bearing in mind that he is a pharmacist) accepting drop-off and pickup orders.  I didnt have the time to wait so continued on my shopping journey.  As I was leaving the store, Lay asked if I needed to renew a scrip I said yes, he asked how many meds I needed, I said all 4 and off he want to prepare my monthly order.  Didnt ask my name, no hassle, he just knew what needed to be done.  When I picked up my order today (post December 31st, he understood that I needed the scrip renewal in the last fiscal year, which was reflected. In my opinion Lay goes the extra mile, knows his customers, their needs and is always respectful, always helpful , and always responsive.  Employee of the Year Award, if there is one, is owned by Lay.  Many thanks for all of your hard work, dedication, for being there when lots of people havent been. All the very best to you Lay and your family.  I wish each of you a happy, safe and healthy New Year.

Prescriptions rarely ready on time (even when phoned in days in advance), always a long, slow line up, and theres no care for privacy. All of my medications were laid out directly in front of another customer today because only one of the 2 tills actually has a debit machine (so much for medical confidentiality). It was the last straw for me - I will never fill another prescription here again.",10 months ago,2023-02-07 00:43:52.223804,,,,1,27,47,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111012626615001327160/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

They do not even notify customers when they receive a prescription or even when customers medication is sitting in their shelves and ready for pick up.   Poor customer service. Ordered 3 months worth of medication and at least 3 weeks worth of the med they gave expires next week ... seriously?!?! I went back to get it changed and they did but all that trouble just because some staff didnt do their job! Check their white lab gowns - the one that pharmacists and staff should wear during their work hours - it seems they dont wash them and staff just takes turn taking them out of their closet to wear without even looking if its clean or not.  Try looking at it when you are paying or submitting your Rx, seems like the last time it has seen the washing machine was eons ago or has it even seen one?",a year ago,2022-12-07 00:43:52.227728,,,,0,4,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110267816498776319790/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,

It was severely understaffed, which I understand but a new pharmacist (no name-tag, has a very squeaky voice) had no idea what she was doing. I waited 1 hour and 50 minutes to pickup a prescription that was already filled out and available for pickup. She said she was unable to find it and asked me to come back in 15-20 minutes. When I returned, she said she wasn t able to find it and would search more thoroughly. I m not the type of person to complain, so I was seated in the waiting room while she decided to process new patients instead of searching for my prescription. Everytime I checked in, I was just told 5 more minutes. She didn t communicate what was happening at all. If someone is waiting almost 2 hours then I don t understand how that s acceptable. She made small talk and someone filling a job application a priority, instead of clients waiting for prescriptions. The only thing she had to say you might as well cancel our EVO after wondering what happened. After searching again and again and THEN finally revisiting the area that holds prescriptions ready for pickup. It was there from the start! Every other pharmacist I ve seen here has been nothing short of professional, and I ve never had a more negative and strange experience here.",10 months ago,2023-02-07 00:43:52.510219,,,,1,27,4,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110267667632509258878/reviews?entry=ttu,False,,
