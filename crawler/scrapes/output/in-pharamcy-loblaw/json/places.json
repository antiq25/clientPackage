The meat and seafood are always fresh. I d like to get my yoghurt and oat milk here, of which they have many varieties and at reasonable prices. I used to come daily  to their cafe for fresh made breakfast sandwiches and coffee before COVID. Today, I came again. And Marla  at the counter was very patient to customize my breakfast sandwich. Although it was busy, she still came to ask the customers how their breakfasts were. I highly recommend this store, especially their breakfast sandwiches and coffee.",

It is a fantastic location right on the arbutus Ridge at the intersection of king Edward and arbutus. The store itself is not the largest loblaws that you will encounter however certainly is pretty full service. The produce is fresh which is a good sign for any type of grocery store. Theres lots of prepared foods here as well and just about anything you could find at a typical loblaws actually. There is pretty good street parking outside and I did not try the underground parking today. Theres lots of bicycle parking out front as well. And they have a large selection of plants for sale outside as well. This was our first time in the store and wanted to see if it would become our staple for groceries as we have just moved into the area. Its a really great location and value for money is good. Will certainly come again and probably very frequently.",

When I asked if they had a certain Presidents Choice brand product they didnt just say an aisle number & send me on my way; they actually took me right to the item. And on another occasion where we couldnt find the item anywhere in the store after looking together for 10 minutes, the staff member found his store manager (who was the most knowledgeable about which items are stocked & which have been discontinued). And when the store manager said they didnt carry it, he then proceeded to look up which Presidents Choice type stores (No Frills, City Market, Your Independent Grocer, T&T Supermarket, etc) in Vancouver had it in stock & then wrote down the address on a piece of paper for me & verbally gave me directions to the store. Now *thats* what I call customer service! This City Market also carries a wide variety of higher end items such as an entire wall of specialty cheeses from around the world, artisanal marinated meats & sausages, Presidents Choice brand products not available at any of the other PC stores, artisanal salsas & many other artisanal & high end products. I highly recommend this City Market location. As with most grocery stores today, this location is wheelchair accessible, has wheelchair parking, underground parking accessible from the alley, those half-sized shopping carts that are free (in addition to full-sized grocery carts & carrying baskets) & is open til 11pm (which is great for night owls).",

WOW! 2nd time back here and it still amazes me how beautiful this place looks. I dont care about prices here because this is the rich end of town. They have extensive ready made foods, cool deli (hams hanging and aging), bakery (open concept oven), butcher (meats aging) and even a coffee bar with ice cream. Everybody can complain about service and prices in their review. But really? There are more people working in here than a big Superstore. Try going to a No Frills or an Independent and compare. Prices are cheaper there but you wont get the cool stuff here. Must visit this store at least once to see what a grocery store looks like on the rich side of the city.",

We decided to stop somewhere nice for breakfast, but we decided to scramble into the first place we saw (partner getting a bit hangry)! So we stumbled across Loblaws. We stopped by at the little cute cafe in the back of the store with plenty of seating. Here we found a nice selection of gelato, assortment of coffees, bakery buns, and ofcourse, breakfast sandwiches. Although, they only had the breakfast sandwich on the menu as the only option for breakfast, we looked no further into buying one. My partner ordered a very nice Americano and two of the breakfast sandwiches, and I ordered one. The breakfast sandwiches were only 3.99 each (served on your choice of brioche, croissant or bagel) with grilled bacon, American cheese and an egg with lettuce and tomato. It kept us full and it definitely satisfied my partners tummy. The girls working here are also delightful and give you a good portion! We will be returning!!:)",

I wait in the medication information corner for about 40 minutes while they process 10 other people who received and paid for medications. The person who initially told me to wait for 5 minutes left to go for her break and did not tell anyone about my prescription. I went to line up again for the prescription pickup line and they just took it from the counter and gave it to me. I dont understand why the person who went for their break did not just process my prescription when it was already ready and on the counter.",

I havent had much of a problem at the counter or with wait times, but the first few times I filled a prescription they kept forgetting or failing to bill my extended benefits. Annoying but not awful. My biggest challenge is refills. The phone number currently printed on the bottles is incorrect. The phone number listed on Google is also wrong. Even the automated system you get when you call Superstore sends you to the wrong number. I had to get someone at the customer service desk to tell me the number, hang up, and redial it directly. I picked this pharmacy because I recently moved nearby and I usually get my groceries at Superstore, so this seemed like an easy decision. How could it be less convenient than driving 25 minutes across town to my old pharmacy near my old apartment? Superstore accepted my challenge and exceeded my expectations.",

Also, there was another asian female staff at pick up prescription area and she was super rude. I didnt understand what she told me was and i asked same question twice and suddenly both of staff(female pharmacist and pick up area staff) they were laughing in front of me which is ridiculous and very rude. This pharmacy needs to re-train your staff there, all the staff there was super rude and they need to learn how to greet customer and also need to learn how to smile at customer.

I called them before going there, and they told me they had enough stock to give me two refills and that it would be 40 minutes. In previous times I have gone, they have taken longer than they said they would, so this time I came after 50 minutes instead of 40 to give them more time. When I arrived they made me wait ANOTHER 20 MINUTES! I ended up waiting DOUBLE the time they estimated. When they finally called me to the counter they informed me that they were 6 pills short and that I would need to come back in THREE DAYS to get them! A few of the staff members are rude as well. Especially a short-haired blonde woman who might be a supervisor, Im not sure. She seems to have no empathy whatsoever.",

It would have nice if she offered an apology for my inconvenience, or asked if Id be interested in delivery to save me a 3rd trip into the store, but the only sound that came out of her mouth was next, clearly indicating that she couldnt care less about the customers she is paid to serve, and hated her job.",

Alright, she was a little rude, but okay. 30+ minutes later I came back to pick it up. I was supposed to receive 5ml of the solution, but was given 10ml. I did research after that to find out that the company manufacturing the solution either stopped or did not manufacture the 5ml solution. I understand that its not the pharmacys fault, but I just find it unfair to be charged for a higher dosage than what I was anticipating and prescribed and not be told about it when picking it up.

When I showed my insurance benefit card, she was impatient and said you should give me earlier. Why she didnt ask me earlier? That is okay, after she said this medicine cant be covered by my insurance. I said it is impossible because my insurance cover 100% medicine with prescription. She became very impatient and rude, and said you should check your insurance first, then come. I was really annoyed why I should check first? If I check, how I can know which prescription that doctor will provide me? After she asked me to go to another counter to pay the money in full, she left without any words. It is very horrible service and I feel really uncomfortable. I dont mind If I cant get covered by insurance, but she should treat customer with basic respect, not challenge and rude all the time. I still remember last time I was there and drop off my prescription, and asked her some questions, and she was very impatient as well.  I wont go to this pharmacy anymore, never!!!",

After sitting there chatting for 20 minutes while I waited in their view, 3 of them, I was finally served by an arrogant condescending man who treated me like I was in the wrong for finally saying excuse me. I could hear what you re talking about, it was not work related, sir. However, my attendance to your location is, do your job! He then proceeded to give me vague answers and sigh repeatedly as I asked the difference between medications so I could choose one to purchase. The judgemental arrogant attitude I received, coupled with the fact he told me I couldn t get my inhaler filled until the next day (it was only 4pm) even tho I told him I was short of breath and it s just ventolin that I ALREADY HAVE A REFILL ON FILE FOR, leads me to give them a 1/10. I have several other negative experiences too this is not a one off. This is a terrible pharmacy who doesn t care about their patients health, just about their profits.",

When I visited the pharmacy at 5:45 pm, my prescription wasn t ready and at that moment they started to make it ready and collect the pills. The frustrating part is that they realized that they didn t have it!",

They said they told me it was law to bring it in when they left me the ready for pickup voicemail, but thats not true. If they had I would have brought it in. Also, my doctor wrote x3 for refills but they disregarded it and put 0 refills because it wasnt in the form at the top.  I DID get ruder than I should have, but late in the evening, grocery shopping before bed, didnt expect to be treated so badly and have to worry about leaving without my meds. They eventually gave me my prescription but made it clear they thought I was lying. It was a basic prescription for a daily med I need to survive... nothing illicit and certainly not worth them being jerks over.

Wanted to send a vulnerable individual to walk in clinics to wait with other sick people for hours when pharmacies can prescribe themselves for clear low level issues such as this.  Also filled the rest of the prescription with other drugs know and clearly indicated to treat same issue.

The worst customer service I ever experienced especially from the older lady with long gray hair. She was very rude and unprofessional. One time she gave me my usual prescription in a half size smaller box and charging me full price. I tried to explain her that this is not correct and she wasnt even able to listen to me. I went home garbed my old box with my old receipt and went back to prove it. She wasnt there and someone else who helped me found out that second half of my prescription was forgotten to give me. If she was able to listen this would never happen. Most common issue I have when I come to pick it up, it is not ready even though I gave them few extra days. When I come they act like I have ever placed the order and they dont have it in record and they have to order something and start over. If it happened once, OK but it happens every time for over 3 years. How is that even possible? When I told her what had happen to me last time, he kept saying NO, like she could change what already happened and is not able to listen at all. Yes people have bad days but I think she hates her job and her life. I am changing the pharmacy because this service is not going  to change. If her boss was her customer she would be fired in a minute. There are overall issues with the logistics of the pharmacy but her attitude is makes everything even worst.",

It turns out that my prescription was indeed ready, but nobody informed me. Had I not approached the counter to ask, I would likely still be waiting.

I was 3rd at the pick up counter as no one was minding the drop off counter. It took over 15 min to get service. By then the line was all the way down the aisle with over 10 customers. They didnt have the product I was instructed to buy so I was told to stand aside and wait for the pharmacist.   She couldnt help me either and suggested I go to another pharmacy.

Then my husband asked her nicely why that customer helped first before us. Then she started shouting, slammed the shelves and every tables she passed by. She cant even respond to us and kept diverting our question. She cant even speak calmly; its as if shes fighting us for no reason. We went there to ask for help, not to fight.

There has been several times I contacted them on the phone and they did not even pick up the call. To me seems like that they dont even want to be there. If I could give them 0 stars I would.

Even with the store managers help, the pharmacy still did not contact me. Feeling frustrated. I went in person to discuss my concerns with the pharmacy manager (Pouria Jalily), I asked for my prescriptions so I can deal with a pharmacy that will have better customer service. He did not want to listen to my concerns and was happy that I was willing to go somewhere else. He did not provide me with my prescriptions and advised me that my new choice of pharmacy will have to contact them directly to receive my information, he then tells me good luck in a very sarcastic manner.

I experienced long waits in line to drop off my prescription, and longer waits in line to discover that it was not ready, some time after they said it would be and at that point was told it would be five more minutes, not to get back in line, and they would call me.  I had to leave to pick up my toddler from school 15 minutes after that, without my prescription, so require a return trip to pick it up.  Very unhappy with the service here, I will not be returning. Edit:  I finally received my medicine, but was charged more than 5x what the same prescription cost at Shoppers Drug Mart exactly one week earlier, therefore I will have to expend even more of my personal time in order to resolve the billing problems.",

We asked him for our most recent prescriptions to be printed and he said it must be requested by another pharmacy to them. Then said good luck with that. Did not try to hold our business. The store manager told us 4 people called in sick and this is a regular issue. He also told us theyre 500 prescriptions behind. No one ever answers the phone. Although youve provided your extended health on multiple occasions and nothings changed... They still cant figure it out and try and charge you. Been looping on hold for 1 hr and 30 minutes. Will be changing pharmacies. Update: Its been 1 week, the new pharmacy had called everyday to have our prescriptions transferred but of course no one is responding. I called the store manager of superstore twice who said they emailed the manager of pharmacy however nothing had been done.",

                "review_text": "My Mum had an incredibly disappointing experience at Loblaw Pharmacy when she went to pick up her medication. Unfortunately, it was marred by the behavior of the male pharmacist on duty, who was not only rude but also condescending. This kind of treatment is unacceptable, especially in a place that is supposed to provide care and support to customers. My Mum, who is already dealing with health issues, should not have had to endure such disrespectful behavior from a professional who is meant to be compassionate and understanding. It left her feeling uncomfortable and hesitant to return to the pharmacy in the future. Pharmacies should be safe spaces where people can trust the advice and assistance of the professionals working there. However, this experience at Loblaw Pharmacy shattered that sense of security and reliability. It is disheartening to see that a place that is supposed to cater to the health needs of the community fails to meet even the basic standards of customer service and respect. I hope that this review serves as a wakeup call for Loblaw Pharmacy management to address the issue promptly. It is crucial for them to reevaluate their staffs behavior and ensure that such incidents do not happen again. No customer, especially someone seeking medical help, should be made to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome. Given the negative experience my Mum had, I cannot recommend Loblaw Pharmacy to anyone until they address and rectify the situation. It is essential for any business to prioritize customer care, and in this regard, Loblaw Pharmacy has fallen short. As a result, I strongly advise seeking an alternative pharmacy where you can feel confident that you will be treated with respect and kindness during your visits.",

A few times I ve refilled my prescription ahead of time only to arrive and find it s not ready or the medication is not available, yet no one bothered to contact me. One time I was told to return in 45 min which I did after waking around the store to be told my medication wasn t in stock yet no one bothered to call me.

If I could give them  -1 star I would, and that s why I try to avoid going to that pharmacy as much as possible.  Unfortunately, this time it was an emergency and I had to go to the nearest one asap. I was promised 40 minutes, but after 40 minutes, I was told that I have to wait another 15, then another 10 minutes. Finally after almost an hour and a half I got my medication, but at this point the pharmacist noticed that I am allergic to penicillin and the capsules I got belong to the penicillin group of medication, in spite of that she sold it to me and advised that I just take Benadryl if I feel sick. I called my doctor and explained the situation, he said that I absolutely shouldn t experiment and see if I get sick or not. He called the pharmacy and changed the prescription.  I had to wait another hour for the new prescription to be ready (of course they didn t take back the first one), but the best part was when my wife told them that their service is poor she got the answer,  then don t come here . We certainly will take their advice and NEVER shop there again.",

She did not tell me to stay around 15 min or confirm allergies.

My biggest concern was the lack of pre-administration safety checks and post-vaccine instructions to stay around.  The women behind the counter were friendly and helpful.",

In the years I been there, at least 5 or 6 different crews of people have served me, which means this pharmacy has a hard time hanging on to staff. On more than one occasion I was dispensed the correct medication, but it was dispensed to me under the wrong Physician prescriber name!!  Even after both my physician and I pointed this out to the pharmacist manager, it happened again. The main problem at this pharmacy is poor customer service. A lot of the problems at the North Vancouver Superstore Pharmacy can be placed squarely on the shoulders of the management team. Putting consumer needs first, need to be a key element of the workplace culture. Without good customer service, who one cares if this store can get the right pills in a container (any pharmacy can do this). Pharmacy improvements could include: improvements to workplace culture thereby improving the satisfaction of the workers which in turn trickles down to the customers, friendliness, having Rxs ready when the pharmacy say they will be ready, fulling Rxs faxed in by physicians offices, calling customer/doctor to clarify (instead of waiting until the customer shows up) thereby forcing the customer to wait another 30 mins, calling the customer when the Prescription cant be filled. I ve moved my family to a much better pharmacy where we get much better care.",

During the Covid,  lot of Doctors won t see their patients in person anymore.  Like me, I see my family doctor by phone.  The doctor would fax the prescription to the pharmacy.  However the fax machine is down.  The on duty pharmacist refuse accept the e-mail prescription as an alternative option.  What is the difference between the fax and email?  Why the on duty pharmacist only accept the fax one.  I think this is stupid.  Hope the pharmacy can be more flexible (or at least has an alternative option for the prescription), especially now-a-day most younger people don t even know what Is a fax.  Just want the pharmacy have a better services.  I will give you a better review next time.",

                "review_text": "I am a senior who purchases my regular scrip at the south Surrey pharmacy for over 3 years.  During the COVID pandemic a wonderful young pharmacist (Lay Shah) worked really hard to work with his customers ensuring that they have accurate and appropriate information.  When I needed various vaccines over the past 3 years, he ensured that I was informed, understood all of the effects of the same.   What totally and forever impressed me and created a super fan was a couple of weeks ago.  Lay was the only person (bearing in mind that he is a pharmacist) accepting drop-off and pickup orders.  I didnt have the time to wait so continued on my shopping journey.  As I was leaving the store, Lay asked if I needed to renew a scrip I said yes, he asked how many meds I needed, I said all 4 and off he want to prepare my monthly order.  Didnt ask my name, no hassle, he just knew what needed to be done.  When I picked up my order today (post December 31st, he understood that I needed the scrip renewal in the last fiscal year, which was reflected. In my opinion Lay goes the extra mile, knows his customers, their needs and is always respectful, always helpful , and always responsive.  Employee of the Year Award, if there is one, is owned by Lay.  Many thanks for all of your hard work, dedication, for being there when lots of people havent been. All the very best to you Lay and your family.  I wish each of you a happy, safe and healthy New Year. Warm regards from my family to yours.",

(What with the name I have on my post !lol)  here goes if you have ever uncounted a retail store that normally the people that work there are nice somewhat helpful somewhat knowledgeable then I suggest you just keep going there BUT if you truely want a store that leans towards making you feel like family not like just a friend of that family but like your true family . People if I were you Id be heading over there with my scrips in hand and asking could I please transfer all my prescriptions over to you cause I know youll take care me like Im family  NEED I say more ! K look it these people that work there have gone way and I mean way out of there way to help me out when I was I need . Way above  the call of there duty  as pharmacists ! All yous out there do yourself a favor just go and see for your selfs . And you dont need to bring anything with you just yourself and they will do the rest keep up the good work guys thank you!",

Not organized, we went for flu shot and covid vaccination (they said no appointment needed), we were told to wait for 10 minutes to see the pharmacist who came and said to wait for 20 minutes as he was busy, at the end of 15 mins, he said he needs to give shots to other people who have appointment, so it means to wait for another 20-30 mins....not sure how they manage the walk-in and people with appointment but it was a waste of time for us. 2. Not professional, were asked to write down all our personal info on a blank paper (not a formal form with the short questionnaire and signature etc like other pharmacies do). So not sure how strictly they manage the patients personal info written on the plank papers...",

I have used this pharmacy for years but in the last year have had nothing but problems getting my prescriptions and my sons prescriptions billed to our medical carrier and they have given me different excuses everytime. Started by saying that they tried billing it and they were unable to get the coverage ( checked with my carrier and superstore never even attempted) and the last time I tried superstore told my that my coverage was denied and I was no longer covered by the provider. So I instantly went into stress mode, turns out that was a lie. I know manually entering in your prescription details and getting the refund a week or two later isnt the biggest problem but it is still very annoying being lied to and told a number of different reasons why they do not do direct billing. Will be going anywhere else to have prescriptions filled in the future.",

Prescriptions rarely ready on time (even when phoned in days in advance), always a long, slow line up, and theres no care for privacy. All of my medications were laid out directly in front of another customer today because only one of the 2 tills actually has a debit machine (so much for medical confidentiality). It was the last straw for me - I will never fill another prescription here again.",

Poor customer service. Ordered 3 months worth of medication and at least 3 weeks worth of the med they gave expires next week ... seriously?!?! I went back to get it changed and they did but all that trouble just because some staff didnt do their job! Check their white lab gowns - the one that pharmacists and staff should wear during their work hours - it seems they dont wash them and staff just takes turn taking them out of their closet to wear without even looking if its clean or not.  Try looking at it when you are paying or submitting your Rx, seems like the last time it has seen the washing machine was eons ago or has it even seen one?",

It was severely understaffed, which I understand but a new pharmacist (no name-tag, has a very squeaky voice) had no idea what she was doing. I waited 1 hour and 50 minutes to pickup a prescription that was already filled out and available for pickup. She said she was unable to find it and asked me to come back in 15-20 minutes. When I returned, she said she wasn t able to find it and would search more thoroughly. I m not the type of person to complain, so I was seated in the waiting room while she decided to process new patients instead of searching for my prescription. Everytime I checked in, I was just told 5 more minutes. She didn t communicate what was happening at all. If someone is waiting almost 2 hours then I don t understand how that s acceptable. She made small talk and someone filling a job application a priority, instead of clients waiting for prescriptions. The only thing she had to say you might as well cancel our EVO after wondering what happened. After searching again and again and THEN finally revisiting the area that holds prescriptions ready for pickup. It was there from the start! Every other pharmacist I ve seen here has been nothing short of professional, and I ve never had a more negative and strange experience here.",
