Washrooms where dirty, a lot of people very spending more than usual time in the lobby. BUT NOW!!!!!!!!! After having doors at its North West entrance closed, and having security at its main entrances, there are no more unrelated people hanging around. Even doordash and uber eats receive their deliveries from the security officer making it even more professional. Now I can tell the management worked hard to re- establish this place. I really hope this place holds their security officer which is very polite and professional. I also hope other McDonalds with busy downtown traffic to employ security officers , especially once covid is over and night clubs re opens.",3 years ago,2020-12-01 01:46:17.749327,,,,0,64,127,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100558155610835972967/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

I tried to dispute the parking ticket with Royal Parkings and explained the situation, even attached my receipt. The appeal department replied and said as long as I left the parking lot Id need to pay for the ticket. I actually walked straight to the restaurant and spent an hour in there with food and drinks from McDonalds, but still need to pay for the ticket just because I went through a different door?
